            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">Under Federal law 
            which is applicable to all states, the U.S. Supreme Court stated 
            that if a court is "without authority, its judgments and orders are 
            regarded as nullities. They are not voidable, but simply void; and 
            form no bar to a recovery sought, even prior to a reversal in 
            opposition to them. They constitute no justification; and all 
            persons concerned in executing such judgments or sentences, are 
            considered, in law, as trespassers." Elliot v. Piersol, 1 Pet. 328, 
            340, 26 U.S. 328, 340 (1828)  Elliot v. Piersol </P>

              <LI>What causes the "Disqualification of Judges"? </LI></OL>
            <H2>1. Who is an "officer of the court"? </H2>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">A judge is an 
            officer of the court, as well as are all attorneys. A state judge is 
            a state judicial officer, paid by the State to act impartially and 
            lawfully. A federal judge is a federal judicial officer, paid by the 
            federal government to act impartially and lawfully. State and 
            federal attorneys fall into the same general category and must meet 
            the same requirements. A judge is not the court. People v. Zajic, 88 
            Ill.App.3d 477, 410 N.E.2d 626 (1980). </P>
            <H2>2. What is "fraud on the court"? </H2>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">Whenever any 
            officer of the court commits fraud during a proceeding in the court, 
            he/she is engaged in "fraud upon the court". In Bulloch v. United 
            States, 763 F.2d 1115, 1121 (10th Cir. 1985), the court stated 
            "Fraud upon the court is fraud which is directed to the judicial 
            machinery itself and is not fraud between the parties or fraudulent 
            documents, false statements or perjury. ... It is where the court or 
            a member is corrupted or influenced or influence is attempted or 
            where the judge has not performed his judicial function --- thus 
            where the impartial functions of the court have been directly 
            corrupted."</P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">"Fraud upon the 
            court" has been defined by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to 
            "embrace that species of fraud which does, or attempts to, defile 
            the court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers of the court 
            so that the judicial machinery can not perform in the usual manner 
            its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for 
            adjudication. " Kenner v. C.I.R., 387 F.3d 689 (1968); 7 Moore's 
            Federal Practice, 2d ed., p. 512, ¶ 60.23. The 7th Circuit further 
            stated "a decision produced by fraud upon the court is not in 
            essence a decision at all, and never becomes final." </P>
            <H2>3. What effect does an act of "fraud upon the court" have upon 
            the court proceeding? </H2>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">"Fraud upon the 
            court" makes void the orders and judgments of that court. </P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">It is also clear 
            and well-settled Illinois law that any attempt to commit "fraud upon 
            the court" vitiates the entire proceeding. The People of the State 
            of Illinois v. Fred E. Sterling, 357 Ill. 354; 192 N.E. 229 (1934) 
            ("The maxim that fraud vitiates every transaction into which it 
            enters applies to judgments as well as to contracts and other 
            transactions. "); Allen F. Moore v. Stanley F. Sievers, 336 Ill. 
            316; 168 N.E. 259 (1929) ("The maxim that fraud vitiates every 
            transaction into which it enters ..."); In re Village of 
            Willowbrook, 37 Ill.App.2d 393 (1962) ("It is axiomatic that fraud 
            vitiates everything." ); Dunham v. Dunham, 57 Ill.App. 475 (1894), 
            affirmed 162 Ill. 589 (1896); Skelly Oil Co. v. Universal Oil 
            Products Co., 338 Ill.App. 79, 86 N.E.2d 875, 883-4 (1949); Thomas 
            Stasel v. The American Home Security Corporation, 362 Ill. 350; 199 
            N.E. 798 (1935).</P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">Under Illinois and 
            Federal law, when any officer of the court has committed "fraud upon 
            the court", the orders and judgment of that court are void, of no 
            legal force or effect.</P>
            <H2>4. What causes the "Disqualification of Judges"? </H2>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">Federal law 
            requires the automatic disqualification of a Federal judge under 
            certain circumstances.</P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">In 1994, the U.S. 
            Supreme Court held that "Disqualification is required if an 
            objective observer would entertain reasonable questions about the 
            judge's impartiality. If a judge's attitude or state of mind leads a 
            detached observer to conclude that a fair and impartial hearing is 
            unlikely, the judge must be disqualified. " [Emphasis added]. Liteky 
            v. U.S., 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1162 (1994). </P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">Courts have 
            repeatedly held that positive proof of the partiality of a judge is 
            not a requirement, only the appearance of partiality. Liljeberg v. 
            Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 108 S.Ct. 2194 
            (1988) (what matters is not the reality of bias or prejudice but its 
            appearance); United States v. Balistrieri, 779 F.2d 1191 (7th Cir. 
            1985) (Section 455(a) "is directed against the appearance of 
            partiality, whether or not the judge is actually biased.") ("Section 
            455(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. §455(a), is not intended to 
            protect litigants from actual bias in their judge but rather to 
            promote public confidence in the impartiality of the judicial 
            process."). </P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">That Court also 
            stated that Section 455(a) "requires a judge to recuse himself in 
            any proceeding in which her impartiality might reasonably be 
            questioned." Taylor v. O'Grady, 888 F.2d 1189 (7th Cir. 1989). In 
            Pfizer Inc. v. Lord, 456 F.2d 532 (8th Cir. 1972), the Court stated 
            that "It is important that the litigant not only actually receive 
            justice, but that he believes that he has received justice." </P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">The Supreme Court 
            has ruled and has reaffirmed the principle that "justice must 
            satisfy the appearance of justice", Levine v. United States, 362 
            U.S. 610, 80 S.Ct. 1038 (1960), citing Offutt v. United States, 348 
            U.S. 11, 14, 75 S.Ct. 11, 13 (1954). A judge receiving a bribe from 
            an interested party over which he is presiding, does not give the 
            appearance of justice. </P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">"Recusal under 
            Section 455 is self-executing; a party need not file affidavits in 
            support of recusal and the judge is obligated to recuse herself sua 
            sponte under the stated circumstances. " Taylor v. O'Grady, 888 F.2d 
            1189 (7th Cir. 1989). </P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">Further, the judge 
            has a legal duty to disqualify himself even if there is no motion 
            asking for his disqualification. The Seventh Circuit Court of 
            Appeals further stated that "We think that this language [455(a)] 
            imposes a duty on the judge to act sua sponte, even if no motion or 
            affidavit is filed." Balistrieri, at 1202. </P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">Judges do not have 
            discretion not to disqualify themselves. By law, they are bound to 
            follow the law. Should a judge not disqualify himself as required by 
            law, then the judge has given another example of his "appearance of 
            partiality" which, possibly, further disqualifies the judge. Should 
            another judge not accept the disqualification of the judge, then the 
            second judge has evidenced an "appearance of partiality" and has 
            possibly disqualified himself/herself. None of the orders issued by 
            any judge who has been disqualified by law would appear to be valid. 
            It would appear that they are void as a matter of law, and are of no 
            legal force or effect. </P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">Should a judge not 
            disqualify himself, then the judge is in violation of the Due 
            Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. United States v. Sciuto, 
            521 F.2d 842, 845 (7th Cir. 1996) ("The right to a tribunal free 
            from bias or prejudice is based, not on section 144, but on the Due 
            Process Clause."). 
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">Should a judge 
            issue any order after he has been disqualified by law, and if the 
            party has been denied of any of his / her property, then the judge 
            may have been engaged in the Federal Crime of "interference with 
            interstate commerce". The judge has acted in the judge's personal 
            capacity and not in the judge's judicial capacity. It has been said 
            that this judge, acting in this manner, has no more lawful authority 
            than someone's next-door neighbor (provided that he is not a judge). 
            However some judges may not follow the law. </P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">If you were a 
            non-represented litigant, and should the court not follow the law as 
            to non-represented litigants, then the judge has expressed an 
            "appearance of partiality" and, under the law, it would seem that 
            he/she has disqualified him/herself. </P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">However, since not 
            all judges keep up to date in the law, and since not all judges 
            follow the law, it is possible that a judge may not know the ruling 
            of the U.S. Supreme Court and the other courts on this subject. 
            Notice that it states "disqualification is required" and that a 
            judge "must be disqualified" under certain circumstances. </P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">The Supreme Court 
            has also held that if a judge wars against the Constitution, or if 
            he acts without jurisdiction, he has engaged in treason to the 
            Constitution. If a judge acts after he has been automatically 
            disqualified by law, then he is acting without jurisdiction, and 
            that suggest that he is then engaging in criminal acts of treason, 
            and may be engaged in extortion and the interference with interstate 
            commerce. </P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">Courts have 
            repeatedly ruled that judges have no immunity for their criminal 
            acts. Since both treason and the interference with interstate 
            commerce are criminal acts, no judge has immunity to engage in such 
            acts. </P>
