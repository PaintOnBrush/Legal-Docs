    A federal judge is a federal judicial officer, paid by the federal government

  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal
    law requires the automatic disqualification of a Federal judge under certain
    circumstances. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court
    held that <span style='background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow'>&quot;Disqualification
    is required if an objective observer would entertain reasonable questions about
    the judge's impartiality. If a judge's attitude or state of mind leads a
    detached observer to conclude that a fair and impartial hearing is unlikely,
    the judge must be disqualified.&quot;</span> [Emphasis added]. Liteky v. </span><st1:country-region><span

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courts have repeatedly held
    that positive proof of the partiality of a judge is not a requirement, only the
    appearance of partiality. Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 </span><st1:country-region><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>U.S.</span></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> 847, 108 S.Ct. 2194 (1988) (what

    Cir. 1985) (Section 455(a) &quot;is directed against the appearance of
    partiality, whether or not the judge is actually biased.&quot;) (&quot;Section
    455(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. §455(a), is not intended to protect
    litigants from actual bias in their judge but rather to promote public
    confidence in the impartiality of the judicial process.&quot;). <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='background:yellow;
mso-highlight:yellow'>That Court also stated that Section 455(a) &quot;requires

    that <span style='background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow'>&quot;It is important
    that the litigant not only actually receive justice, but that he believes that
    he has received justice.&quot;</span> <br><br>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> v. O'Grady, 888 F.2d 1189 (7th Cir.
    1989). <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the judge has a legal
    duty to disqualify himself even if there is no motion asking for his
    disqualification. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals further stated that
&quot;We think that this language [455(a)] imposes a duty on the judge to act
    sua sponte, even if no motion or affidavit is filed.&quot; Balistrieri, at
    1202. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judges do not have discretion
    not to disqualify themselves. <span style='background:yellow;mso-highlight:
yellow'>By law, they are bound to follow the law.</span> Should a judge not
    disqualify himself as required by law, then the judge has given another example
    of his &quot;appearance of partiality&quot; which, possibly, further
    disqualifies the judge. Should another judge not accept the disqualification of
    the judge, then the second judge has evidenced an &quot;appearance of
    partiality&quot; and has possibly disqualified himself/herself. <span
style='background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow'>None of the orders issued by any
    judge who has been disqualified by law would appear to be valid. It would
    appear that they are void as a matter of law, and are of no legal force or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='background:yellow;

    free from bias or prejudice is based, not on section 144, but on the Due
    Process Clause.&quot;).</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>
    <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a judge issue any order
    after he has been disqualified by law, and if the party has been denied of any
    of his / her property, <span style='background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow'>then
    the judge may have been engaged in the Federal Crime of &quot;interference with
    interstate commerce&quot;. The judge has acted in the judge's personal capacity
    and not in the judge's judicial capacity.</span> It has been said that this
    judge, acting in this manner, has no more lawful authority than someone's
    next-door neighbor (provided that he is not a judge). However some judges may
    not follow the law. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='background:yellow;
mso-highlight:yellow'>If you were a non-represented litigant, and should the
    court not follow the law as to non-represented litigants, then the judge has
    expressed an &quot;appearance of partiality&quot; and, under the law, it would
    seem that he/she has disqualified him/herself.</span> <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since not all judges
    keep up to date in the law, and since <span style='background:yellow;
mso-highlight:yellow'>not all judges follow the law,</span> it is possible that
    a judge may not know the ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court and the other courts
    on this subject<span style='background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow'>. Notice
    that it states &quot;disqualification is required&quot; and that a judge
&quot;must be disqualified&quot;</span> under certain circumstances. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='background:yellow;
mso-highlight:yellow'>The Supreme Court has also held that if a judge wars
    against the Constitution, or if he acts without jurisdiction, he has engaged in
    treason to the Constitution. If a judge acts after he has been automatically
    disqualified by law, then he is acting without jurisdiction, and that suggest
    that he is then engaging in criminal acts of treason, and may be engaged in
    extortion and the interference with interstate commerce.</span> <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='background:yellow;
mso-highlight:yellow'>Courts have repeatedly ruled that judges have no immunity
    for their criminal acts. Since both treason and the interference with
    interstate commerce are criminal acts, no judge has immunity to engage in such
