<DIV>Thank you for your reply, let me clarify the e-mail for you your motion to 
dismisses, your (CSX) claim CSX is not a R-R or own and Stock (rolling or own 
any rail road equipment&nbsp; , it takes this to include RAIL ROAD Safety 
control devices , including Cooper &nbsp;wire and the poles they attach to ( 
Pole Lines) and the named Employee defendants &nbsp;do not work for CSX,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I thus ask you to explain how every court Document has the name CSX on it 
starting with the so called complaint. If CSX is not a rail road company why 
then does the federal Railroad Administration Regulate it, </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;I need not give you the definition&nbsp;of "Fraud" Somebody's lying 
in simple terms,, </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This will be the last e-mail you will receive on this subject&nbsp; check 
pacer its up dated on my filings you'll receive notice after Christmas </DIV>

  <DIV>Mr. Sutherland, </DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>Thank you for your email. I do not understand what you mean by my "over 
  site of fraud," nor do I understand what you believe to be the significance of 
  the CSX Corporation overview document that you provided, the content of which 
  supports the Motion Dismiss filed on behalf of CSX Corporation. </DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>I do not intend to withdraw the pending Motion to Dismiss. </DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>Please accept this as notice that my clients will seek sanctions against 
  you under Rule 11 if you do not dismiss your clams against the with prejudice 
  by 12 noon on Friday, December 21, 2012.&nbsp; These sanctions will include 
  attorney fees and expenses. I note that the Court has already warned you 
  concerning this issue and also has informed you that it will award&nbsp; such 
  sanctions against you in an appropriate case, which this is.</DIV>
  <DIV><BR></DIV>
  <DIV>I look forward to receiving notice of your filing the above described 
  dismissal by noon tomorrow.</DIV>
