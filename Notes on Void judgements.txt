Soriano, 4 Cal. App 4th 781—1992.       “ We cannot affirm a conviction and sentence imposed for a crime that does not exist…”  (People v. Soriano (1992) 4 Cal. App. 4th 781,785 [ 6 Cal. Rptr. 2d 138])          “… where fundamental jurisdiction is lacking… it follows there is no crime, the court lacks fundamental subject matter jurisdiction.

App. 4th 443 – Cal Court of Appeals, 2nd Dist. Div. 8, 2009.  See also, People v. Dlugas, one of the leading cases on legal impossibility, also known as People v.

They are not voidable, but simply void; and form no bar to a recovery sought, even prior to a reversal in opposition to them. They constitute no justification; and all persons concerned in executing such judgments or sentences, are considered, in law, as trespassers." Elliot v. Piersol, 1 Pet. 328, 340, 26 U.S. 328, 340 (1828)
