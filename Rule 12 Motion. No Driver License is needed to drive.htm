var WPFootnote1 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>&#160;<i><span style="font-weight: bold">Edwards v California</span></i> (1941)The facts of this case are simple and are not disputed. Appellant is\
a citizen of the United States and a resident of California. In December, 1939, he left his home in\
Marysville, California, for Spur, Texas, with the intention of bringing back to Marysville, his wife\'s brother,\
Frank Duncan, a citizen of the United States and a resident of Texas. [314 U.S. 160, 171] When he\
arrived in Texas, appellant learned that Duncan had last been employed by the Works Progress\
Administration. Appellant thus became aware of the fact that Duncan was an indigent person and he\
continued to be aware of it throughout the period involved in this case. The two men agreed that appellant\
should transport Duncan from Texas to Marysville in appellant\'s automobile. Accordingly, they left Spur on\
January 1, 1940, entered California by way of Arizona on January 3, and reached Marysville on January 5.\
When he left Texas, Duncan had about $20. It had all been spent by the time he reached Marysville. He\
lived with appellant for about ten days until he obtained financial assistance from the Farm Security\
Administration. During the ten day interval, he had no employment. </p>\
<p>1. In Justice Court a complaint was filed against appellant under Section 2615 of the Welfare and\
Institutions Code of California, St.1937, p. 1406, which provides: \'Every person, firm or corporation, or\
officer or agent thereof that brings or assists in bringing into the State any indigent person who is not a\
resident of the State, knowing him to be an indigent person, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\' On demurrer to\
the complaint, appellant urged that the Section violated several provisions of the Federal Constitution. The\
demurrer was overruled, the cause was tried, appellant was convicted and sentenced to six months\
imprisonment in the county jail, and sentence was suspended. On appeal to U.S. Supreme Court,\
Edwards won.</p>\

from today's court appearance, which I will be submitting to you to do as you 
please. Permission is granted if you want to post it. I argued my defense today. 
The judge did not want to reopen the case, but I kept pressing him that the case 
should be reopened because there was a fraud committed on the court by the 
officer. He eventually granted the prosecution 60 days to respond to the briefs 
I had submitted to the court, and granting me 30 days to respond to the response 
from the prosecutor. </span></span></span></p>

that I had left my coat in the courtroom. I returned and was handed my coat by a 
deputy. As I was about to leave, the judge requested that I wait a minute, as 
another case was in session. He than recalled my case, and had a deputy sheriff 
come behind the bench. He proceeded to talk to the officer holding his hand to 
his mouth so that I could not hear the conversation. He than made a comment that 
in reviewing the citation, the officer did not put a speed on the ticket 
regarding the pace of the automobile, and than asked the prosecutor if that was 
a necessary requirement, as if he didn't already know. </span></span></span></p>

officer inquired of Paul without issuing a Miranda warning despite his obvious 
focus on Paul as the subject of a criminal prosecution. He intended to pursue a 
criminal case against Paul if the results of his fishing expedition proved 
fruitful. He should have shared that information with Paul in the form of a 
Miranda warning. Police now intend to use Paul’s statements against 
him.</span></span></span></p>

court has thus far trampled on Paul’s rights. Although his intent was to argue 
the legal issues, the court simply ignored those issues and entered a plea for 
him, thus attempting to deny his due process. Paul now demands his full panoply 
of procedural due process including the time-honored right to litigate the legal 
before making a plea. And on that note, to the extent that the court does not so 
advise lay persons, like Paul, of this matter, the court denies Paul due process 
- a basis for immediate dismissal. It is likely that the court in fact advises 
Paul incorrectly on matters of his rights; all courts do. You can’t give Paul 
back the time that he has spent on this case. You are taking away days from his 
life. Corporations like the prosecutor live forever and don’t care about wasted 
time. Paul does care.</span></span></span></p>

Palaschak re: The law of licensure of farm 
trucks.</span></span></span></span></p>

Douglas Palaschak, declare the following under penalty of perjury: I remember. I 
was raised on a grand corn and soybean farm in Illinois. When I was age 9, each 
of my Grandfathers owned a grain truck. Both trucks said the same thing on the 
side: “Not for hire”. I pondered this strange message for many years. Why would 
you not hire your truck out? Why make an issue of it before anybody even asks? 
The answer seemed to be that if you hired out your truck then you became subject 
to a higher tax on the truck. In fact to this day there is a rule, perhaps 
unwritten, that a farmer may drive his truck to the nearest grain elevator just 
as he may drive his tractor and wagon, to wit: without regard for licenses on 
the driver or the truck - because none are needed for the tractor and wagon 
hauling corn in from the field.</span></span></span></p>

drove a grain truck again on the farm in the harvests of 1996, 1997, and 1998. I 
drove it without a driver license for a truck, and, as I recall, the trucks, or 
at least one of them was not currently registered. That is how the issue arose.

a difference between regulations and statutes. Furthermore, not all laws are 
created equal. Furthermore, a statute that regulates without constitutional 
authority is a nullity even though it be published in the books, recognized by 
the police and lowers courts, and even though it be unchallenged for decades. 
Such is current state of driver license laws in these United States. We are in

government. By manipulating the money, by imprisoning dissenters, by owning the

licensor has the power to prohibit. Since the licensor is in the position to 
grant a right or permission it logically follows that he has the power to 
prohibit the act also. Likewise, having the power to prohibit something from 
being done, it follows as a corollary that power also exists to permit its use.

the Motor Vehicles Departments, i.e., licensors, the Motor Vehicles 
Department(s) can issue or refuse to issue a license and thereby permit or

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 0.27in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A 
license carries limitations, restrictions and requirements. Whenever a license 
is issued the licensee is under certain limitations and requirements established 
by the Motor Vehicles Department (licensor), which may be implied or expressed 
when the license was issued. These limitations and requirements are often in the 
form of rules and regulations and may be referred to as the “terms” of the 
license, which the licensee is subject to. The following decision reveals these 
characteristics:</span></span></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 0.27in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Licensee,” 
as used in Pub. St. c. 100, in reference to certain licensees, and providing 
that no such licensee shall place or maintain any screen, curtain, or other 
obstruction on the licensed premises, refers to every licensee, and not merely 
such as have been required by the licensing board to remove a screen, curtain, 
or other obstruction. Commonwealth v. Rourke, 6 N.E. 383, 384; 141Mass. 
321.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 0.27in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Those 
that are licensed under the statute cited above are restricted in their ability 
to erect curtains, screens, or other obstructions on their premises due to the 
terms of the license. It matters not where these terms were directly stated to 
the licensee or stated in the rules and regulations that cover such licensed 
businesses, the licensee still becomes subject to the terms of the license. 
There can be no argument that such terms are unreasonable as the licensor is in 
authority to make any such rules.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 0.27in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If 
a city chooses to grant permission [a license] to individuals to conduct a 
taxicab business in its streets, it can prescribe such terms and conditions as 
it may see fit, and individuals desiring to avail themselves of such terms and 
conditions, whether they are reasonable or unreasonable. Eason v. Dowdy, 219 Ga.

any argument that such terms are in violation of one’s rights has no legal 
standing. When person(s) takes a license, he in effect must waive any rights 
that would otherwise conflict with the terms of the license. The licensor has 
the authority over the thing being licensed therefore his term must prevail over 
the rights of the licensee and out of respect of the licensor’s right to control 
the thing or act. Thus, the rights of the licensee are limited by the terms of 
the license.</span></span></span></p>

licensee cannot possibly revoke the license he is the holder of since he did not 
give himself the permission or license in the first place. Only the licensor can 
revoke a license.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 0.27in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The 
terms and rules of a license are amendable. Restrictions, limitations, and 
requirements can be added, deleting or modified at a future date and become new 
terms of the license. Here again only the licensor is able to amend the terms 
and conditions of the license. Thus, when the licensor makes a requirement after 
the license is issued, the licensee is subject to that requirement just as 
though it were an original condition of the license.</span></span></span></p>

license requires that one of the parties have competent authority over the thing 
or the act involved in the agreement whereas a contract does not. A license can 
be terminated by one of the parties at any time but a contract cannot. These 
authorities also show that a license is not property right because it is not in 
itself property. Neither is a license a vested right but only a 
privilege.</span></span></span></p>

even under the tyranny of King George III was the right to travel suppressed. 
Liberty was recognized and secured by all of the original state constitutions. 
Before Wisconsin became a state and also thereafter, its citizens possessed this 
liberty and right to travel. The Constitution of Wisconsin when adopted secured 
this inalienable right to liberty, locomotion, or travel on the public 
ways.</span></span></span></p>

the lower court/tribunal and Appellee should then ignore and trample over the 
meaning and original intent of the State Constitution and recognize only current 
statutes set by quasi legislation, is not only being legally nearsighted but is 
a gross violation of their oath of office. As a result the trial court/tribunal 
gravely erred in its decision. The liberty to travel and to move from place to 
place, which existed under the common law, and which existed in colonial 
America, also exists under the State Constitutions. The “liberty” in the 
Constitution secures the same rights it included at common law and meaning the 
same thing-a right to travel”</span></span></span></p>

further qualify the right to travel on the public roads by way of an automobile, 
several courts have made the obvious connection between its use and that of a 
constitutional liberty or as an individual right. This could only be the natural 
conclusion: If traveling per se is an inalienable and constitutional right, and 
if the automobiles has “equal rights” with the older forms of travel such as on 
foot or horseback, the logical deduction here is that traveling by way of an 
automobile on a public way is a constitutional, inalienable, and fundamental 
right:</span></span></span></p>

use of the automobile as a necessary adjunct to the earning of a livelihood in 
modern life requires us in the interest of realism to conclude that the right to 
use an automobile on the public highways partakes of the nature of a liberty 
within the meaning of the constitutional guarantees of which the citizen not be 
deprived without due process of law. Berberian v. Lussier, 139 A.2d 869, 872; 87

there can be no question that the defendant has an inherent, constitutional, and

his automobile or state that the defendant has not a right to use the streets

liberty to travel in this land is interwoven into the fabric of the Organic Law 
of the United States of America and Wisconsin. It is one of our most sacred and 
fundamental rights. It thus is one that can never be attacked, violated,

total defiance and contradiction to the very purpose our form of government was

are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these 
are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness-That to secure these rights,

is apparent the lower court has grossly underestimated the broad spectrum of 
rights that are encompassed in the terms “inalienable rights” or Constitutional 
Rights,” along with their meaning and origin. These rights, being a gift of God, 
were secured by the Constitution of Winconsin and cannot be dissolved away by 
legislative acts. Every inherent and inalienable right at common law, and which

office and purpose of the constitution is to shape and fix the limits of 
government activity. It thus proclaims, safeguards and preserves in basic form 
the pre-existing laws, rights, mores, habits and modes of thought and life of 
the people as developed under the common law and as existing at the time of its 
adoption to the extent and as therein stated. Dean v. Paolicelli, 72 S.E. 2d

it may be said with great propriety, that a constitution “measures the powers of 
the rules, but it does not measure the rights of the governed;” that is not the 
origin of rights, nor the fountain of law-but it is the “framework of the 
political government, and necessarily based upon the pre-existing condition of 
laws, rights, habits, modes of thought.” Cooley Con. Lim., 37 Atchison &amp;

municipal, state, or federal, or even from the Constitution. They exist 
inherently in every man, by endowment of the Creator, and are merely reaffirmed 
in the Constitution, and restricted only to the extent that they have been 
voluntarily surrendered by the citizenship to the agencies of government. The 
people’s rights are not derived from the government, but the government’s 
authority comes from the people. The Constitution but states again these rights 
already existing, and when legislative encroachment by the nation, state, or 
municipality invade these original and preserved rights, it is the duty of the 
courts to so declare, and to afford the necessary relief. City of Dallas et al.

purpose and intent of a written constitution is to preserve the ancient rights 
held at common law, and constitutional provisions are to be so interpreted (See, 
American Jurisprudence, 2nd Ed., Vol. 16, ' 321). It thus becomes plain that all 
rights that the people inherently possessed when the original colonies were 
founded, were secured by the Constitution of Wisconsin when adopted. The right 
to freely travel, by what ever means available, on public ways is an ancient 
right. The people who adopted the Constitution certainly did not “surrender” 
their liberty to freely travel. In fact they made sure that the Constitution 
would “secure the same to ourselves and our posterity.” This is the main reason 
why the Constitution was ordained and established.</span></span></span></p>

states by stealthy encroachment attempt to take away our rights and sell them 
back to us as licenses. This encroachment unconstitutionally impairs our 
collective right to travel. The state would have us believe that if a right is 
not exactly spelled out in the Constitution (such as the right to travel), then 
it constitutionally does not exist. It has been held by a sister State, 
Minnesota Supreme Court that citizens possess such rights whether they are 
enumerated in a constitution or not:</span></span></span></p>

*The constitution of Minnesota specifically recognizes the right to “life, 
liberty or property,” but does not attempt to enumerate all “the rights or 
privileges secured to any citizen thereof” It, however, significantly provides: 
“The enumeration of rights in this constitution shall not be construed to deny

automobiles since they have “equal rights” with other modes of travel. Thus, the 
defendant is here again claiming and asserting his inalienable and 
constitutional right to travel on the public roads of this land, whether on 
foot, or by bicycle, or automobile or other means of conveyance existing or yet 
to be discovered. This is a right under the Constitution of Wisconsin and every 
state, which this court is bound to uphold and protect.</span></span></span></p>

already possess an inherent and constitutional right to travel and that the 
statutes would be an invasion and trespass on his rights. This trespass would of 
course be unconstitutional. Thus, while the statute used against the defendant 
may be constitutionally applied to certain individuals under certain 
circumstances, they are invalid as they are applied to and enforced upon the 
defendant. So even though the statutes themselves may be valid when applied to 
certain persons, such as those involved in commerce, for profit, they cannot be 
lawfully applied to the defendant due to the legal facts surrounding this 
case(e.g. defendant’s rights, status, etc.). This legal reasoning has been 
upheld in a sister State Supreme Court:</span></span></span></p>

there is any one fact established in the history of society and of the law

the conception of a highway was merely a footpath; in a slightly more advanced 
state it included the idea of a way for pack animals-constituting, respectively, 
the “iter,” the “actus,” and the ”via”of the Romans. And thus the methods of 
using public highways expanded with the growth of civilization, until today our 
urban highways are devoted to a variety of uses not known in former times.

of travel and convenience, and that they have the same right upon the public

point made here is that all modes of travel have an equal right to freely use 
the public roads for common travel. In Thompson v. Dodge, 58 Minn. 555, the 
Minnesota Supreme Court had pointed out this principle by showing that “A person 
riding a bicycle upon the public highways has the same rights in so doing as 
persons using other vehicles thereon.” It also pointed out that an older form of 
travel, “has no right superior” to the more modern forms of conveyance because 
“the rights of each are equal.” Thus, the legislature cannot make it unlawful 
for a citizen to travel on the public highways when using an automobile (or a 
light weight pick-up vehicle use for personal conveyance, not for gain) by 
compelling one to take out a “driver’s license,” thereby stating it is unlawful 
to travel in that mode and putting a burden one not on other 
Americans.</span></span></span></p>

to submit to an examination and to take out a license (if the examining board 
see fit to grant it) is imposing a burden upon one class of citizens in the use 
of the streets, not imposed upon the others. We must therefore hold this 
ordinance, so far as it obliges appellee to take out a license before he can use 
his own automobile in his own business or for his own pleasure, is beyond the 
power of the city counsel, and is therefore void. City of Chicago v. Banker, 112

same legal principle is applicable in this case. The Defendant can lawfully 
travel in his automobile due to his Constitutionally guaranteed right to do so. 
This right he has equally with all citizens/Americans using the public road for 
travel. These principles would be abrogated if he is compelled to take out a 
license.</span></span></span></p>

further study into the nature of a “license” will continue to show that the 
defendant is not required to have a license to travel in his automobiles, and 
thus does not come under the purview of any Wisconsin statute to the contrary. 
This is due to the fact that a license can only grant or confer a right or 
privilege, which does not legally exist without a license. We already have the 
right to drive; Wisconsin cannot sell it to us.</span></span></span></p>

someone who does not have an inherent right to use the public roads. The

constitutional right to use the public roads in his travels, and therefore does 
not need to secure the right to do so by way of a

without it, the grant would be merely idle and nugatory, conferring no privilege 
whatever. A license, therefore implying a privilege, cannot possibly exist with 
reference to something which is a right, free and open to all, as is the right 
of the citizen to ride and drive over the streets of the city without charge and 
without toll. City of Chicago v. Collins et al, 51 N.E. 907, 
910.</span></span></span></p>

driver’s license, as it applies to the defendant, is “merely idle and nugatory” 
because the right it confers, or pretends to confer, are already “free and open” 
to him as an inherent right by the Wisconsin Constitution. The driver’s license 
cannot possibly grant to any person a right to travel on the public roads; we 
each have that right. It is an inherent right of everybody who is geographically 
in the state who is qualified by age and testing to drive. It has been said that 
“the individuals ordinary right to the free use of the streets” for travel 
“cannot be taken from him” See State v. McCarthy, 171 So. 314, 316 (Fla.-1936). 
Where a State can require an American/citizen to obtain a license before he is 
allowed to travel, the State has effectually taken his right to travel away from 
him.</span></span></span></p>

only persons that the courts have repeatedly recognized as having no inherent 
right to use an automobile on a public road are those who are engaged in 
commercial activity; such as common carriers, truck drivers, chauffeurs, taxi 
drivers, etc. See Title 18 United States Code §31. In other words, those who use 
the public roads for business or personal gain have no inherent right to use the 
roads as such. They therefore are subject to licensing because their use of the 
road is special and extraordinary and can be deemed unlawful. The courts have 
repeatedly shown the distinction between the rights of citizens using the roads 
for common travel from one using them for commercial

right of a citizen to travel upon the highway and transport his property 
thereon, in the ordinary course of life and business, differs radically and 
obviously from that of one who makes the highway his place of business and uses 
it for private gain, in the running of a stage coach or omnibus. The former is 
the usual and ordinary right of a citizen, a common right, a right common to 
all, while the latter is special, unusual and extraordinary. As to the former, 
the extent of legislative power is that of regulation; but, as to the latter, 
its power is broader, the right may be wholly denied, or it may be permitted to 
some and denied to others, because of its extraordinary nature. This 
distinction, elementary and fundamental in character, is recognized by all he

is a privilege or license which the Legislature may grant or withhold in its

because the act of ordinary travel is not a privilege but an ordinary right. The 
Legislature can, however, require a license for one using the roads for profit

Appellant, prior to his arrest, was traveling in his Toyota, a 1989, on the 
public roads in Wisconsin by common law right, and thus having equal rights with 
other travelers, such as pedestrians, bicyclists, horse and carriages, etc., all 
of which have an inalienable right of free passage on the public road. 
Therefore, the defendant needs no license to obtain a right (free passage on a 
public road) he already possesses. The State cannot compel the Appellant to 
acquire a license before he is allowed to exercise his constitutional right of 
liberty and to travel. This same principle holds true regarding the exercise of 
all constitutional rights there can be no license required before they are 
allowed to be exercised. For instance, in a case regarding the right of freedom 
of the press, the United States Supreme Court held that a law, which prohibits 
the distribution of printing materials except by license, is invalid. The Court 
stated, to wit:</span></span></span></p>

think that the ordinance is invalid on its face. Whatever the motive which 
induced its adoption, its character is such that it strikes at the very 
foundation of the freedom of the press by subjection it to license and 
censorship. The struggle for the freedom of the press was primarily directed 
against the power of the licensor. It was against that power that John Milton 
directed his assault by his “Appeal for the Liberty of Unlicenced Printers.”

can no more license the Appellant’s right to travel in his automobile than it 
could license his right to print or speak, for they are all inalienable 
rights.</span></span></span></p>

reason a right cannot be licensed is that the license (a statutory right) would

to obtain permission (i.e. license) to do what he already has a right to do. The

constitutional right, such as the right to freely travel on a public way, never 
included the power to prohibit it by licensing a person. Since “regulation is 
inconsistent with prohibition or exclusion” (Chicago Coach Co. v. City of 
Chicago, 337 Ill. 200, 206), licensing is inconsistent with proper regulation of 
a right. This lower court/tribunal apparently believes this Appellant is 
required to have a license, making the assumption that since the legislature has 
the authority to establish reasonable regulations for common travel, it also has 
the power to license it. This, of course, is a false assumption. The following

the power to regulate confer the right to license? We think not...We discover 
that to license and to regulate do not require the exercise of the same power, 
and the same objects are not attained by the acts authorized, and this being 
settled leads to the conclusion that the first cannot be exercised under 
authority to do the last. See The City of Burlington v. Bumgardner, 42 Iowa 673,

power to regulate does not necessarily include the power to license. In passing 
on the question of whether in a particular case the power to regulate includes 
the power to license, it is well to bear in mind the distinction between 
regulation and license. Regulations apply equally to all. A license, however, 
gives to the licensee a special privilege not accorded to others and which he 
himself otherwise would not enjoy. Once a power to license exists, certain acts 
becomes illegal for all who have not been licensed. Village of Brooklyn Center

“act” of traveling in the several states or Wisconsin has never been illegal. 
Nor is the nature of the act such that it can be illegal or regarded as a 
“special privilege.” it would be foolish and unconstitutional to say it is. 
Traveling in this country, regardless of what mode of conveyance used, has never 
been regarded as such because the power to license a citizen for exercising this 
right has never existed. This is because reasonable regulations of an 
inalienable right do not include compelling a citizen to waive his 
constitutional rights by submitting him to licensing, the very nature of which 
subjects the licensee to rules that can be unreasonable or a further trespass on 
his rights. In short, the exercise of an inalienable right cannot be made 
illegal by subjecting a person to a license. Legislative statute or fiat cannot 
change the nature of a constitutional right. The right or liberty to freely 
travel, which had existed when the Constitution of Wisconsin was adopted, exists 
today, as the right is unchangeable:</span></span></span></p>

becomes apparent that this court/tribunal is trying to change the purpose and 
intent of the Constitution of Wisconsin. It is also apparent that this 
legislative tribunal (a de facto court) is trying to apply new and different 
legal principal to the exercise of constitutional rights that were originally 
beyond the power of “The State” to apply. The fact that an automobile is now 
being used to exercise this “unchangeable” inherent right to freely travel makes 
no difference in this case because, as previously shown, automobiles and pick-up 
vehicles have the “same right” (House v Cramer, supra) as those modes of travel 
used since the adoption of Wisconsin’s Constitution. Thus, the same legal 
principles apply only to the automobile as with other modes of 
travel:</span></span></span></p>

the use of automobiles on the highways for business or recreation is unlawful, 
is no longer open to question. Such use involves only the application of a new 
appliance and mode of travel, rather than any new legal principle. Deputy v.

uphold the Constitution of Wisconsin as it was written, which it reluctantly 
failed to do in its biased and distorted decision, one which was totally 
unsupported by fact or law. The Appellant can use an automobile/pick-up vehicle 
in his travel with the same freedom and legal right as that which was intended 
under the Constitution of Wisconsin for a man to freely walk or ride his horse 
on the public road. The conditions may change but the meaning of the law does 
not. The trial court had all ignored and evaded the manner of constitutional law 
and rights in its decision. The court was apparently aware that if it had 
applied and upheld the rights and legal principles that were secured and fixed 
by Constitution, that it could never apply any driver’s licensing statutes to 
the Defendant for traveling in his automobile to date. Will this legislative 
court having heard the above avoid the arguments in this matter by twisting them 
out of context, and then stating that the Defendants arguments are not supported 
by case law or statute? While this has been shown to be totally false, it is 
strange that this legislative court has not stated that Constitutional law did 
not support the arguments presented! If such issues were of paramount importance 
why would this legislative court avoid this matter? This legislative court may 
find it necessary to hold the police power of this State as an absolute power 
over the Appellant’s Constitutional, inherent, and unalienable rights. This 
false position may have been necessary for them to take as being the only way 
such licensing legislation could be upheld and applied to the Defendant, not to 
mention giving the police a bear hug. The Appellant’s liberty and inherent right 
to freely travel are paramount over the police powers and cannot be superseded 
by licensing.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

powers of government, under our system, are nowhere absolute. They are but 
grants of authority from the people, and are limited to their true purpose. The 
fundamental rights of the people are inherent and have not been yielded to 
governmental control. They are not the subjects of government authority. They 
are the subjects of individual authority. Constitutional powers can never 
transcend constitutional rights. The police power is subject to the limitations 
imposed by the Constitution upon every power of government; and it will not be 
suffered to invade or impair the fundamental liberties of the citizen, those 
natural rights which are the chief concern of the Constitution and for whose 
protection it was ordained by the people.* * * It [a constitutional right], is 
not a right, therefore, over which the police power is paramount. Like every 
other fundamental liberty, it is a right to which the police power is 
subordinate. Spann v. City of Dallas, 235 S.W. 513, 515; 111 Tex. 350 (1921).

the police power is “subordinate” to constitutional rights, the police power 
cannot possibly license (i.e. prohibit, make unlawful, or turn in to a 
privilege) the exercise of such a right, and thereby “transcend” such a right 
and put itself in a superior position. These rights are the most important part 
of the law of the land and such rights are beyond the reach of legislative 
interference. Thus the police power cannot constitutionally license these rights 
because to require a license by statute for the right to travel is to infer that 
the citizen has no inherent, vested or constitutional right to travel. This is 
the argument of the defendant from the very beginning of this case, and one that 
this legislative court has continually evaded and avoided. The driver’s license 
is an unwarranted interference with the Appellant’s fundamental right of travel 
in his automobile.</span></span></span></p>

and while the exercise thereof may be reasonably regulated by legislative act in 
pursuant of the police power of the State, and although those powers are broad, 
they do not rise above those privileges which are embedded in the constitutional 
structure. The police power cannot justify the enactment of any law which 
amounts to an arbitrary and unwarranted interference with, or unreasonable 
restriction on, those rights of the citizen which are fundamental. Teche Lines

is an undisputed fact that the courts/tribunals having created smoke screens by 
avoiding the above said subject matters, having nothing to do with the subject 
matters at hand, and has also tried to justify licensing by inferring it is 
imposed under the police power in the interest of public safety. Working with 
such unclean hands by administrators is unacceptable in what was designed by the 
founding fathers as “Honorable,” now brings a whole new meaning into Superior 
court/tribunal. This lower court/tribunal nonetheless yet to show how much 
licensing promotes public safety and welfare, and thus could not even justify or 
verify. This said court tribunal using the police power as a cover for its inept 
statements. The fact is that the police power cannot invade the area of inherent 
rights.</span></span></span></p>

the ostensible object of an enactment is to secure the public comfort, welfare,

the police power, even as thus defined, vague and vast as it is, has its 
limitations, and it cannot justify and act which violates the prohibitions, 
expressed or implied, of the state or federal constitutions. If this were not 
so, and if the police power were superior to the constitution and if it extended 
to all objects which could be embraced within the meaning of the words “general 
welfare,” as defined by the lexicographers, the constitutions would be so much 
waste paper, because no right of the individual would be beyond its reach, and 
every property right and personal privilege and immunity of the citizen could be 
invaded at the will of the state, whenever in its judgment the convenience, 
prosperity, or mental or physical comfort of the public required it. Tighe v.

argument that the driver’s license must be forced on each and every citizen for 
the sake of public safety, and thereby assuring only competent drivers are on 
the road, make a waste of paper of the Constitution by ignoring the fundamental 
rights involved. The administrators of the lower court/tribunal on public safety 
and welfare are actually in itself a false assumption. The first licensing law 
aimed at the private citizen in 1933, was required for a “person” to obtain a 
“driver’s license under this act, was to sign an application stating “that he is 
competent to operate a motor vehicle upon the public highways,” and pay 25 
cents. Thus, the most illiterate and incompetent person could obtain a license. 
Anyone who had a visual, mental, or physical impairment could obtain a license, 
and anyone who was unfamiliar with the rules of the road or had never used an 
automobile could obtain a license. And indeed this did 
happen.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 0.27in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', sans-serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><span style="COLOR: #000000"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;The 
driver’s license is a typical example of an abridgement of freedom by gradual 
and stealthy encroachments. The IRS is another example. When the Wisconsin 
license law was passed on April 21, 1933 (just a short time after FDR declared 
the United States bankrupt on March 9, 1933), it did not go into effect for 
almost a year latter on March 1, 1934. So even though the law was placed on the 
books, it lay dormant for a year during which time nothing changed in the lives 
of citizens in traveling upon the roads thereby suppressing any immediate 
objections to it. And when it was enacted, history shows it was loosely 
enforced. The continued enforcement of the license is seen today to include 
everything from roadblocks to requiring mandatory seatbelts and insurance. 
Furthermore, the gradual evolution and adoption of “examinations” fourteen years 
after the license law was enacted was necessary because the people had to first 
be lulled into the idea that the State could license their right to travel. 
Where these “examinations” were required at the same time the ‘driver’s license” 
was required, along with its heavy and strict enforcement, mandatory seatbelt, 
mandatory insurance, etc., the people would then have seen it as an obvious and 
sudden usurpation of an inherent right and rebelled against it. Throughout our 
history we have been forewarned of such gradual encroachments upon our 
rights:</span></span></span></p>

silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure. This can 
only be obviated by adhering to the rule that constitutional provisions for the

duty of the courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, 
and against any stealthy encroachments thereon. <i><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><a name="TOA_1_89"></a>Boyd v. United States</span></i>

State has gradually convinced the citizenry that the exercise of their

unlawful act, by gradually convincing them that a license is first required

primary purpose to which the driver’s license serves is that of legal control of 
a right, identification, and revenue, and not one of public safety.
