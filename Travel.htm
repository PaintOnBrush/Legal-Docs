<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is whether this Sovereign Man is required to obey 
  the provisions in the Motor Vehicle Code/statutes of the 50 united States of 
  America. It is the contention of this Sovereign Man that because he is a Free 
  and Natural Man and not an artificial creation of government who has given up 
  none of his RIGHTS, that the Motor Vehicle Code/statutes do not apply to him. 
  It is also the contention of this Sovereign Man that traveling upon the 
  streets, highways and byways in the 50 united States of America by this 
  Sovereign Man is an unalienable RIGHT. Being this, is not subject to 
  regulation or legislation by the States' legislative bodies. </P>
  <P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first consider the contention of this Sovereign Man 
  that traveling upon the streets or highways in America is a RIGHT. Various 
  courts have ruled on this issue. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled: </P>
  <P>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a28 rel=nofollow>The RIGHT to travel is a part of 
  the liberty of which the Citizen cannot be deprived without due process of the 
  law under the 5th Amendment. (Emphasis added). See: Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 
  116, 125.</A> </P>
  <P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of Wisconsin stated in 1909: </P>
  <P>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a44 rel=nofollow>The term "public highway," in its 
  broad popular sense, includes toll roads--any road which the public have a 
  RIGHT to use even conditionally, though in a strict legal sense it is 
  restricted to roads which are wholly public. (Emphasis added). See: Weirich v. 
  State, 140 Wis. 98.</A> </P>
  <P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of the State of Illinois ruled: </P>
  <P>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a19 rel=nofollow>Even the legislature has no power 
  to deny to a Citizen the RIGHT to travel upon the highway and transport his 
  property in the ordinary course of his business or pleasure, though this RIGHT 
  might be regulated in accordance with the public interest and convenience. 
  (Emphasis added). See: Chicago Motor Coach v. Chicago, 169 N.E. 22.</A> </P>
  <P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Regulated" here can only mean traffic safety enforcement, 
  stop lights, sign, etc. NOT a privilege that requires permission, i.e.; 
  licensing, mandatory insurance, vehicle registration, etc.. </P>
  <P>6. </P>
  <CENTER>
  <P>PRIVILEGE OR RIGHT? </P></CENTER>
  <P>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a29 rel=nofollow>The use of the highway for the 
  purpose of travel and transportation is NOT a mere PRIVILEGE, but a COMMON AND 
  FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT of which the public and individuals cannot rightfully be 
  deprived. (Emphasis added). See: Chicago Motor Coach v. Chicago, supra; Ligare 
  v. Chicago, 28 N.E. 934; Boone v. Clark, 214 S.W. 607; American Jurisprudence 
  1st Ed., Highways § 163.</A> </P>
  <P>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a43 rel=nofollow>Citizen's RIGHT to travel upon 
  public highways includes RIGHT to use usual conveyances of time, including 
  horse-drawn carriage, or automobile, for ordinary purposes of life and 
  business. (Emphasis added). See: Thompson v. Smith (Chief of Police), 154 S.E. 
  579, 580.</A> </P>
  <P>6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;The RIGHT of the Citizen to travel upon the public highways 
  and to transport his property thereon, either by carriage or by automobile, is 
  not a mere privilege which a city may prohibit or permit at will, but a COMMON 
  RIGHT which he has under the RIGHT to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
  happiness. (Emphasis added). See: Thompson v. Smith, supra. </P>
  <P>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;It could not be stated more Conclusively that a Sovereign Man 
  in the 50 united States of America has a RIGHT to travel, without approval or 
  restriction, (license), and that this RIGHT is protected under the U.S. 
  Constitution. After all, who do the streets, highways, roadways and waterways 
  belong to anyway? The People-At-Large! The 50 States and the federal 
  government are only stewards of the People's Property! Here are other court 
  decisions that expound the same facts: </P>
  <P>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a24 rel=nofollow>. . . [T]he streets and highways 
  belong to the public, for the use of the public in the ordinary and customary 
  manner. See: Hadfield v. Lundin, 98 Wn. 657; 168 P. 516.</A> </P>
  <P>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a41 rel=nofollow>All those who travel upon, and 
  transport their property upon, the public highways, using the ordinary 
  conveyance of today, and doing so in the usual and ordinary course of life and 
  business. See: Hadfield, supra; State v. City of Spokane, 109 Wn. 360; 186 P. 
  864.</A> </P>
  <P>7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;The RIGHT of the Citizen to travel upon the highways and to 
  transport his property thereon, in the ordinary course of life and business, 
  <I>differs radically and obviously from that of one who makes the highways his 
  place of business and uses it for private gain </I>. . . . (Emphasis added). 
  See: State v. City of Spokane, supra. </P>
  <P>7.4&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a42 rel=nofollow>. . . [F]or while a Citizen has 
  the RIGHT to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property 
  thereon, that RIGHT does not extend to the use of the highways, either in 
  whole or in part, as a place of business for private gain. For the latter 
  purposes no person has a vested right to use the highways of the state, but is 
  a MERE PRIVILEGE or license which the legislature may grant or withhold at its 
  discretion.... (Emphasis added). See: Hadfield, supra; State v. Johnson, 243 
  P. 1073; Cummins v. Jones, 155 P. 171; Packard v. Banton, 44 S.Ct. 257, 264 
  U.S. 140 and other cases too numerous to mention. </A></P>
  <P>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Washington State Supreme Court stated: </P>
  <P>8.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a38 rel=nofollow>I am not particularly interested 
  about the rights of haulers by contract, or otherwise, but I am deeply 
  interested in the RIGHTS of the public to use the public highways freely for 
  all lawful purposes. (Emphasis added). See: Robertson v. Department of Public 
  Works, 180 Wash. 133 at 139.</A> </P>
  <P>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of the State of Indiana ruled in 1873: </P>
  <P>9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the amount of travel, the extent of the use of a 
  highway by the public that distinguishes it from a private way or road. It is 
  the RIGHT to so use or travel upon it, not its exercise. (Emphasis added). 
  See: Ind 455, 461. </P>
  <P>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;American Jurisprudence 1st, has this to say: </P>
  <P>10.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a8 rel=nofollow>The RIGHT of the Citizen to travel 
  upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, by horse-drawn 
  carriage, wagon, or automobile, is NOT a mere PRIVILEGE which may be permitted 
  or prohibited at will, but a COMMON RIGHT which he has under his right to 
  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Under this constitutional 
  guarantee one may, therefore, under normal conditions, travel at his 
  inclination along the public highways or in public places, and while 
  conducting himself in an orderly and decent manner, neither interferring with, 
  not disturbing another's RIGHTS, he will be protected, not only in his person, 
  but in his safe conduct. (Emphasis added). See: 11 American Jurisprudence 
  1st., Constitutional Law, § 329, page 1123. </A></P>
  <P>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of the State of Georgia ruled: </P>
  <P>11.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a23 rel=nofollow>In this connection it is well to 
  keep in mind that, while the public has an absolute RIGHT to the use of the 
  streets for their primary purpose, which is for travel, the use of the streets 
  from the purpose of parking automobiles is a privilege, and not a RIGHT ;and 
  the privilege must be accepted with such reasonable burdens as the city may 
  place as conditions to the exercise of the privilege. (Emphasis added). See: 
  Gardner v. City of Brunswick, 28 S.E. 2d 135. </A></P>
  <P>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of the State of Colorado discussed the 
  issue in the following way in 1961. </P>
  <P>12.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a2 rel=nofollow>The Constitution of the State of 
  Colorado, Article II, § 3 provides that: All persons have certain natural, 
  essential and unalienable RIGHTS, among which may be reckoned the RIGHT . . . 
  of acquiring, possessing and protecting property; . . . .</A> </P>
  <P>12.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;A vehicle is property and a person cannot be deprived of 
  property without due process of law. The term property, within the meaning of 
  the due process clause, includes the RIGHT to make full use of the property 
  which one has the unalienable RIGHT to acquire. </P>
  <P>12.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a37 rel=nofollow>Every Citizen has an 
  unalienable RIGHT to make use of the public highways of the state; every 
  Citizen has full freedom to travel from place to place in the enjoyment of 
  life and liberty. (Emphasis added). See: People v. Nothaus, 147 Colo. 210.</A> 
  </P>
  <P>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a3 rel=nofollow>The Constitution of the State of 
  Idaho contains the words:</A> </P>
  <P>13.1&nbsp;&nbsp;All men are by nature free and equal, and have certain 
  unalienable RIGHTS, among which are . . . ; acquiring, possessing, and 
  protecting property. . . . (Emphasis added). </P>
  <P>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the Idaho Constitution are to all intents and 
  purposes identical with those of the North Carolina Constitution. The <A 
  name=a4 rel=nofollow>Constitution of the State of North Carolina, Article I, § 
  1, states as follows:</A> </P>
  <P>14.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The equality and rights of persons. We hold it to be 
  self-evident that all persons are created equal; that they are endowed by the 
  Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, 
  the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor, and the pursuit of happiness. 
  (Emphasis added). </P>
  <P>( <I>The only persons which can be the meaning of the Article above are 
  man,and not a corporation, since corporations are created with privileges 
  granted by government not rights </I>). </P>
  <P>14.2&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a26 rel=nofollow>To be that statutes which would 
  deprive a citizen of the RIGHTS of person or property without a regular trial, 
  according to the course and usage of common law, would not be the law of the 
  land. (Emphasis added). See: Hoke v. Henderson, 15 N.C. 15, 25 AM. Dec. 
  677.</A> </P>
  <P>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since courts tend to be consistent in their rulings, it 
  would be expected the Idaho Supreme Court would rule in the same manner as the 
  North Carolina Supreme Court. </P>
  <P>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other authorities have arrived at similar conclusions: </P>
  <P>16.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a1 rel=nofollow>The Constitution for the United 
  States of America, Amendment 9:</A> </P>
  <P>16.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights 
  shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. 
</P>
  <P>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A name=a6 rel=nofollow>Constitution of the State of 
  North Carolina, Article I, § 36:</A> </P>
  <P>17.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Other rights of the people. The enumeration of rights in 
  this Article shall not be construed to impair or deny others retained by the 
  people. (Emphasis added). </P>
  <P>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;I demand all of my other rights, including the right to 
  travel upon the public highways and byways in the 50 united States of America. 
  </P>
  <P>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A name=a5 rel=nofollow>Constitution of the State of 
  North Carolina, Article I, § 2:</A> </P>
  <P>19.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Sovereignty of the people. All political power is vested in 
  and derived from the people; all government of right originates from the 
  people, is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good 
  of the whole. </P>
  <P>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;As member of the Sovereignty of the people, I not only am 
  entitled to use the highways and byways in the 50 united States of America, I 
  have an in/unalienable right to use the highways and byways. </P>
  <P>20.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a7 rel=nofollow>Highways are public roads which 
  every Citizen has a RIGHT to use. (Emphasis added). See: 3 Angel Highways 
  3.</A> </P>
  <P>20.2&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a49 rel=nofollow>A highway is a passage, road, or 
  street, which every Citizen has a RIGHT to use. (Emphasis added). See: 
  Bouvier's Law Dictionary.</A> </P>
  <P>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have emphasized the word RIGHT because it is a common 
  point among the authorities listed. The Idaho Code even joins in this common 
  point: </P>
  <P>21.1&nbsp;&nbsp;49-301 (13) Street or highway.--The entire width between 
  property lines of every way or place of whatever nature when any part thereof 
  is open to the use of the public, as a matter of RIGHT, for purposes of 
  vehicular traffic. (emphasis added.) See: Idaho Code. </P>
  <P>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States Supreme Court has ruled that: </P>
  <P>22.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a47 rel=nofollow>Undoubtedly the RIGHT of 
  locomotion, the RIGHT to remove from one place to another according to 
  inclination, is an attribute of personal liberty, and the RIGHT, ordinarily, 
  of free transit from or through the territory of any State is a RIGHT secured 
  by the Fourteenth Amendment and by other provisions of the Constitution. 
  (Emphasis added). See: Williams v. Fears, 343 U.S. 270, 274.</A> </P>
  <P>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, there can be little doubt that, when this Sovereign 
  Man travels upon the streets or highways in the 50 united States of America, 
  he does so as a matter of RIGHT and not privilege. The authority for such 
  travel is described variously as a RIGHT, a COMMON RIGHT, an ABSOLUTE RIGHT, 
  an IN/UNALIENABLE RIGHT, and a RIGHT protected by the Constitution of the 
  United States for the United States of America. Let us then examine the 
  importance of these terms to this Sovereign Man by defining their meaning. 
</P>
  <P>23.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a51 rel=nofollow>RIGHT -- In law, (a) an 
  enforceable claim or title to any subject matter whatever; (b) one's claim to 
  something out of possession; (c) a power, prerogative, or <I>privilege </I>as 
  when the word is applied to <I>a corporation </I>. (Emphasis added). See: 
  Webster Unabridged Dictionary. </A></P>
  <P>23.2&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a15 rel=nofollow>RIGHT -- As relates to the 
  person, RIGHTS are absolute or relative; absolute RIGHTS, such as every 
  individual born or living in this country (and not an alien enemy) is 
  constantly clothed with, and relate to his own personal security of life, 
  limbs, body, health, and reputation; or to his personal liberty; RIGHTS which 
  attach upon every person immediately upon his birth in the kings dominion, and 
  even upon a slave the instant he lands within the same. (Emphasis added). See: 
  1 Chitty Pr. 32. </A></P>
  <P>23.3&nbsp;&nbsp;RIGHT -- A legal RIGHT, a constitutional RIGHT means a 
  RIGHT protected by the law, by the constitution, but government does not 
  create the idea of RIGHT or original RIGHTS; it acknowledges them. . . . 
  (Emphasis added). See: Bouvier's Law Dictionary, 1914, p. 2961. </P>
  <P>23.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolute RIGHT -- Without any condition or incumbrance as 
  an absolute bond, simplex obligatio, in distinction from a conditional bond; 
  an absolute estate, one that is free from all manner of conditions or 
  incumbrance. A rule is said to be absolute when, on the hearing, it is 
  confirmed. (Emphasis added). See: Bouvier's Law Dictionary. </P>
  <P>23.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Unalienable -- A word denoting the condition of those 
  things, the property in which cannot be lawfully transferred from one person 
  to another. (Emphasis added). See: Bouvier's Law Dictionary. </P>
  <P>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;It shows from these definitions that the States have an 
  obligation to acknowledge the RIGHT of this Sovereign Man to travel on the 
  streets or highways in the 50 united States of America. Further, the States 
  have the duty to refrain from interferring with this RIGHT and to protect this 
  RIGHT and to enforce the claim of this Sovereign Man to it. </P>
  <P>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if this Sovereign Man has the absolute RIGHT to move 
  about on the streets or highways, does that RIGHT include the RIGHT to travel 
  in a vehicle upon the streets or highways? The Supreme Court of the State of 
  Texas has made comments that are an appropriate response to this question. 
</P>
  <P>25.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a40 rel=nofollow>Property in a thing consists not 
  merely in its ownership and possession, but in the unrestricted RIGHT of use, 
  enjoyment and disposal. Anything which destroys any of these elements of 
  property, to that extent destroys the property itself. The substantial value 
  of property lies in its use. If the RIGHT of use be denied, the value of the 
  property is annihilated and ownership is rendered a barren RIGHT. Therefore, a 
  law which forbids the use of a certain kind of property, strips it of an 
  essential attribute and in actual result proscribes its ownership. (Emphasis 
  added). See: Spann v. City of Dallas, 235 S.W. 513. </A></P>
  <P>26.&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a33 rel=nofollow>These words of the Supreme Court 
  of Texas are of particular importance in Idaho because the Idaho Supreme Court 
  quoted the Supreme Court of Texas and used these exact words in rendering its 
  decision in the case of O'Conner v. City of Moscow, 69 Idaho 37. The Supreme 
  Court of Texas went on to say further;</A> </P>
  <P>26.1&nbsp;&nbsp;To secure their property was one of the great ends for 
  which men entered into society. The RIGHT to acquire and own property, and to 
  deal with it and use it as the owner chooses, so long as the use harms nobody, 
  is a natural RIGHT. It does not owe its origin to constitutions. It existed 
  before them. It is a part of the Citizen's natural liberty--an expression of 
  his freedom, guaranteed as inviolate by every American Bill of RIGHTS.

  <P>PROPERTY </P></CENTER>
  <P>27.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Bouvier's Law Dictionary defines; </P>
  <P>27.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a27 rel=nofollow>Property -- The ownership of 
  property implies its use in the prosecution of any legitimate business which 
  is not a nuisance in itself. See: In re Hong Wah, 82 Fed. 623.</A> </P>
  <P>28.&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States Supreme Court states: </P>
  <P>28.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Constitution and laws passed within its 
  authority are by the express terms of that instrument made the supreme law of 
  the land. The Fourteenth Amendment protects life, liberty, and property from 
  invasion by the States without due process of law. </P>
  <P>28.2&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a18 rel=nofollow>Property is more than the mere 
  thing which a person owns. It is elementary that it includes the "RIGHT" to 
  acquire, use and dispose of it. (Emphasis added). See: Buchanan v. Warley 245 
  U.S. 60, 74.</A> </P>
  <P>29.&nbsp;&nbsp;These authorities point out that the RIGHT to own property 
  includes the RIGHT to use it. The reasonable use of an automobile is to travel 
  upon the streets or highways on which this Sovereign Man has an absolute RIGHT 
  to use for the purposes of travel. The definitions in Title 49 Chapter 3 of 
  the Idaho Code positively declare the RIGHT of this Sovereign Man to travel in 
  a vehicle upon the streets or highways in Idaho. </P>

  <P>30.7&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitutions of the United States and the States 
  guarantees this Sovereign Man the RIGHT to own property. The Supreme Courts of 
  North Carolina and Texas have affirmed that the RIGHT to own property includes 
  the RIGHT to use it while its use harms nobody. If that property is an 
  automobile, it is included in the definitions of vehicle and motor vehicle in 
  the Idaho Code Title 49 Chapter 3. And in the same Idaho Code Chapter, streets 
  or highways are defined as the place where vehicles are used by the public as 
  a matter of RIGHT. Thus it shows that this Sovereign Man has the RIGHT to use 
  a vehicle on the streets or highways in 50 united States of America. </P>
  <P>31.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if this Sovereign Man has the RIGHT to use a vehicle on 
  the streets or highways in the 50 united States of America, to what extent can 
  the States regulate or diminish that RIGHT? There are some who maintain that 
  specific performance is required of every Sovereign Man who uses a vehicle 
  upon the streets or highways in the 50 united States of America. Let us 
  examine this contention in detail. </P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <CENTER>
  <P>CONTRACT? </P></CENTER>
  <P>32.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific performance is a term used to designate an action 
  in equity in which a party to a contract asks the court to order the other 
  party to carry out the contract which he has failed or refused to perform. 
  Thus, if specific performance is expected, a contract must exist. The question 
  then becomes: What are the terms of the contract and when was it executed and 
  by whom? Since specific performance seems expected of every user of a vehicle 
  on the streets or highways in the 50 united States of America, the user of a 
  vehicle seems one of the parties to the supposed contract. And since the State 
  seems the party demanding specific performance, the State is the other party 
  to the contract. So the supposed contract exists between the user of a vehicle 
  and the State. When was this contract executed and what are its' terms? Some 
  contend that when a user of a vehicle avails himself of the "privilege" of 
  driving on public thoroughfares that he enters a contract with the State that 
  requires him to abide with all the laws in the union of States' Statutes. 
  Others contend that the contract is executed when a driver's license is 
  obtained. We need now to figure out what is a contract. </P>
  <P>33.&nbsp;&nbsp;A contract may be defined as an agreement enforceable in 
  court between two or more parties, for a sufficient consideration to do or not 
  to do some specified thing or things. Thus, a contract has four essential 
  features: </P>
  <P>33.1&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be an agreement. </P>
  <P>33.2&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be at least two parties to the contract. </P>
  <P>33.3&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a consideration. </P>
  <P>33.4&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be an obligation or thing to be done. </P>
  <P>34.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several types of contracts exist but all must contain the 
  essential features listed. Contracts can be classified under three principal 
  categories: </P>
  <P>34.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Express </P>
  <P>34.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Implied </P>
  <P>34.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Quasi </P>
  <P>35.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quasi contracts, while being called contracts are not really 
  contracts, will not be considered in this discussion of contracts but will be 
  considered in a separation section later. </P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <CENTER>
  <P>UNILATERAL &amp; BILATERAL CONTRACTS </P></CENTER>
  <P>36.&nbsp;&nbsp;There can also be unilateral and bilateral contracts that is 
  presumed can exist under some or all the above headings. Let us examine each 
  above types of contracts to see if the license obtained by this Sovereign Man 
  falls under any of the categories of contract. </P>
  <P>36.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a48 rel=nofollow>An express contract is one in 
  which the agreement of the parties is fully stated in words, and it may be 
  either written or oral, or partly written and partly oral. See: Bergh Business 
  Law 30.</A> </P>
  <P>36.2&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a30 rel=nofollow>A true implied contract is an 
  agreement of the parties arrived at from their acts and conduct viewed in the 
  light of surrounding circumstances, and not from their words either spoken or 
  written. Like an express contract, it grows out of the intention of the 
  parties to the transaction and there must be a meeting of the minds. See: 
  McKevitt et al v. Golden Age Breweries, Inc., 126 P.2d 1077 (1942).</A> </P>
  <P>36.3&nbsp;&nbsp;License -- Authority to do some act or carry on some trade 
  or business, in its nature lawful but prohibited statute, except with the 
  permission of the civil authority or which would otherwise be unlawful. See: 
  Bouvier's Law Dict. </P>
  <P>37.&nbsp;&nbsp;With these definitions in mind, let us examine a driver's 
  license to see if it is a contract. The driver's license itself is a small 
  plastic card approximately 55 millimeters by 86 millimeters in size. It 
  contains the words (State) Motor Vehicle Driver's license; the name, address, 
  signature, and physical description of the user; a pair of identifying 
  numbers; a photograph; and the signature of the director of the Department of 
  Motor Vehicles/Law Enforcement. Obviously, this cannot be an express agreement 
  because there are no statements to constitute an agreement. Are there two 
  parties to the "contract?" There are two signatures but both are copies, thus 
  invalidating the "contract" so there are no parties to the "contract." Is 
  there a consideration? What has the State given this Sovereign Man in return 
  for this Sovereign Man's obligation? Some may suggest that the State has given 
  this Sovereign Man the privilege of driving on the streets or highways in the 
  50 united States of America. But this Sovereign Man already has the RIGHT to 
  drive on the streets or highways in 50 united States of America, and the State 
  cannot require this Sovereign Man to give up a RIGHT to obtain a privilege. 
  </P>
  <P>38.&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a16 rel=nofollow>An Iowa statute that requires that 
  every foreign corporation named in it shall as a condition for obtaining a 
  permit to transact business in Iowa, stipulate that it will not remove into 
  the federal court certain suits that it would by the laws of the United States 
  have a RIGHT to a permit dependant upon the surrender by the foreign 
  corporation of a privilege secured to it by the Constitution and laws of the 
  United States. Bouvier's Law Dictionary quoting Barron v. Burnside 121 U.S. 
  186. </A></P>
  <P>38.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The full significance of the clause law of the land is said 
  by Ruffin, C. J. to be that statutes that would deprive a Citizen of the 
  RIGHTS of person or property without a regular trial according to the course 
  and usage of the common law would not be the law of the land. (Emphasis 
  added). See: Bouvier's Law Dictionary quoting Hoke v. Henderson, 15 N.C. 15, 
  25 AM Dec 677. </P>
  <P>39.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be foolish for this Sovereign Man to exchange a 
  RIGHT for a privilege since it would mean giving up valuable property in 
  exchange for something having less value. Is it possible for this Sovereign 
  Man to do such a thing? </P>
  <P>39.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Consent -- In criminal Law. No act shall be deemed a crime 
  if done with the consent of the party injured, unless it be committed in 
  public, and is likely to provoke a breach of the peace, or tends to the injury 
  of a third party; provided no consent can be given which will deprive the 
  consenter of any unalienable RIGHT. (Emphasis added). See: Bouvier's Law 
  Dictionary. </P>
  <P>40.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, even if this Sovereign Man wanted to do so, he could 
  not give up his RIGHT to travel on the streets or highways in the 50 united 
  States of America or exchange it for the privilege of having a driver's 
  license. Thus, in exchange for the supposed obligation of this Sovereign Man, 
  the State has given nothing. Thus, there is no consideration. </P>
  <P>41.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be contended that the seal on the driver's license is 
  sufficient consideration by the State. It is true that under the common law, 
  the question of consideration could not be raised concerning a contract under 
  seal. The seal provided conclusive presumption of a consideration. Still, 
  States have abolished by statute the common law presumption of consideration 
  and this statute is binding upon all officers and employees of the State. So, 
  though a seal may be present, it is not evidence of consideration in the 50 
  united States of America. Of course, the document in question is a contrived 
  and copied document and lacks validity in any case as a contract. </P>
  <P>42.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to an obligation, since the license contains no statement 
  of agreement, since there are no parties to any agreement, and since there is 
  no consideration, there can be no obligation. The driver's license thus is not 
  a contract since it fails to contain any of the four essential features of a 
  contract. </P>
  <P>43.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the driver's license be an implied contract? The same 
  elements must exist in an implied contract as exist in an express contract. 
  The only difference is that an implied contract is not written or spoken and 
  the elements of the contract are shown by the acts and conduct of the parties 
  involved. With respect to this Sovereign Man, there was certainly no meeting 
  of the minds else this brief would not result. It was never the intention of 
  this Sovereign Man to give up constitutional guaranteed RIGHTS to accept a 
  privilege from the State. Such an action would be ridiculous. This could only 
  be done in a socialistic state. There cannot be an implied agreement in a free 
  society. Is it possible that there were two parties to the supposed contract, 
  the State and this Sovereign Man? There was no consideration in the implied 
  contract for the same reasons that there was no consideration in the express 
  contract. </P>
  <P>44.&nbsp;&nbsp;An obligation is the thing to be done. It may be to pay 
  money, to do work, or to deliver goods; or it may be to refrain from doing 
  something that the person contracting had a RIGHT to do. Some may say that the 
  State was obligated to allow this Sovereign Man to drive on the streets or 
  highways in the united states of America and that this Sovereign Man was 
  obligated to obey all the statutes contained in the States' Statutes. It would 
  be just as easy to say that the State could not be obligated to allow this 
  Sovereign Man to travel on the streets or highways in the 50 united States of 
  America because they did not have the RIGHT or the power to prevent him from 
  doing so. </P>
  <P>45.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the State cannot prevent this Sovereign Man from 
  traveling on the streets or highways in 50 united States of America, they do 
  not have any discretion in the matter and do not have the choice of whether to 
  obligate themselves or not. Thus, the obligation of the State cannot be to 
  grant this Sovereign Man the privilege of traveling on the streets or highways 
  in the 50 united States of America. The obligation of the State cannot be to 
  refrain from prohibiting this Sovereign Man from traveling on the streets or 
  highways in the 50 united states of America since the State did not have the 
  RIGHT to do this at first. </P>
  <P>46.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the contention of this Sovereign Man that the only 
  obligation that this Sovereign Man incurs when using a vehicle upon the 
  streets or highways in the united states of America is the Common Law 
  obligation to refrain from any act that causes another person to lose life, 
  liberty, or property. In complying with this obligation, this Sovereign Man 
  does comply with many statutes in the union of States' Statutes since they 
  are, for the most part, only common sense rules by which this Sovereign Man 
  avoids doing damage to others. </P>
  <P>47.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, this acquiescence to some Statutes should not be 
  construed as evidence of a contractual obligation by this Sovereign Man. 
  Neither should it be construed as acquiescence to all the statutes or to any 
  of them always. Instead, it is merely evidence of a want of this Sovereign Man 
  to travel safely and to do harm to no one. </P>
  <P>48.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the actions of this Sovereign Man do not supply 
  unambiguous evidence of a contract with the State. Instead, the actions can, 
  with equal weight, be said to be evidence of the fact that this Sovereign Man 
  was complying with Common Law requirement that he does harm to no one. The 
  driver's license is not an implied contract because there is no consideration, 
  there may be possibly be two parties, but there is no consideration, and there 
  is not clear evidence of an obligation. Three of the four elements necessary 
  for a contract are missing. </P>
  <P>49.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now becomes whether the driver's license 
  application is a contract. In completing this document, the applicant makes 
  several statements and signs the paper upon which these statements are written 
  under oath. The statements concern the identity, physical description, 
  address, ability and experience in driving a vehicle, and one statement on the 
  physical condition of the applicant. None of the statements are as an 
  agreement. </P>
  <P>50.&nbsp;&nbsp;The application form contains the signature of the applicant 
  and the signature of the person taking the oath of the applicant. The reverse 
  side of the application contains the results of a vision test and rudimentary 
  physical examination with the results of a driving test. These results are 
  signed by the examiner and not by the applicant. </P>
  <P>51.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the application takes the form of an affidavit instead 
  of a contract. But let us see if the elements of a contract are present in the 
  application. </P>
  <P>51.1&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no agreement. </P>
  <P>51.2&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not two parties. </P>
  <P>51.3&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no consideration. </P>
  <P>51.4&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no obligation. </P>
  <P>52.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since none of the necessary elements of a contract are 
  present, the application does not constitute a contract. </P>
  <P>53.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only document involved in obtaining a driver's license 
  is the document, part of which is copied to make the actual driver's license. 
  It contains, besides the information that is used in making the driver's 
  license, the results of a vision test conducted by the driver's license 
  examiner. </P>
  <P>54.&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant places his signature upon this form that is 
  then copied by some photographic process. Other material is added including a 
  photograph, signature of the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles/Law 
  Enforcement and the driver's license is made of this composite. </P>
  <P>55.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the license itself cannot be a contract because it is a 
  contrived document. The form from which the driver's license is made cannot be 
  a contract because, again, none of the elements of a contract are present. So 
  if none of the documents executed by the driver when obtaining a license is a 
  contract, then no contract can exist between the driver and the State as a 
  result of obtaining a driver's license. </P>
  <P>56.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the idea that the driver's license is a contract with 
  the State is pervasive. It is a belief that is strongly held even by people in 
  high places. So let us examine the driver's license as if it were a contract 
  and see if it can withstand scrutiny. Not every offer made by one party and 
  accepted by the other creates a valid contract. The outward form of a 
  contract, either oral or written may exist, and yet the circumstances may be 
  such that no contract was in reality created. Some circumstances that will 
  cause an apparently valid contract to be void are: </P>
  <P>57. </P>
  <CENTER>
  <P>MISTAKE EITHER MUTUAL OR UNILATERAL </P></CENTER>
  <P>57.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Mistake either mutual or unilateral. </P>
  <P>57.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Fraud. </P>
  <P>57.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Duress. </P>
  <P>57.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Alteration. </P>
  <P>58.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Sovereign Man obtained a driver's license upon the 
  representation by the State that traveling upon the streets or highways of the 
  United States of America was a privilege. This Sovereign Man accepted this 
  representation as true and did obtain a driver's license. </P>
  <P>58.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a21 rel=nofollow>It has been shown, still, that 
  traveling is a "RIGHT" and not a privilege. Thus, a mutual mistake has been 
  made, and the "contract" is void. See: Deibel v. Kreiss, 50 N.E. 2d 1000 
  (1943).</A> </P>
  <P>59.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the legislative bodies of the States who passed the 
  statutes contained in the union of States' Statutes are knowledgeable people, 
  many of whom are lawyers, and they undoubtedly knew at the time the law was 
  passed that traveling was a RIGHT and not a privilege. If this were the case, 
  then the mistake would be unilateral. A unilateral mistake known to the other 
  party is sufficient grounds to void a contract. </P>
  <P>60. </P>
  <CENTER>
  <P>FRAUD </P></CENTER>
  <P>60.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a36 rel=nofollow>Fraud may consist in conduct, and 
  may exist where there are no positive representations, Silence where honesty 
  requires speech, may sometimes constitute fraud. The rule that a man may be 
  silent and safe is by no means a universal one. Where one contracting party 
  knows that the other is bargaining for one thing, he has no RIGHT by silence 
  to deceive him and suffer him to take an altogether different thing, from that 
  for which he bargains. (Emphasis added). See: Parish v. Thurston 87 Ind. 437 
  (1882). </A></P>
  <P>61.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the driver's license is a contract, a case can be made 
  for the contention that it was an agreement obtained by the State by fraud. 
  </P>
  <P>61.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a45 rel=nofollow>Fraud is a generic term which 
  embraces all the multifarious means which human ingenuity can devise and are 
  resorted to by one individual to get any advantage over another. No definite 
  and invariable rule can be laid down as a general proposition defining fraud, 
  as it includes all surprise, trick, cunning, dissembling, and unfair ways by 
  which another is deceived. See: Wells v. Zenz, 236 P. 485.</A> </P>
  <P>62.&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to contracts, the following statements can be 
  made: </P>
  <P>62.1&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the field of contracts, there are certain 
  standard tests for a claim of fraud which make it possible to define fraud, in 
  connection with a contract as any trick or artifice whereby a person by means 
  of a material misrepresentation creates an erroneous impression of the subject 
  matter of a proposed transaction, and thereby induces another person to suffer 
  damage computable in money. The misrepresentation may result from a false 
  statement, a concealment, or a nondisclosure. The elements of a contractual 
  fraud are the following: </P>
  <P>62.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;A material misrepresentation, created by a statement, a 
  concealment, or a nondisclosure. </P>
  <P>62.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;An intention to defraud. </P>
  <P>62.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Reliance on the representation by the defrauded party. 
  </P>
  <P>62.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage caused to the defrauded party as the result of his 
  acting upon the representation. See: Bergh Business Law p. 56 </P>
  <P>63.&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the many decisions by high courts, including the 
  Supreme Court of the United States, that traveling is a RIGHT and not a 
  privilege, it would be hard to defend the proposition that the legislative 
  bodies of the States were unaware of these decisions, particularly since many 
  legislators are and were lawyers knowledgeable in such matters. In fact, when 
  one considers the definition of streets or highways in Sections of the 
  Statutes, the Evidence is conclusive that the legislature knew and knows that 
  traveling is a "RIGHT." </P>
  <P>64.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the statements in the Statutes that traveling is 
  a privilege and that a driver's license is necessary before traveling 
  constitutes a material misrepresentation of fact to this possessor of a 
  driver's license. And since the legislature is and was aware of the fact that 
  traveling was not a privilege, but a "RIGHT," the statement that traveling is 
  a privilege, when applied to this Sovereign Man, constitutes a willful 
  intention to deceive and, therefore, to defraud. </P>
  <P>65.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Sovereign Man did rely upon the representations of the 
  legislature that traveling was a privilege when he obtained his driver's 
  license, else he would not have obtained one. </P>
  <P>66.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Sovereign Man did suffer damage as a result of his 
  acting upon the representation of the legislature at least to the extent of 
  the license fee. </P>
  <P>67.&nbsp;&nbsp;In as much as all the necessary elements of fraud are 
  present if the driver's license is considered a contract, the "contract" is 
  void. </P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <CENTER>
  <P>DURESS </P></CENTER>
  <P>68.&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to duress, Bergh supra supplies the following 
  definition: </P>
  <P>68.1&nbsp;&nbsp;A party must consent to a contract of his own free will; 
  free consent is an essential element of an agreement. Consequently, if he is 
  coerced into signing a contract by fear induced by a threat to cause personal 
  injury to himself or to some close relative, the contract will not be a real 
  agreement and it will be voidable at his option. The threat of personal injury 
  must be a threat to inflict immediate bodily injury or to institute a criminal 
  prosecution against the person threatened or some close relative. </P>
  <P>69.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it was essential to this Sovereign Man in pursuing his 
  occupation of common RIGHT to use a vehicle upon the streets or highways in 
  the 50 united States of America, and since the States threaten to and do 
  prosecute people in criminal actions for not possessing a driver's license, 
  regardless of their status, this Sovereign Man did obtain a driver's license 
  under duress. If then the driver's license is a contract, the contract is 
  unenforceable and invalid because of this duress. </P>
  <P>70.&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to alterations, Bergh supra has the following 
  comments: </P>
  <P>70.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Any material alteration in a written contract by one party 
  without the consent of the other party gives this latter the option of 
  treating the contract as discharged or enforcing it as it stood before the 
  alteration. </P>
  <P>71.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the driver's license is a contract, it is a written 
  contract, at least to the extent that the Statutes are written. Each time that 
  the legislature amends or modifies or adds to any of the statutes of the union 
  of States, the terms of the contract are changed. Since this Sovereign Man 
  then has the option of considering the contract as discharged, he then chooses 
  to do so as of the first change in the union of States' Statutes following his 
  application for a driver's license. </P>
  <P>72.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is contended that the driver's license is an implied 
  contract, the Statute of Frauds comes into play. The States have enacted a 
  Statute of Frauds. </P>
  <P>73.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following cases the agreement is invalid, unless the 
  same or some note or memorandum of it, be in writing and subscribed by the 
  party charged, or by his agent. Evidence, therefore, of the agreement cannot 
  be received without the writing or secondary evidence of its contents: </P>
  <P>73.1&nbsp;&nbsp;An agreement that by its terms is not to be performed 
  within a year from the making thereof. </P>
  <P>73.2&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . . . . </P>
  <P>74.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the term of the driver's license contract is so many 
  years and the contract is not written, the Statute of Frauds does apply and 
  the contract is unenforceable. </P>
  <P>75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussion up to this point has been concerned with 
  bilateral contracts in which each party promises something to the other party. 
  Is it possible that the driver's license is a unilateral contract? A 
  unilateral contract is described as: </P>
  <P>75.1&nbsp;&nbsp;A unilateral contract is a one-sided contract in the sense 
  that only one side makes a promise, and the other side performs an act for 
  which the promise was given. See: Bergh supra. </P>
  <P>76.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the act expected by the State is obedience to the 
  statutes of the union of States' Statutes, what promise has the State offered 
  in exchange for this act? The only promise that the State could make this 
  Sovereign Man is the promise to allow him to travel on the streets or highways 
  in the 50 united States of America. Since this Sovereign Man already can do 
  that as a matter of RIGHT, the State can promise him nothing. Thus there is no 
  consideration and a unilateral contract cannot exist. </P>
  <P>77.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having shown that no contract exists between this Sovereign 
  Man and the State, let us examine the proposition that a quasi-contract exists 
  between this Sovereign Man and the State. </P>
  <P>78. </P>
  <CENTER>
  <P>QUASI-CONTRACT </P></CENTER>
  <P>78.1&nbsp;&nbsp;A quasi-contract is an obligation springing from voluntary 
  and lawful acts of parties in the absence of any agreement. See: Bouvier's Law 
  Dictionary. </P>
  <P>79.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to establish the existence of a quasi-contractual 
  obligation it must be shown: </P>
  <P>79.1&nbsp;&nbsp;That the defendant has received a benefit from the 
  plaintiff. </P>
  <P>79.2&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a50 rel=nofollow>That the retention of the benefit 
  by the defendant is inequitable. See: Woodward Quasi Contracts 9.</A> </P>
  <P>80.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, if it is contended that this Sovereign Man must obey 
  the statutes in the union of States' Statutes because of a quasi-contract, it 
  must be shown that this Sovereign Man has received a benefit from the State. 
  But traveling on the streets or highways in the State is not a benefit 
  received from the State. It was a RIGHT that attached to this Sovereign Man at 
  the moment of his birth and cannot be removed by the State. In this respect, 
  no benefit has been received from the State, and thus a quasi-contractual 
  obligation cannot exist with respect to this Sovereign Man. </P>
  <P>81.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be claimed that the statutes are made pursuant to the 
  police powers of the State and that every person in the State is obligated to 
  obey them. </P>
  <P>82.&nbsp;&nbsp;The police power is a grant of authority from the people to 
  their governmental agents for the protection of the health, the safety, the 
  comfort and the welfare of the public. In its nature it is broad and 
  comprehensive. It is a necessary and salutary power, since without it, society 
  would be at the mercy of individual interest and there would exist neither 
  public order nor security. While this is true it is only a power. It is not a 
  "RIGHT?" </P>
  <P>83.&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers of government, under our system, are nowhere 
  absolute. They are but grants of authority from the people, and are limited to 
  their true purposes. The fundamental RIGHTS of the people are inherent and 
  have not yielded to governmental control. They are not the subjects of 
  governmental authority. They are subjects of individual authority. 
  Constitutional powers can never transcend constitutionally guaranteed RIGHTS. 
  The police power is subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution 
  upon every power of government; and it will not be suffered to invade or 
  impair the fundamental liberties of the Sovereign Man, those natural RIGHTS 
  that are the chief concern of the Constitution and for whose protection it was 
  ordained by the people. </P>
  <P>83.1&nbsp;&nbsp;To secure their property was one of the great ends for 
  which men entered into society. The RIGHT to acquire and own property, and to 
  deal with it and use it as the owner chooses, so long as the use harms nobody, 
  is a natural RIGHT. It does not owe its origin to constitutions. It existed 
  before them. It is a part of the Citizen's natural liberty--an expression of 
  his freedom, guaranteed as inviolate by every American Bill of RIGHTS. </P>
  <P>83.2&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a RIGHT, therefore, over which the police power 
  is paramount. Like every other fundamental liberty, it is a RIGHT to which the 
  police power is subordinate. </P>
  <P>83.3&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a RIGHT which takes into account the equal RIGHTS of 
  others, for it is qualified by the obligation that the use of the property 
  shall not be to the prejudice of others. But if subject alone to that 
  qualification the Citizen is not free to use his lands and his goods as he 
  chooses, it is difficult to perceive wherein his RIGHT of property has any 
  existence. (Emphasis added). See: Spann supra. </P>
  <P>84.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where inherent, unalienable, absolute RIGHTS are concerned, 
  the police powers can have no effect. The RIGHT to travel on the streets or 
  highways and the RIGHT to own and use property have been described as 
  inherent, unalienable, and absolute. Thus the police power cannot regulate 
  this Sovereign Man's RIGHT to use a vehicle on the streets or highways in the 
  50 united States of America. </P>
  <P>85.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the police power of the State is permitted to regulate 
  the traveling of this Sovereign Man on the streets or highways in the 50 
  united States of America and if through the action of these regulations or 
  statutes, this Sovereign Man is denied access to the streets or highways in 
  the 50 united States of America, a fundamental RIGHT of this Sovereign Man has 
  been abrogated. If this is allowed to happen in this country (and it has), 
  then this is not the "Land of the free and the home of the brave," but is in 
  fact a socialistic state. </P>
  <P>85.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a31 rel=nofollow>Where RIGHTS secured by the 
  Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation that 
  would abrogate them. (Emphasis added). See: Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 
  491 (1966).</A> </P>
  <P>86.&nbsp;&nbsp;The abrogation of unalienable RIGHTS by legislation or rule 
  making is unconstitutional. </P>
  <P>87.&nbsp;&nbsp;If further proof is needed to show that this Sovereign Man 
  need not be licensed to travel on the streets or highways in the 50 united 
  States of America, it is provided in the following decisions: </P>
  <P>87.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a35 rel=nofollow>A license fee is a tax. See: 
  Parish of Morehouse v. Brigham, 6 S. 257.</A> </P>
  <P>87.2&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a32 rel=nofollow>A state may not impose a charge 
  for the enjoyment of a RIGHT granted by the Federal Constitution. (Emphasis 
  added). (However, rights are not granted by any piece of paper, only 
  privileges). See: Murdock v. Pennsylvania 319 U.S. 105.</A> </P>
  <P>88.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since a fee is charged for a driver's license and since 
  traveling on the streets or highways in the 50 united States of America is a 
  RIGHT guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, and by the LAW OF NATURE, it is 
  not constitutional for the State to require this Sovereign Man to be licensed 
  to travel. </P>
  <P>89.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the application for a Driver's License form recognizes 
  the RIGHT of some people to travel without a license. The union of States' 
  Statutes recognizes categories of peoples who are not required to be licensed 
  in the State. Why is it then that the first demand made by the law enforcement 
  personnel when making a traffic stop is: "Let's see your driver's license, 
  registration, and proof of insurance," and not always politely, when the first 
  question should be; "What is your status and are you required to have a 
  driver's license?" </P>
  <P>90.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can it be that there is a conspiracy afoot within the States 
  to reduce all Sovereign Men to a status of contract? Why else would a law 
  enforcement officer/person take a traveler to jail without even trying to 
  discover if that man or woman was exempt from the requirement of having a 
  driver's license? </P>
  <P>91.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now becomes whether this Sovereign Man is 
  required to obey any of the statutes in the union of States' Statutes. It has 
  been shown that this Sovereign Man has a RIGHT to travel on the streets or 
  highways in the united States of America. So, any statute that describes 
  driving on the streets or highways as a privilege cannot apply to this 
  Sovereign Man. Since the RIGHT of this Sovereign Man to travel cannot be 
  abrogated, any statute the operation of which would have the effect of denying 
  access to the streets or highways to this Sovereign Man cannot apply to this 
  Sovereign Man. </P>
  <P>92.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since violation of any statue in the Statutes is classified 
  as a misdemeanor that is punishable by a fine and six months in jail, and 
  since putting this Sovereign Man in jail because of his use of the streets or 
  highways that harms nobody would be an abrogation of his RIGHT to travel, none 
  of the statutes of the union of States' Statutes apply to this Sovereign Man. 
  These contentions are supported by the Supreme Court of United States. </P>
  <P>92.1&nbsp;&nbsp;An Iowa statute that requires that every foreign 
  corporation named in it shall as a condition for obtaining a permit to 
  transact business in Iowa, stipulate that it will not remove into the federal 
  court certain suits that it would by the laws of the United States have a 
  RIGHT to remove, is void because it makes the RIGHT to a permit dependent upon 
  the surrender by the foreign corporation of a privilege secured to it by the 
  constitution and laws of the United States. (Emphasis added). See: Bouvier's 
  Law Dictionary quoting Barron v. Burnside, 121 U.S. 186. </P>
  <P>93.&nbsp;&nbsp;This decision is consistent with that in Miranda, supra in 
  which it was stated that where RIGHTS are concerned, there can be no rule 
  making or legislation that would abrogate them. It is also consistent with the 
  discussion in the following case. This case is a tax case but the discussion 
  on RIGHTS that it contains is appropriate. </P>
  <P>94. </P>
  <CENTER>
  <P>INDIVIDUAL AND A CORPORATION </P></CENTER>
  <P>94.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a25 rel=nofollow>There is a clear distinction in 
  this particular between an individual and a corporation, and that the latter 
  has no RIGHT to refuse to submit its books and papers for an examination at 
  the suit of the State. The individual may stand upon his constitutional RIGHTS 
  as a Citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. 
  His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no duty to the State or to his 
  neighbors to divulge his business, or to open his doors to an investigation so 
  far as it may tend to incriminate him. He owes no such duty to the State, 
  since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond the protection of his life and 
  property. His RIGHTS are such as existed by the law of the land long 
  antecedent to the organization of the State, and can only be taken from him by 
  due process of law, and in accordance with the Constitution. Among his RIGHTS 
  are a refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his 
  property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law. He owes 
  nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their RIGHTS. 
  (Emphasis added.) See: Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43. </A></P>
  <P>95.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emphasized statement is also consistent with common law 
  of England, as far as it is not repugnant to or inconsistent with the 
  Constitution or laws of the United States in all cases not provided for in 
  these compiled laws, is the rule of decision in all courts in the states. 
  Since the statutes of the 50 united States of America cannot apply to this 
  Sovereign Man, he becomes subject to the Common Law that maintains that he 
  owes nothing to the public while he does not trespass upon their RIGHTS. </P>
  <P>96.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the contention of this Sovereign Man that because the 
  statutes contained in the union of States' Statutes do not apply to him that 
  the statutes are unconstitutional? Absolutely not. There is a class of persons 
  in the 50 united States of America to whom these statutes apply without 
  reservation. Members of this class include corporations and those who do the 
  corporation business, i.e., Motor Carriers, taxies, buses, etc., on the 
  streets or highways in the 50 united States of America. A corporation is the 
  creation of the State. </P>
  <P>96.1&nbsp;&nbsp;A corporation is a creature of the State. It is presumed to 
  be incorporated for the benefit of the public. It receives certain special 
  privileges and franchises and holds them, subject to the laws of the State and 
  the limitations of its charter. Its RIGHTS to act as a corporation are only 
  preserved to it while it obeys the laws of its creation. (Emphasis added). 
  See: Bouvier's Law Dictionary, 1914 p. 684 </P>
  <P>97.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a person in the eyes of the law, but it lacks 
  character, morals, conscience and a soul. It's every activity must be directed 
  and supervised by the State. Under the definition of Due Process of Law, 
  Bouvier's Law Dictionary states in part: </P>
  <P>97.1&nbsp;&nbsp; <A name=a46 rel=nofollow>The liberty guaranteed is that of 
  a natural person and not of artificial persons; Western Turf Assn. v. 
  Greenberg, 204 U.S. 359 where it was said "a corporation cannot be deemed a 
  Citizen within the meaning of the clause of the Constitution of the United 
  States which protects the privileges and immunities of Citizens of the United 
  States against being abridged or impaired by the law of a state." See also 203 
  U.S. 243.</A> </P>
  <P>98.&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutes in the union of States are designed to direct 
  the activities of the class of persons of which a corporation is a member. 
  Corporations are absolutely bound by these statutes. It is imperative that a 
  conscienceless entity not be allowed to roam the streets or highways in the 50 
  united States of America and jeopardize the Sovereign Man. It is for this 
  purpose that the statutes of the 50 united States of America were enacted and 
  not for the control of a Free and Natural Sovereign Man. </P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>

  <P>CONCLUSION </P></CENTER>
  <P>99.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no Court in This Land that could Lawfully execute 
  an Order that would or could cause, or work to compel, One to become a servant 
  or slave of any city, county or state without a conviction and with full due 
  process of law, and for any city, county or state to pretend otherwise is an 
  absurdity. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
