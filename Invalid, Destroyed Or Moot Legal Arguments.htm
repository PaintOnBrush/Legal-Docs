    <TD>I. The <A name="Money" id="Money">Money</A> Issue: 
      <P>In the seventies and early eighties, advocates of the specie provisions 
      in Art. 1, §10, cl. 1 of the U.S. Constitution made a concerted effort to 
      educate people about this constitutional provision, consequently people 
      (mostly those who were deperate and ill-prepared) acting pro se began
       litigating the issue. The courts have rendered the following adverse 
      decisions on this issue:</P>

      <P>II. <A name="Wages" id="Wages">Wages</A> Are Not Income:</P>
      <P>Back in about 1979 or 1980, Bob Golden and Pete Soehnlen published a 
      work entitled <EM>Are You Required</EM>, which persuasively advocated the 
      argument that wages are not income. However, desperate people championed 
      this issue and lost in the following cases:</P>
      <P>1. <EM>United States v. Romero</EM>, 640 F.2d 1014 (9th Cir. 1981)<BR>
      2. <EM>Lonsdale v. CIR</EM>, 661 F.2d 71 (5th Cir. 1981)(rejecting "even 
      exchange" argument)<BR>3. <EM>United States v. Lawson</EM>, 670 F.2d 923 
      (10th Cir. 1982)<BR>4. <EM>Granzow v. CIR</EM>, 739 F.2d 265 (7th Cir. 
      1984)<BR>5. <EM>Hansen v. United States</EM>, 744 F.2d 658 (8th Cir.
       1984)<BR>6. <EM>Perkins v. CIR</EM>, 746 F.2d 1187 (6th Cir. 1984)<BR>7. 
      <EM>Schiff v. CIR</EM>, 751 F.2d 116 (2nd Cir. 1984)<BR>8. <EM>Ficalora v. 
      CIR</EM>, 751 F.2d 85, 87-88 (2d Cir. 1984) (holding that income includes 
      compensation for services)<BR>9. <EM>Lovell v. United States</EM>, 755 
      F.2d 517, 519 (7th Cir. 1984)<BR>10. <EM>United States v. Latham</EM>, 754 
      F.2d 747 (7th Cir. 1985)<BR>11. <EM>Hyslep v. United States</EM>, 765 F.2d 
      1083 (11th Cir. 1985)<BR>12. <EM>Coleman v. CIR</EM>, 791 F.2d 68, 70 (7th 
      Cir. 1986)<BR><EM>13. Stubbs v. Commissioner of IRS</EM>, 797 F.2d 936, 
      938 (11th Cir. 1986) (rejecting argument that wages are not taxable income 
      as "patently frivolous")<BR>14. <EM>Wilcox v. CIR</EM>, 848 F.2d 1007, 
      1008 (9th Cir. 1988)<BR>15. <EM>Maisano v. United States</EM>, 908 F.2d 
      408, 409 (9th Cir. 1990), and <EM>Maisano v. United States</EM>, 940 F.2d 
      499, 501-02 (9th Cir. 1991)<BR>16. <EM>United States v. Gerards</EM>, 999 
      F.2d 1255, 1256 (8th Cir. 1993).</P>
      <P>Jeff Dickstein, lawyer "extraordinare" from California, later Alaska, 
      Montana, Tennessee and now Oklahoma, has written a book entitled 
      <EM>Judicial Tyranny,</EM> which discusses this issue in great detail, 
      including all the adverse decisions on this issue through 1989. When Jeff 
      and I were about to start the conspiracy trial of Vern Holland and Dave
       Mauldin in Tulsa in August, 1990, Jeff announced that his book was hot 
      off the press. When we got the first copy and looked at his book just days 
      before we were to start that trial in federal court in Tulsa, we noticed 
      that the front cover contained the seal of the local federal court as well 
      as a likeness of one of the local federal judges. At times, Jeff can be 
      harrowing. However, we got a hung jury in that case and afterwards, 6 of 
      the jurors, including the forelady, came and joined Vern's patriot
       organization.</P>
      <P><A href="http://caught.net/prose/deadissu.htm#Top">Return To

      <P>III. The IRS is a <A name="Delaware" id="Delaware">Delaware</A> 
      corporation:</P>
      <P>Back in 1982 or 1983, somebody started circulating the argument that 
      the IRS was a private corporation which had been created in Delaware in 
      1933. If it was created only in 1933, then why do we have the following
       appropriations for this agency found in acts of Congress a decade before 
      1933:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>42 Stat. 375 (2-17-22); 42 Stat. 454 (3-20-22); 42 
      Stat. 1096 (1-3-23); 43 Stat. 71 (4-4-24); 43 Stat. 693 (12-5-24); 43 
      Stat. 757 (1-20-25); 43 Stat. 770 (1-22-25); 44 Stat. 142 (3-2-26); 44
       Stat. 868 (7-3-26); 44 Stat. 1033 (1-26-27); 45 Stat. 168, 1034 (1928); 
      68 Stat. 86, 145, 807 (1954).</P>
      <P>This is indeed a frivolous argument and has properly been rejected by 
      the courts; see <EM>Young v. IRS</EM>, 596 F.Supp. 141, 147 (N.D. Ind. 
      1984). The real issue is whether the IRS has been created by law.</P>
      <P><A href="http://caught.net/prose/deadissu.htm#Top">Return To
 Top</A></P>
      <P>&nbsp;IV. The <A name="IMF" id="IMF">IMF</A> Argument:</P>
      <P>Some contend that the Secretary of the Treasury is in reality a foreign 
      agent under the control of the IMF; the argument has been rejected by the
       courts.</P>
      <P>1. <EM>United States v. Rosnow</EM>, 977 F.2d 399, 413 (8th Cir. 
      1992)<BR>2. <EM>United States v. Jagim</EM>, 978 F.2d 1032, 1036 (8th Cir.
       1992)<BR>3. <EM>United States v. Higgins</EM>, 987 F.2d 543, 545 (8th 
      Cir. 1993).</P>
      <P><A href="http://caught.net/prose/deadissu.htm#Top">Return To
 Top</A></P>
      <P>V. Non-resident <A name="Aliens" id="Aliens">Aliens</A>:</P>
      <P>Some contend we are for tax purposes non-resident aliens; again, this 
      improper argument has been correctly rejected by the courts.</P>
      <P>1. <EM>United States v. Sloan</EM>, 939 F.2d 499, 501 (7th Cir. 
      1991)<BR>2. <EM>United States v. Jagim</EM>, 978 F.2d 1032, 1036 (8th Cir.
       1992)<BR>3. <EM>United States v. Hilgeford</EM>, 7 F.3d 1340, 1342 (7th 
      Cir. 1993)<BR>4. <EM>United States v. Mundt</EM>, 29 F.3d 233 (6th Cir. 
      1994) ("federal zone" case)<BR>5. <EM>Larue v. United States</EM>, 959 
      F.Supp. 957 (C.D.Ill. 1997).</P>
      <P>But the rejection by the courts of this issue has not deterred Lynn 
      Meredith, who has continued to promote this argument through her book, 
      <EM>Vultures in Eagles Clothing</EM>, via a multi-level sales scheme. 
      Lawyers know that fraud is a knowing misrepresentation of facts (or in 
      this case, law) to another upon which that other party relies to his

      contention violated many principles of real property and when Carol

      <P>According to a book written by Berkheimer, a "nom de guerre" is a war 
      name symbolized by a given name being written in capital letters. The 
      argument contends that because of events in 1933, we have been made 
      "enemies" and government indicates our status as enemies by the nom de 
      guerre. If this is true, then why have the styles of the decisions of the
       United States Supreme Court since its establishment been in caps? This 
      argument has gotten lots of people in trouble. For example, Mike Kemp of 
      the Gadsden Militia defended himself on state marijuana charges with this 
      argument and he was thrown into jail. I have not even seen a decent brief 
      on this issue which was predicated upon cases you can find in an ordinary 
      law library. In any event, at least one case has rejected this argument; 
      see <EM>United States v. Klimek</EM>, 952 F.Supp. 1100 (E.D.Pa. 1997).</P>

      single page motion which in essence stated that he could not be prosecuted 
      because he was not a 14th amendment citizen. Naturally, such a 
      non-substantive motion was denied. Cheek's appeal would have involved this 
      argument if he had reached the conclusion that it had merit. However, the

      <P>Caught received this from John B. Sims III in florida:</P>
      <P>My research shows the following in Florida: ...the issue before this 
      court is simply whether the express requirements of the Florida Rules of 
      Civil Procedure, namely R. 1.110(c) and R. 1.110(e), apply with equal 
      force and effect to a pro se litigant who prepares an answer to a 
      complaint. This district has already determined that they do. Kohn v. City 
      of Miami Beach, 611 So.2d 538 (Fla. 3d DCA 1992)(finding no error in
       dismissing pro se's complaint with prejudice after four amendments; pro 
      se litigant should not be treated differently from litigant represented by 
      counsel); Carr v. Grace, 321 So.2d 618, 618 (Fla. 3d DCA 
      1975)("Appellant's self representation does not relieve her of the 
      obligation to comply with any appropriate rules of the court and the rules 
      of civil procedure."), cert. denied, 348 So.2d 945 (Fla. 1977); see also § 
      454.18, Fla. Stat. (1993)("Any person . . . may conduct his own cause in 
      any court of this state . . . subject to the lawful rules and discipline 
      of such court . . . ."). While the majority cites to authority which in 
      dicta says that pro se pleadings are to be liberally construed to effect 
      justice, see, e.g., Tillman v. State, 287 So.2d 693, 694 (Fla. 2d DCA), 
      cert. dismissed, 285 So.2d 417 (Fla. 1973) and cert. dismissed, 285 So.2d
       617 (Fla. 1973) and Thomas v. State, 164 So.2d 857, 857 n.1 (Fla. 2d DCA 
      1964), this authority does not purport to exempt pro se litigants from our 
      established rules of procedure and court.</P>
      <P>A trial judge hearing a contested matter involving self-represented 
      parties is placed in the ethical quandary of attempting to ensure that 
      each pro se litigant is not disadvantaged because of his or her lack of 
      knowledge of the law and procedure and, at the same time, serving as the 
      neutral decision-maker in an adversarial system.3 See, generally, Bruce D.
       Sales, Connie J. Beck &amp; Richard K. Haan, Is Self-Representation a 
      Reasonable Alternative to Attorney Representation in Divorce Cases?, 37 
      St. Louis U.L.J. 553 (1993). 666 So. 2d 1030, 21 Fla. Law W. D, 261&nbsp; 
      ROBINSON v. ROBINSON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Dist. Ct. App. 1st Dist. 1996)</P>
      <P>When such a restraint is issued, (prohibition from appearing pro se) 
      notice and hearing is usually required. In Platel v. Maguire, Voorhis 
      &amp; Wells, P.A., 436 So.2d 303 (Fla. 5th DCA), rev. denied, 440 So.2d 
      353 (Fla. 1983), the Fifth District Court of Appeal issued a restraining 
      order against a pro se litigant who had abused his pro se right of access
       to the court and interfered with the effective administration of justice 
      but it did not issue the order until after the pro se litigant was given 
      an opportunity to show cause why he should not be prohibited from 
      appearing pro se as an appellant or petitioner.627 So. 2d 1298, 18 Fla. 
      Law W. D, 2631&nbsp; MARTIN v. CIRCUIT 
      COURT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Dist. Ct. 
      App. 4th Dist. 1993)</P>
      <P>Where a pro se litigant does not abide by the court's orders, it is 
      logical that he or she should suffer the consequences. 624 So. 2d 765, 18 
      Fla. Law W. D, 2006&nbsp; LAHTI v. PORN&nbsp; (Dist. Ct. App. 4th Dist.
       1993)</P>
      <P>At the trial level, the court is not obliged to grant every request for 
      self-representation. There are instances in which acquiescence in such 
      requests is likely to result in manifest injustice. Williams v. State, 
      supra; Capetta v. State, 204 So.2d 913 (Fla. 4th DCA 1967), rev'd in part, 
      216 So.2d 749 (Fla. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 1008 (1969). Similarly,
       appellate courts considering requests for self-representation take into 
      account the likelihood of injustice to or intransigence by the pro se 
      litigant. See, e.g., Blanton v. State, 561 So.2d 587 (Fla. 2d DCA 
      1989).</P>
      <P>We conclude that it is a mistake to hold a pro se litigant to a lesser 
      standard than a reasonably competent attorney. Section 454.18, Florida 
      Statutes (1991) clearly provides "any person . . . may conduct his own 
      cause in any court of this state . . . subject to the lawful rules and 
      discipline of such court." Likewise, in Carr v. Grace, 321 So.2d 618 (Fla. 
      3d DCA 1975), cert. denied, 348 So.2d 945 (1977), we observed a party's
       self-representation does not relieve the party of the obligation to
       comply with any appropriate rules of civil procedure.1&nbsp; Application 
      of any lesser standard can only foment litigation by encouraging a 
      litigant to act pro se and, when his seeming ability to plead a cause of 
      action fails, to then engage an attorney to start again. Moreover, there 
      is no reason to set lower standards for pro se litigants in the Eleventh 
      Judicial Circuit since there is in place an ongoing program purposely 
      designed to make qualified members of the bar available to litigants who 
      qualify for their services.2&nbsp; Compassion for a pro se litigant and 
      justice under law are entirely different concepts that should not be 
      confused. Further, we should avoid the temptation to require governmental
       entities to defend because they seemingly have an inexhaustible supply of 
      legal talent available. To do so would penalize the public who ultimately 
      pays the bill. 611 So. 2d 538, 17 Fla. Law W. D, 2745&nbsp; KOHN v. CITY 
      OF MIAMI BEACH, et al., (Dist. Ct. App. 3rd Dist. 1992)</P>
