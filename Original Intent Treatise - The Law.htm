            <H2>The Law</H2></CENTER>[Editor's Note - <EM>This section is not 
            intended to give the reader the tools to fully understand the scope 
            and nature of the laws under which the states and the federal 
            government operate.  That goal takes years to achieve and I doubt 
            any single resource could make a significant contribution to that 
            end.  This section is intended as a "wake-up call" concerning the 
            idiosyncrasies and complexities of the law so that when you come in 
            contact with "law", you are not immediately overwhelmed, and that 
            you have some understanding of the issues you may be facing.</EM>] 
            <P>How would you define, "law"?  Most people have never really 
            stopped to consider this question.  For most Americans "law" is 
            something the police officer uses to make an arrest or issue a 
            traffic ticket.  To others it is a bunch of confusing books that 
            lawyers use to bamboozle you out of what is rightfully yours.  If 
            you hold these opinions, you are right - but you've barely scratched 
            the surface! 
            <P><B>"The Law" is any system (or part of that system) that creates 
            or recognizes rights, duties, or obligations, and provides a forum 
            through which to seek a remedy in the event that any of those 
            rights, duties, or obligations are breached.</B> 
            <P>Although one would ordinarily think that in the course of history 
            there have been many different forms of law, one would likely be 
            surprised, if not downright shocked, to learn how many different 
            forms of "law" exist in America at this very moment.  Here are but a 
            few of the styles of law that you may be called to operate within if 
            you find yourself head-to-head with the legal system:

            <P> As you can see, things can get challenging rather quickly.  Each 
            form of law has its own special doctrines and standards.  Many times 
            one form of law "nests" within another. Unless one understands the 
            idiosyncrasies of the type of law being used or applied in a certain 
            case, one will often feel railroaded toward an unpleasant outcome.  
            Although this website cannot possibly educate its visitors in every 
            area of the law, it is our goal to make you aware of the broad 
            concepts that govern the legal trade.  After that, it is you who 
            must do the work if you wish to better understand the Byzantine maze 
            that is our legal system. 
            <P>
            <CENTER>Fundamental Forms of American Law</CENTER>
            <P>In America, our laws are comprised of several fundamental levels. 
             The first is <B>Constitutional law</B>.  No other law, of any form, 
            is valid unless it comports itself with the applicable Constitution. 
             A law that cannot find its basis in the applicable Constitution is 
            an unconstitutional law, and thus null and void.  
            <P>At the state level, the next operative form of law is the 
            <B>common law</B>.  The government has done everything within its 
            power to wipe common-law from the face of America, but the common 
            law was, is, and always will be, the proper form of law for the 
            <EM>de jure</EM> state Citizen.  Some modern expositors have stated 
            that the common law is "harsh".  We might observe that it is 
            unforgiving and inflexible when a person transgresses the rights of 
            others.  We are not convinced that this makes the common-law harsh, 
            so much as it does strict. 
            <P>Next in significance is <B>Equity law</B>.  Equity law covers a 
            broad scope of legal issues and is used extensively in today's 
            courts.  Equity is distinct from common-law. 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Equity</B> - "...a system of jurisprudence 
              collateral to, and in some respects independent of, 
              'law'".<BR><EM>Black's Law Dictionary</EM>, 6th Ed. 
              <P><B>Equity Jurisdiction</B> - "That portion of remedial justice 
              which is exclusively administrated by courts of equity as 
              distinguished from courts of common law".<BR><EM>Black's Law 
              Dictionary</EM>, 6th Ed.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>And here is a fascinating definition, from Bouvier's Law 
            Dictionary [1856]: 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Equity, Court of</B> - A court of equity is one 
              which administers justice, where there are no legal 
            rights...</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>The most succinct (although not exhaustive) definition of 
            "Equity" would be this: 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>"The term 'equity' denotes the spirit and habit of 
              fairness, justness, and right dealing which would regulate the 
              intercourse of men with men"<BR><EM>Gilles v. Dept. of Human 
              Resources Development</EM>, 11 Cal.3d 313</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>It is important to note that whenever the word "fair" is 
            involved, it means that a third party will decide what is fair for 
            you.  Despite the lofty ideals of "equity", what is thought to be 
            "fair" in the mind of one person, may often times be thought 
            completely unfair in the mind of another.  If the common-law is 
            competent to provide a remedy, one need not acquiesce to the 
            jurisdiction of a court of equity.  
            <P>Next would come <B>statutory law</B>.  This is the form of law 
            that most Americans know as "the law", <U>although it is in reality 
            a form of law with <B><EM>very limited power</EM></B></U>.  
            Statutory law is comprised solely of the acts of the legislature 
            that have become law and are currently in force.  Most of these 
            legislative acts (statutes) have been codified to one "title" or 
            another within a set of "codes".  There are a couple of significant 
            points to remember.  First, most codes are not law, but are merely 
            indicative of the law; the law is the actual statute that was passed 
            by the legislature.  It is conceivable that a statute could have 
            been repealed, yet the code section still exist.  If you are in a 
            legal fight, always check the statute behind the code section.  
            Second, keep in mind that not every statute passed into law is 
            codified; some statutes simply stand-alone and remain non-codified, 
            hence the name "statute-at-large". 
            <P>And here's the real kicker concerning statutory law: 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE><B><EM>A statute is an enactment by a legislative body 
              bringing into existence its creatures (e.g. corporations) and 
              setting forth the privileges, immunities, and responsibilities of 
              each creation. A statute applies only to the "rightful subjects of 
              legislation" (i.e the creatures created by statutory fiat). The 
              phrase "rightful subjects of legislation" does not mean <U>The 
              People</U>, unless the statute specifically states its intent to 
              apply to private Citizens.</EM></B></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>Of course one should remember that one can create an obligation 
            to a law that would not otherwise bind him by involving himself in 
            various regulated activities or by entering into an agreement with 
            the government (such as acquiring a business license, resale permit, 
            etc.) 
            <P>
            <CENTER><B>Other Important Distinctions</B></CENTER>
            <P>
            <CENTER><U>Classifications</U></CENTER>
            <P>Every law that defines an offense falls into one of two 
            categories.  The first category is <EM>mala in se</EM>, and the 
            second is <EM>mala prohibita</EM>.   
            <P>A <EM>mala in se</EM> offense is a crime that is, by the laws of 
            nature and God, a true crime.  Examples of this would be, murder, 
            rape, robbery, fraud, etc. 
            <P>A <EM>mala prohibita</EM> offense is one that would not be an 
            offense were it not for the legislature passing a law that makes a 
            particular act a punishable offense.  Examples of this would be, 
            possessing or smoking marijuana, buying and selling more than 7 cars 
            a year without a dealer's license (in California), not obeying road 
            signs and speed limits, etc. 
            <P>
            <CENTER><U>Application</U></CENTER>
            <P>Various laws also only apply to certain "groups" of persons and 
            not persons outside that group or groups.  An example if this would 
            be laws concerning "licensed contractors".  The state has no blanket 
            authority to require every person who, for profit, plumbs, or 
            installs a lighting fixture, or builds a patio deck, to apply for 
            and acquire a license.   
            <P>Here is a list of the persons who must have a contractor's 
            license: 
            <P>
            <OL>
              <LI>Any person conducting certain defined types of construction on 
              State property. 
              <LI>Any person who has entered into a contract with the State to 
              perform certain defined types of construction. 
              <LI>Any person who has acquired a contractor's license and has not 
              properly cancelled it. 
              <LI>Any foreign corporation doing business in your State. </LI></OL>
            <P>
            <CENTER><U>Nature</U></CENTER>
            <P>All legal actions fall only within one of two broad categories; 
            <B>civil</B> or <B>criminal</B>. 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 24: 
              <P>Actions are of two kinds:  1. Civil; and, 2. 
            Criminal.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>The Penal Code of each state is the code from which crimes are 
            prosecuted.  In California, the Code of Civil Procedures states: 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>Section 31 - The Penal Code defines and provides for 
              the prosecution of a criminal action.</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>Please note that there is no criminal action that is prosecuted 
            from any other code. 
            <P>Civil actions arise out from either an <B>obligation</B>, or an 
            <B>injury</B>.  Here is how the California Code of Civil Procedures 
            defined those two terms: 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>Section 26 - An obligation is a legal duty, by which 
              one person is bound to do or not to do a certain thing, and arises 
              from:<BR>   One--Contract; or,<BR>   Two--Operation of 
            law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>An "injury" is defined thusly: 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>Section 27 - An injury is of two kinds:<BR>  	 1. To 
              the person; and,<BR>  	 2. To property.</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>An injury is fairly self-evident, as is an obligation connected 
            with a contract.  However, the obligation that arises from an 
            "operation of law" may seem less clear. 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Operation of law</B> - This term expresses the 
              manner in which rights, and sometimes liabilities, devolve upon a 
              person by the application to the particular transaction of the 
              established rule of law, without the act or co-operation of the 
              party himself.<BR><EM>Black's Law Dictionary</EM>, 6th 
            Ed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>In other words, an operation of law is simply some event or 
            circumstance that lays a right or liability upon a person through no 
            action of his own, and that right or liability may justify a civil 
            court action.     
            <P>[Editor's Note: <EM>We frequently use California law because we 
            are most familiar with it. However the concepts discussed are 
            general in nature, and apply in your state as well as

            <CENTER>How Federal Law Differs from State Law</CENTER>
            <P>Federal law only defines <EM>mala in se</EM> crimes that occur 
            within the "federal places".  [See the <A href="http://www.originalintent.org/edu/territory.php">federal 
            territorial jurisdiction</A> section of this site for more details 
            on geographic jurisdiction of the US.]   In other words, federal law 
            cannot define "murder", as such term may be used within, 
            say...Arizona.  That's because the federal government has no general 
            police powers within the states of the Union.  The federal 
            government may only define a <EM>mala in se</EM> crime for use 
            within places that are under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction 
            of Congress.  Compared to a state penal code, there are relatively 
            few <EM>mala in se</EM> crimes defined with the United State's 
            equivalent of a penal code [Title 18 of the United States Code].  
            Most "crimes" that are contained in 18 USC are actually regulatory 
            in nature [<EM>mala prohibita</EM>]. 
            <P>When dealing with federal law, the trick is to determine (through 
            research) what is the exact nature and authority of the law being 
            examined.  It will fall into one of three categories: 
            <P>
            <OL>
              <LI>A true criminal statute [<EM>mala in se</EM>] that applies to 
              persons and property located within the geographic United States 
              (i.e. Washington DC, other federal lands, US possessions and 
              territories). 
              <LI>A regulatory law [<EM>mala prohibita</EM>] that applies to 
              persons and property located within the geographic United States 
              (i.e. Washington DC, other federal lands, US possessions and 
              territories), and/or to those who have entered into a licensed 
              activity under the authority of the United States. 
              <LI>A regulatory law [<EM>mala prohibita</EM>] that applies to 
              persons and property located within the states of the Union under 
              the enumerated powers of the federal government, which are 
              expressly defined in the US Constitution. </LI></OL>

            <CENTER>Federal Admiralty Jurisdiction</CENTER>
            <P>The federal government frequently moves in Admiralty 
            Jurisdiction.  The term used by the government more recently is 
            "Special Maritime Jurisdiction".  They are the same animal.   
            <P>Admiralty jurisdiction deals primarily (or maybe we should say 
            "originally") with ships and occurrences upon the water.  This 
            special jurisdiction was a result of the issues of international 
            shipping, questions of ownership over ships and their cargo, "prize" 
            issues [defeating a ship in battle at sea], piracy, controversies 
            over shipped goods when the owners are not in America, salvage of 
            vessels and goods, and various Customs issues. 
            <P>When our nation was first founded, Admiralty jurisdiction was 
            restricted by the "rule of tides".  Under this rule, Admiralty 
            jurisdiction could only be invoked if the circumstance took place on 
            water (or at dock) subject to the natural forces of the tides.  
            However, over time that yardstick was throw aside and Admiralty's 
            reach was expanded (by court decisions) to embrace all actions 
            previously cognizable under Admiralty, but which took place on any 
            navigable waterway under the jurisdiction of the United States.  In 
            other words, if it's a navigable waterway that is in the United 
            States (federal territory) or if the waterway is used for interstate 
            commerce, certain controversies that arise in such circumstances can 
            be heard in Admiralty jurisdiction. 
            <P>It should be noted that the states of the Union also have 
            Admiralty jurisdiction when dealing with issues of intrastate 
            commerce, or when a state is acting as an agent (under agreement 
            with the US Secretary of Transportation) for the federal government 
            in the enforcement of interstate commerce regulations associated 
            with navigable waterways. 
            <P>It is widely theorized by tax law researchers that IRS seizures 
            are all made under Admiralty jurisdiction derived form an alleged 
            violation of a Custom's regulation.  The government is currently 
            disputing this argument by stating that federal court actions 
            involving seizure are commenced under the Federal Code of Civil 
            Procedure.  However, many (but not all) procedural aspects of 
            Admiralty actions are controlled by the Federal Code of Civil 
            Procedure. 
            <P>
            <CENTER>Civil Codes with Criminal Penalties?</CENTER>
            <P>Having discussed the difference between civil actions and 
            criminal actions, one might wonder why some offenses contained in 
            civil [non-penal] codes can result in consequences usually thought 
            to be exclusively for criminal acts (such as going to jail). 
            <P>Here in California there are two doctrines that seem to be in 
            conflict at first glance.  One item of controlling case law states 
            that if you are engaged in an activity that is cognizable under the 
            authority of one the various civil codes, these codes can include 
            penalties that are, in their nature, criminal penalties.  While the 
            court was not specific as to when such "criminal penalties" attach 
            to a civil offense, we can only conclude that they are limited to 
            cases that are regulated through a license.  It is only in such a 
            circumstance that the defendant made a prior agreement to abide by 
            the conditions of the code and is therefore presumed to know that 
            criminal penalties are a part of the "agreement".  In short, the 
            court appears to be saying, "If you don't like water, stay out of 
            the pool." 
            <P>In the second case, the a California appeals court struck down 
            the jail-time portion of a sentence handed down to a former Los 
            Angeles County Supervisor who'd been convicted of the misuse of 
            campaign funds.  In its decision, the court stated that the offense 
            was civil in nature and therefore the maximum sentence that could be 
            imposed was a fine, not jail time.  This would appear to be a 
            regulatory violation that was not supported by any form of "license" 
            (i.e. prior agreement) and therefore the defendant had never 
            "agreed" to allow criminal penalties to be applied to him for a 
            civil offense. 
            <P>
            <CENTER>The Amazing Disappearing Law</CENTER>
            <P>Laws do not actually disappear, but their language is altered 
            over time to obscure the true purpose and intent of the law.  One 
            would think that once a law is passed it would not need to be 
            altered unless some flaw or shortcoming becomes apparent, or some 
            circumstance changes that requires the statute to keep up with the 
            times.  I think the average citizen would be surprised to learn that 
            statutes are amended to alter their language for no <EM><B>apparent 
            reason</B></EM>.  We stress the word "apparent" because the 
            legislative draftsmen who propose these changes know exactly what 
            their purpose is. 
            <P>In the following fictitious example, we are going to provide you 
            with the year that the statute was passed as well as the text.  I 
            will then give you the year of each amendment of the statute that 
            changes the prior language.  After viewing the progression of the 
            changes, look again at the original version and take note of all the 
            clarity that has been lost.  You will see how the changes have 
            rendered it impossible for a person to know the original intent of 
            the law.  This practice is more common than you would believe.

            <CENTER>The "Other" Law</CENTER>
            <P>There is a form of "law" that is not really law at all.  It's 
            commonly referred to as "case law" (also known as "decisional law" 
            or "precedent").  Case law is the previous ruling on a point of law 
            by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Case law, when used properly, 
            was/is intended to provide consistency concerning points of law over 
            time.  In theory, this allows a person to go into court on 
            particular subject in the year 2005 and feel confident that the 
            court will make the same ruling on a particular point of law that a 
            neighboring court made in 2000.  On the surface, who can complain?! 
            <P>Unfortunately, that leaves the meaning and/or application of 
            specific points of law up to a just about every Tom, Dick, and Harry 
            who wears a black robe.  We believe that today most practicing 
            attorneys will admit that case law has become a quagmire of 
            conflicting opinions that all to often lead to more confusion, than 
            clarity. 
            <P>There are two institutionalized problems with case law that need 
            correction before this disaster called "case law" can be rectified; 
            they are integrally connected. 
            <P>The first problem is a general unwillingness on the part of 
            lawyers to challenge existing case law.  There are two arguments 
            that can be used to challenge case law: 
            <P>
            <OL>
              <LI>Aver that the circumstances that led to the ruling on a point 
              of law in the previous case are not substantially the same as are 
              at issue in the current case and therefore the ruling on the point 
              of law in the previous case is not controlling in the current 
              case. 
              <LI>Aver that the circumstances that led to the ruling on a point 
              of law in the previous case are the same as in the current case, 
              but that the previous court simply ruled in error concerning the 
              issue of law in question. 
              <LI>Show that what has been passing for case law is actually 
              nothing more than <EM>obiter dictum</EM>. </LI></OL>
            <P>Stated plainly, most lawyers are just too lazy tackle option 
            number one.  This sort of argument takes time and effort to put 
            forth and is rarely seen except in high-dollar corporate legal 
            battles.  In most courtrooms case law is never challenged - even 
            when it's not terribly applicable. 
            <P>Option 2 is basically dead on arrival.  Lawyers will almost never 
            aver to one court that the decision of a previous court is just flat 
            out wrong.  Even on the rare occassions that an attorney is 
            motivated enough to make the argument, the court is virtually never 
            willing to overturn a fellow judge's ruing on a point of law.  We 
            get the impression that like the aristocracy of old, today's judges 
            consider it impolite or ungentlemanly to publicly declare another 
            learned and honorable judge to be wrong.   
            <P>Option 3 would require an attorney to actually read the court's 
            decision and sometimes all the briefs, motions, and others filings 
            from the very beginning of the case.  Reading previously decided 
            cases is very time-consuming and at times exceedingly boring.  
            Neither of these are the kind of things with which attorneys like to 
            involve themselves.  For most attorneys that kind of arduous effort 
            ended on the day they graduated law school. 
            <P>The second significant problem with case law is that while many 
            judges are willing to follow it blindly, other judges seem unwilling 
            to follow the precedent of their state Supreme Courts or the 
            decisions of the US Supreme Court, even when the issue before the 
            court is well settled by the higher courts.  While the motives of 
            such judges may be speculated upon by layperson and lawyer alike, 
            the solution is cheered by the public and dreaded by the BAR 
            associations.  Judges who disregard case law that is clearly and 
            correctly applicable to the matter before them should be removed 
            from the bench by a panel of Citizens, their pensions should be 
            forfeit upon removal, and judgments should be issued against them 
            for any injury done to their victims. 
            <P>
            <CENTER><A name="language">The Language of Law</A></CENTER>
            <P>One of the greatest stumbling blocks for the American public in 
            understanding the laws their representatives enact is that laws use 
            words in a different manner than we do in common speech. 
            <P>There are two kinds of language that are primarily used in law - 
            one is "words" (just as we use in common speech) and the other is 
            "terms" (which can be substantially different than we use in common 
            speech). 
            <P>"Words" are just that - words.  They are presumed to be used in 
            their ordinary manner and they are subject to the "plain meaning 
            rule" when interpreting a statute.  Their meaning must be sought 
            through the common English dictionaries of the era in which the 
            statute was written.  In the absence of any clear contrary intent by 
            the legislature, the meaning found in these dictionaries is the sole 
            meaning that must be given to the word. 
            <P>"Terms" are another matter.  Terms appear no different, to the 
            layperson, than words.  The difference is that terms are not subject 
            to the "plain meaning rule" because the legislature has provided its 
            <EM><B>own</B></EM> definition for the term being used.  Where the 
            legislature has provided its own definition, the ordinary English 
            dictionary must be thrown out the window; the definition given to 
            the term by the legislature controls the meaning completely. 
            <P>The meanings of terms can be identified by seeking out the 
            "definitions" section applicable the text that you are reading.  
            Unfortunately, this may not always be as straight forward a 
            proposition as one might imagine. 
            <P>Most codes provide a section that gives definitions that are 
            generally applicable throughout the entire code, however any of the 
            definitions given for the entire code are subject to be redefined in 
            any given subtitle, chapter, section, subsection, or clause.  Any 
            time a term is redefined for a specific subtitle, chapter, section, 
            subsection, or clause, that redefinition of the term takes precedent 
            (within that subtitle, chapter, section, subsection, or clause) over 
            the general definition provided for the entire code.   Of course, to 
            make matters more confusing, any time a term is redefined for use in 
            a subtitle, chapter, section, subsection, or clause, it can be 
            redefined again and again as you move from subtitle to chapter; 
            chapter to chapter; chapter to section; section to section; section 
            to clause, etc.  In other words, you always have to be on your toes 
            and make sure you know the definitions that apply to the exact text 
            your reading! 
            <P>Here is an example.  26 USC 7701 contains definitions that 
            applicable for the entire Internal Revenue Code.  Section 
            7701(a)(20) defined "<B>employee</B>":

              79 with respect to group-term life insurance purchased for 
              employees, for the purpose of applying the provisions of sections 
              104, 105, and 106 with respect to accident and health insurance or 
              accident and health plans, and for the purpose of applying the 
              provisions of subtitle A with respect to contributions to or under 
              a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan, and with 
              respect to distributions under such a plan, or by a trust forming 
              part of such a plan, and for purposes of applying section 125 with 
              respect to cafeteria plans, the term ''employee'' shall include a 
              full-time life insurance salesman who is considered an employee 
              for the purpose of chapter 21, or in the case of services 
              performed before January 1, 1951, who would be considered an 
              employee if his services were performed during 1951.</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>The term is redefined for use in chapter 24 of the Code: (26 USC 
            3401(c)) 
            <P>For purposes of this chapter, the term ''<B>employee</B>'' 
            includes an officer, employee, or elected official of the United 
            States, a State, or any political subdivision thereof, or the 
            District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or 
            more of the foregoing.  The term ''employee'' also includes an 
            officer of a corporation. 
            <P>As you can see the terms are defined very differently.  The 
            title-wide definition addresses insurance salesmen, while the 
            definition for chapter 24 addresses only government workers under 
            the direct or indirect authority of the federal government.  [The 
            corporation that is mentioned is a corporation wholly owned by the 
            federal government.]

            <CENTER>Words of Art</CENTER>
            <P>Although "Words of Art" are often placed (by the layperson) in 
            the same category as "terms", they are not the same thing.  Words of 
            Art are words or phrases that are particular to specific 
            technologies, sciences, arts, professions, etc., and generally do 
            not have the same meaning, or any meaning at all, outside their own 
            field.  One example of this is the medical word, "orthopod".   The 
            word, "orthopod" is generally used within the medical community to 
            indicate a person who has surgical training and experience in 
            arthroscopy.  Outside the medical field, "orthopod" has no meaning 
            whatsoever.  While "terms" are often used by politicians and lawyers 
            to mask the true intentions or application of legislation from the 
            general public (especially in tax law), Words of Art are a proper 
            and necessary parts of effective communication in the legal arena.

            <CENTER>Does the Law Work?</CENTER>
            <P>At this juncture we would like to warn the uninitiated reader 
            that politicians, lawyers, government employees and officers, and 
            judges, do not really care what the law says.  Read that sentence 
            again and then burn it into your memory; it will save you a lot of 
            angry days and sleepless nights. 
            <P>There is a vast difference between what the law says and "how the 
            system works".  Here is something else for you to burn into your 
            memory - the system has been hijacked from <B>The People</B> and it 
            now functions for four primary purposes: 
            <P>
            <OL>
              <LI>Government control of persons and property. 
              <LI>The receipt of revenue, either by lawful action or 
              extortionate conduct. 
              <LI>The protection of the system that provides for points 1 and 2. 
              <LI>The protection of persons who facilitate points 1, 2, and 3. 
              </LI></OL>
            <P>If you are one of the uninitiated, the statement made above may 
            seem somewhat reactionary to you.  However, all one need do to learn 
            that these statements are true is to stand your ground when the 
            government accosts you and they are legally in the wrong.  If you 
            are a person of integrity and good faith, you will expect your 
            government to sit down with you, read the law, and cease their 
            unlawful actions against you.  What you will not be prepared for is 
            the attack that will be made upon you by your government in 
            retaliation for your audacity!  On the other hand, if your 
            government is not accosting you, but you notice that it is acting in 
            a manner that is contrary to the written law, if you bring that fact 
            to the government's attention, the government will fall completely 
            silent and never respond (with anything substantive) to your 
            comments, observations, or requests for correction.

            <P>The government generally uses the law as an offensive tool to 
            compel the population to comply with its edicts.  In most cases the 
            government could care less whether it is acting lawfully, or whether 
            it is even applying the law to the intended persons or property.  
            The government only cares that there is a superficial appearance of 
            legality.  Americans can use the law as either an offensive tool or 
            a defensive tool depending on the circumstance and your preference.

            <CENTER>Lawyers</CENTER>
            <P>Many people despise lawyers.  We suspect that much of that is due 
            to various realities of the legal trade and not because the men and 
            women who become lawyers are inherently bad or evil.  However, 
            nearly all lawyers have one fatal flaw that damages the law, the 
            truth, your rights, and the very fabric of our nation.  The flaw is 
            their unwillingness to argue the law.  That may sound odd, but it is 
            true. 
            <P>For the most part, lawyers operate within the courts.  Those who 
            do not function within the courts, usually function within the 
            corporate environment.  Both the courts, and most corporations, 
            operate within "the system".  One might hope that "the system" means 
            our system of laws.  Unfortunately, "law" takes a very distant 
            backseat to politics and monetary objectives.  Sadly, in the America 
            of the new millennium, "the system" is whatever government 
            bureaucrats, politicians and money-powers say it is.  Lawyers 
            understand this, and with rare exception, are unwilling to buck "the 
            system".  If we have one direct criticism of lawyers, it is that the 
            majority of them are moral cowards, not caring what is truly right, 
            nor being willing to fight for it. 
            <P>Let us give you a common example: We will speak to an attorney 
            about something of a general nature.  During the discussion, we will 
            state a rule of statutory construction and ask the attorney to 
            agree.  He/She will agree that the rule has been stated correctly, 
            including its proper application.  We will then lead that attorney 
            to a more controversial area, such as tax law, and apply the rule 
            that was just discussed to the exact same circumstance of 
            construction.  Once we point out how the rule must be applied and 
            make note of the consequences thereof, the attorney either falls 
            silent or becomes defensive and angry.   
            <P>We do not wish to leave you with the view that all attorneys are 
            rotten or worthless.  Like all professionals, they may serve a 
            purpose at times.  However, we encourage you to gain as much legal 
            expertise as possible on your own through reading and study, and we 
            urge you to not blindly place your faith, you future, your rights, 
            or your possessions, in the hands of lawyers because we know that 
            they will generally not serve you well or faithfully.
