intrude upon expectations of privacy as to medical information”)

(a)Clerical Mistakes. In judgements, orders, or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time of it's own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such notice, if any, as the court orders. During the pendency of an appeal, such mistakes may be so corrected before the appeal is docketed in the appellate court, and thereafter while the appeal is pending may be so corrected with leave of of the appellate court.

Writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, audita querela, and bills of review and bills in the nature of a bill or review, are abolished, and the procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be by motion as prescribed in these rules or by an independent action.

51) It is one thing to find that the Tribe has agreed to sell the right to use the land and take valuable minerals from it, and quite another to find that the Tribe has abandoned its sovereign powers simply because it has not expressly reserved them through a contract. To presume that a sovereign forever waives the right to exercise one of its powers unless it expressly reserves the right to exercise that power in a commercial agreement turns the concept of sovereignty on its head. MERRION ET AL., DBA MERRION & BAYLESS, ET AL. v. JICARILLA APACHE TRIBE ET AL. 1982.SCT.394 , 455 U.S. 130, 102 S. Ct. 894, 71 L. Ed. 2d 21, 50 U.S.L.W. 4169 pp. 144-148. (Bold emphasis added here)

State v. Robinson 145 Me. 77, 72 Atl. 2d 260, 262 (1950).

54) "The offense of resisting arrest, both at common law and under statute, presupposes a lawful arrest. It is axiomatic (self-evident) that every person has the right to resist an unlawful arrest. In such a case the person attempting to arrest stands in the position of a wrongdoer and may be resisted by the use of force, as in self-defense." State v. Mobley 240 N.C. 476, 83 S.E. 2d 100, 102 (1954).

55) "All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are null and void." Marbury vs. Madison

56) "There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated authority contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the constitution, can be valid. To deny this, would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than the principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men, acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid."-Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist #78

 Case Law of Supreme Court Decisions which pertain to a Citizen's Right to Travel:

“The right of a citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon in the ordinary course of life and business is a common right which he has under his right to enjoy life and liberty, to acquire and possess property, and pursue happiness and security. It includes the right in so doing to use the ordinary and usual conveyances of the day, and includes the right to operate an automobile thereon, for the usual and ordinary purposes of life and business. It is not a privilege, like the privilege of moving a house on the street, operating a business stand on the street, or transporting persons or property for hire along the street, which a city may permit or prohibit at will.”

"Citizens may resist unlawful arrest to the point of taking an arresting officer's life if necessary.” Plummer v. State, 136 Ind. 306. This premise was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case: John Bad Elk v. U.S., 177 U.S. 529. The Court stated: “Where the officer is killed in the course of the disorder which naturally accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted, the law looks with very different eyes upon the transaction, when the officer had the right to make the arrest, from what it does if the officer had no right. What may be murder in the first case might be nothing more than manslaughter in the other, or the facts might show that no offense had been committed.”

“An arrest made with a defective warrant, or one issued without affidavit, or one that fails to allege a crime is within jurisdiction, and one who is being arrested, may resist arrest and break away. lf the arresting officer is killed by one who is so resisting, the killing will be no more than an involuntary manslaughter.” Housh v. People, 75 111. 491; reaffirmed and quoted in State v. Leach, 7 Conn. 452; State v. Gleason, 32 Kan. 245; Ballard v. State, 43 Ohio 349; State v Rousseau, 241 P. 2d 447; State v. Spaulding, 34 Minn. 3621.

“These principles apply as well to an officer attempting to make an arrest, who abuses his authority and transcends the bounds thereof by the use of unnecessary force and violence, as they do to a private individual who unlawfully uses such force and violence.” Jones v. State, 26 Tex. App. I; Beaverts v. State, 4 Tex. App. 1 75; Skidmore v. State, 43 Tex. 93, 903.

“An illegal arrest is an assault and battery. The person so attempted to be restrained of his liberty has the same right to use force in defending himself as he would in repelling any other assault and battery.” (State v. Robinson, 145 ME. 77, 72 ATL. 260).

“Each person has the right to resist an unlawful arrest. In such a case, the person attempting the arrest stands in the position of a wrongdoer and may be resisted by the use of force, as in self- defense.” (State v. Mobley, 240 N.C. 476, 83 S.E. 2d 100).


"Statutes that violate the plain and obvious principles of common right and common reason are null and void." Bennett v. Boggs, 1 Baldw 60.

State v. Robinson 145 Me. 77, 72 Atl. 2d 260, 262 (1950)

“One may come to the aid of another being unlawfully arrested, just as he may where one is being assaulted, molested, raped or kidnapped. Thus it is not an offense to liberate one from the unlawful custody of an officer, even though he may have submitted to such custody, without resistance.” (Adams v. State, 121 Ga. 16, 48 S.E. 910).

“Story affirmed the right of self-defense by persons held illegally. In his own writings, he had admitted that ‘a situation could arise in which the checks-and-balances principle ceased to work and the various branches of government concurred in a gross usurpation.’ There would be no usual remedy by changing the law or passing an amendment to the Constitution, should the oppressed party be a minority. Story concluded, ‘If there be any remedy at all ... it is a remedy never provided for by human institutions.’ That was the ‘ultimate right of all human beings in extreme cases to resist oppression, and to apply force against ruinous injustice.’” (From Mutiny on the Amistad by Howard Jones, Oxford University Press, 1987, an account of the reading of the decision in the case by Justice Joseph Story of the Supreme Court.

“Fraud upon the court” makes void the orders and judgments of that court. The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held that a void order is void at all times, does not have to be reversed or vacated by a judge, cannot be made valid by any judge, nor does it gain validity by the passage of time. The order is void ab initio. Vallely v. Northern Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 254 U.S. 348, 41 S.Ct. 116 (1920). “Fraud destroys the validity of everything into which it enters,” Nudd v. Burrows (1875), 91 US 426, 23 Led 286,290; particularly when “a judge himself is a party to the fraud,” Cone v. Harris (Okl. 1924), 230 P. 721, 723. Windsor v. McVeigh (1876), 93 US 276, 23 Led 914, 918.

“An order is void if it was procured by fraud upon the court,” In re Village of Willowbrook, 37 Ill. App. 3D 393(1962)
The U.S. Supreme Court, in Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683,1687 (1974) states "when a state officer acts under a state law in a manner violative of the Federal Constitution, he "comes into conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution, and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct. The State has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States";

heard is not a judicial determination of his rights, and is not entitled to respect in any other

"If a court grants relief, which under the circumstances it hasn't any authority to grant, its judgment is to that extent void." (1 Freeman on Judgments, 120-c.)
“When judges act when they do not have jurisdiction to act, or they enforce a void order (an order issued by a judge without jurisdiction), they become trespassers of the law, and are engaged in treason,” The Court in Yates v. Village of Hoffman Estates, Illinois, 209 F.Supp. 757 (N.D. Ill. 1962) held that "not every action by a judge is in exercise of his judicial function. ... it is not a judicial function for a judge to commit an intentional tort even though the tort occurs in the courthouse."

Hey  I know how you feel about the strength and confidence. It made me lmao when I learned these things. Even more so when we tested it and it worked. It's knowing who you really are.... not who the govt tells you you are, and standing in your truth. It makes you feel pretty much invincible. lol

About your birth certificate, you only have a certified copy of that anyway. The original is on file with the state. You can get as many certified copies as you want. Here in Ga, you just go to the local probate court and fill out a request form for how many ever copies you want. Some places you have to get them from the Health dept. There is a fee, here it is $25 for the first copy and $5 for each additional. I got several copies of my daughter's BC because she got arrested like 4 times in less than a year. I knew I was gonna need them. 

   I will tell you this... my daughter Amber got 2 tickets when she was arrested this one time. One for open container (which her bf had left in the car when he used it, she doesn't drink) and one for no tag. This was our test. She went to court, ready to reserve her rights on the record and do everything like she'd practiced, but she didn't have to even do that. They told everyone over 21 to go in the hall. A lady came around with a clipboard and got everyone to sign it and check if they were pleading guilty or not guilty. When it got to Amber, she signed it after she wrote "All rights reserved without prejudice". Then she said "what if I'm not pleading?" the lady said "How can you not plead?" Amber said "I'm just not pleading". The lady went into the clerk's office and came back in a few minutes and asked to see her tickets, which Amber handed to her and said "I am not this PERSON." The lady said "You're not Amber?"  She said "I am Amber, but I'm not the PERSON on this ticket, and this is not my address"  The lady took the tickets and went into the clerk's office again. She came out in a few minutes, handed Amber the tickets and said "You're in the wrong court, you should go down and check with Superior court."  Superior court doesn't do tickets btw. She was just getting rid of her because they couldn't do anything without her consenting to be the strawman PERSON. We checked with Sup. Court anyway, they said, "we don't handle tickets, go to probate court". Amber said to me "Mama what just happened?" I said "It worked! That's what happened! You're FREE !!"  We laughed all the way home. 

   This gave her the confidence to try it again at Superior court- for possession of shit that was in a car of ppl she was riding with because noone would claim it, so they all got charged. That is like arresting someone for not admitting to something they didn't do. That is a violation of 5th amendment rights.
Anyway, at court she didn't answer to a name when they called the name, she just stood up and said "I'm here regarding that matter". She tried to stay behind the bar and reserve her rights, but the DA's all yelled at her to go up to the microphone because the old judge couldn't hear her. So she did. She reserved her rights and said she did not consent. But she was nervous and kind of hesitated, so the judge went ahead with his normal routine and told her to get an attorney and come back on a later date.  She was intimidated, naturally and signed the paper that she would get an attorney. But as usual she reserved her rights 'without prejudice' on that contract, which basically means you are signing under protest which renders the contract null and void. Just for good measure tho, we filed a letter in with her case file similar to the one I showed you, stating that she is a living creation of God the Creator and does not consent to their false authority, and that she rescinds any contract she may have signed without full disclosure of all the facts....  the birth certificate accompanied that letter. 
She went back at the next court date, even tho ( I have learned) she really didn't have to, but we watched what they were doing with the other people going up ahead of her. The judge was asking each if they had gotten an attorney or public defender. When it was Amber's turn she went up there and reserved her rights. The judge asked if she had gotten a public defender, to which she read the response I had written for her... " I am unable to find a public defender who is not a foreign BAR lawyer, registered under the crown of Great Brittain, that is qualified to represent a living American, therefore due process cannot be served"  The judges mouth just hung open...he didn't know what to say. He just said "Well, what do you want?" at this point, she should have said she wanted the charges dismissed, or she wanted the matter settled, or she could have just said she wants to leave, lol, but she hesitated and he said he was going to arraign her. He did this for the sake of all the other slaves watching. He can't let them know the truth, or they will all be trying it and their system of fraud and deciept will collapse. Again she was scared and signed the arraignment paper, but she signed it 'without prejudice'. Again, we filed a letter of rescission with her case. That was it... case disappeared. I checked back with the court about a month later, they said there is no case pending on her. 

I hope I'm not wasting too much of your time. I'm telling you our experience because I know you have doubts and court is a scary place full of liars and mutherfuckers that just want to enslave you. Just stay in your truth and you don't have to worry. 

I will tell you what happened at the next case that came up against her....again a victimless crime. Well she stood up there and said " I'm not the PERSON on these charges",  and tried to surrender the PERSON/Birth certificate. She forgot to reserve her rights first (mistake) that's when it turned into a circus. The judge kept asking her name, if she was AMBER STARR DRINNON. She said "I am Amber, but I'm not the PERSON on these charges". She should have just said "I don't understand" that's what you say to any question they ask you really. So the judge says "If there's no AMBER STARR DRINNON in this courtroom, I'm issuing a bench warrant for AMBER STARR DRINNON" If anyone sees AMBER STARR DRINNON,  there is a bench warrant for her. As Amber goes to leave, the DA stopped her and said "uh, aren't you AMBER STARR DRINNON? Judge isn't there a bench warrant for AMBER STARR DRINNON?" He called the bailiff guys over to arrest her. This was all a bluff and I knew it. I got up and went to her aide saying "She is not AMBER STARR DRINNON, she is a free living American and you have no jurisdiction! Here is the PERSON you want!" (handing the DA her birth certificate). He pulled his hands back and said "I don't want that" (it's like kryptonite to them and renders them powerless over the living breathing creation of God.) They took her out of the room. I went and sat down right behind the DA's and yelled at them "Y'ALL ARE FRAUDS!!"  Some other lady down the row from me hollered "YEP!!"   They are scared of We the People knowing the truth. He immediately stood up and told the judge he wanted to recall that case.  (Hahaha that's what I thought.) It was all a bluff....a show for the other people in the courtroom waiting for their turn to consent to be a slave of the system. So they waited until all the other cases were done, then brought her back out. The judge asked if she was AMBER STARR DRINNON, of course she said yes....but they had threatened and coerced her into a contract by making her say she was this PERSON. Corporations can't lawfully contract with a living human, only with other corporations. So again, the next day we filed a letter of rescission into her case file with birth certificate attached, and *poof* case disappeared.  

For extra protection, we sent the DA an OPPT 'Courtesy Notice' (I have attached a pdf file of this document for you) You can use this anytime anyone is trying to get you to pay off a debt or a loan.
It includes a fee schedule, by accepting this document and doing any of the things listed on the fee schedule, they have activated the contract and you can start sending them invoices for their payment to you in silver coin. It's really just to get them to leave you alone and stop trying to take your shit. Study the guidelines if you want to use this. It's fairly simple and effective. 

So you have nothing to fear but fear and I hope I have alleviated some of that. Even tho Amber screwed up left and right, the letters still worked. That's why they call Sovereign citizens "Paper terrorists" lol

I have another short story of a lady I helped. She was offered a plea bargain of 20 years do 15 for a burglary she didn't do. I told her about all of this stuff and went to court with her the day she was to accept or reject the plea bargain. She stood with her attorney and the mean DA bitch. After they were done with their little formalities, she asked the judge if she could say something. First thing she said "Are we still on the record?" Judge said yes. She said very calmly, with confidence and without hesitation.. " I would like to reserve my rights on the record" Judge asked what rights did she want to reserve. She answered  "All of my rights as a living American". and then she went on to say some other things she needed to say about her specific situation. Anyway, long story, she was supposed to be at her jury trial a couple weeks later, but she left the state and went to her Mom's. Subsequently, she was arrested on unrelated charge in the other state. They saw she had a FTA warrant from the county where her case was here, but in a couple of days when it was time for them to expedite her back to Ga, they just released her and told her she was free to go, "Cobb county said they didn't want you".
So here is another example of how powerful just reserving your rights is and claiming to be the living man. They can't get jurisdiction.


I made the following notes for Amber to take with her into the court, based on what I got from the 'Beat the Law' article. You can use these if you want: 

                      ***********************************************

(Roll call:)     "I'm here regarding that matter"
(When called, walk to end of seats, not into well of the court.) 
( Do not answer to any name. Say NOTHING except this:)      

     "Are we on the record?"

( Proceed with: ) 
     "Let the record show that I, Patrick, reserve all of my rights, without prejudice,
per UCC 1-308, and I DO NOT CONSENT ."
 
(Hand someone the Birth Certificate, or let fall into the court floor)
     "Let the record also show that the PERSON and Birth Certificate
 have been surrendered to the court."
      
( Turn and leave. Do not stop, do not answer questions! ) _________________________________________
( If you are stopped by force:   Do NOT resist! )    
( Do not answer to any name! Do not give a name or address!
  If called a 'name', say: ) 

     "I am NOT that PERSON. I am the Beneficiary 
 and I reserve my rights UCC 1-308...
     "I have already surrendered the PERSON and birth certificate into the well of the court."
     "As a 'special visitor' to your foreign court, I wish to invoke diplomatic immunity"
_______________________________________
(If judge asks about a public defender, say:)

     " I am unable to find a public defender that is not a foreign BAR attorney, registered under the crown of Great Brittain, that is qualified to represent a living American"
 _______________________________________
( If judge keeps asking questions, simply say: )

     "Can anything I say be used against me?"  and/or
     " I don't understand."   and then:                           
           
       "Is the matter is settled?"
 ________________________________________
( If the judge leaves the bench, say: )

      "Let the record show that the judge has abandoned the case and the case is now dismissed - WITH prejudice."

                     ************************************************

Really you can just leave, but more likely- from our experience, the judge will try to carry on like business as usual, and reset another court date for you. This is a bluff. You don't really have to go. When/if you receive a notice of this next court date, ( it is actually just an offer to contract) you can stick a label on the envelope where your NAME is that says: "NO CONTRACT - RETURN TO SENDER" and mail it back.
You can even open it and write across it diagonally:  "NO ACCEPTANCE OF OFFER"   but do not sign it anywhere. This should be done within 3 days of receipt if possible.

It might be helpful for you to go to the court one day before the 20th if you can, and just observe. Get used to what they do and say. At the least it may ease your nervousness a little. 

I have more stuff to send you in another email. This one's getting a little bit long. :)
