<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Corpus Juris Secundum &sect;151. &ndash; &nbsp;Chauffeur or Operator
<br>

A distinction is recognized between an operator and a chauffeur under
some licensing regulations,
<br>

&ldquo;chauffeur&rdquo; referring to one who is paid for driving an automobile.
<br>

60 C.J.S.&nbsp; MOTOR VEHICLES &sect;&sect; 150 - 151, p. 797 ( also
see &ldquo;Tests&rdquo;(1) and (2))
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The California Appellate Court in 1948 defined what types of licensing
is required to operate a "motor
<br>

vehicle:
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Section 250 . . . "(a) It is a misdemeanor&nbsp;
for any person to drive a motor vehicle upon a
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; highway unless he then holds a valid operator's
or chauffeur's license . . . .."&nbsp; . . . . driving
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; privileges--of which the&nbsp; license is
but evidence (People v. Noggle (1935), 7 Cal.App.2d 14, 17,
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [45 P.2d 430, 432]) People v. Higgins (1948)
97 Cal.App.2d Supp. 938, 939, 941; 197 P.2d 417.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The foregoing court citation clearly shows that the &ldquo;operator&rsquo;s license&rdquo;
permits engagement in commercial
<br>

activity.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1. (b) The word "operator" shall
include all persons, firms, associations and
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corporations who operate motor vehicles upon
any public highway in this state and thereby
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; engage in the transportation of persons or
property for hire or compensation, but shall not
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include any person, firm, association or corporation
who solely transports by motor vehicle
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persons to and from or to and from attendance
upon any public school or who solely transports
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his or its own property, or employees, or
both, and who transports no persons or property for
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hire or compensation...
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 2. Each operator of a motor vehicle
within this state who transports or desires to
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transport for compensation or hire persons
or property upon or over any public highway
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within this state shall apply to and secure
from the board of equalization of the State of California
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a license to operate each and all of the motor
vehicles which such operator desires to operate
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or which such operator from time to time may
operate."

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>CARRIERS</b>, contracts. There are two kinds of carriers, namely,
common&nbsp; carriers, (q.v.) who have been
<br>

considered under another head; and private carriers. These latter are
persons who, although they do not
<br>

undertake to transport the goods of such as choose to employ them,
yet agree to carry the&nbsp; goods of some
<br>

particular person for hire, from one place to another.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In such case the carrier incurs no responsibility
beyond that of any other ordinary bailee for hire, that
<br>

is to say, the responsibility of&nbsp; ordinary diligence. 2 Bos. &amp;

Wagoner Who carries goods for hire, contracts, the responsibility of
a common carrier, whether
<br>

transportation be his principal and direct business, or only an occasional
and incidental employment.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. To bring a person within the description
of a common carrier, he must exercise his business as a
<br>

public employment; he must undertake to carry goods for persons generally;
and he must hold himself out
<br>

as ready to engage in the transportation of goods for hire, as a business;
not as a casual occupation pro hac
