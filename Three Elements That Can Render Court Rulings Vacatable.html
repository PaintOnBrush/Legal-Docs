                          validity of everything into which it enters, and that
                          it vitiates the most solemn contracts, documents, and

                      <ul>
                        <li>The general misconception is that any statute passed
                          by legislators bearing the appearance of law
                          constitutes the law of the land. The U.S. Constitution
                          is the supreme law of the land, and any statute, to be
                          valid, must be in agreement. It is impossible for both
                          the Constitution and a law violating it to be valid;
                          one must prevail. This is succinctly stated as
                          follows:
                          <p>The general rule is that an unconstitutional
                          statute, though having the form and name of law, is in
                          reality no law, but is wholly void, and ineffective
                          for any purpose; since unconstitutionality dates from
                          the time of its enactment, and not merely from the
                          date of the decision so branding it. An
                          unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation, is as
                          inoperative as if it had never been passed. Such a
                          statute leaves the question that it purports to settle
                          just as it would be had the statute not been enacted.
                          <p>Since an unconstitutional law is void, the general
                          principles follow that it imposes no duties, confers
                          no rights, creates no office, bestows no power or
                          authority on anyone, affords no protection, and
                          justifies no acts performed under it. . .
                          <p>A void act cannot be legally consistent with a
                          valid one. An unconstitutional law cannot operate to
                          supersede any existing valid law. Indeed, insofar as a
                          statute runs counter to the fundamental law of the
                          land, it is superseded thereby.
                          <p><b>No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law
                          and no courts are bound to enforce it.</b>

                        <li>&quot;Although there formerly was a conflict of
                          authority with respect to the proof of jurisdiction or
                          the lack of jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has
                          declared that <b>one who claims that the power of the
                          court should be exercised in one's behalf must carry
                          throughout the litigation the burden of showing that
                          he or she is properly in court. Accordingly, if a
                          party's allegations of jurisdictional facts are
                          challenged by an adversary in any appropriate manner,
                          he or she must support them by competent proof</b>,
                          and, even where they are not so challenged, the court
                          may still insist that the jurisdictional facts be
                          established or the case be dismissed, and for that
                          purpose the court may demand that the party alleging
                          jurisdiction justify his or her allegations by a
                          preponderance of evidence. However, it is not
                          mandatory upon the court to call upon the party
                          asserting jurisdiction to establish it by proof, in
                          the event that the party's jurisdictional averments
                          are not properly challenged by the adversary, and, in
                          such a case, application may be made of the rule that <b>proof
                          in support of jurisdictional averments need not be
                          offered where the defendant does not formally plead to
                          [challenge] the jurisdiction.</b>&quot; <i>§ 2.455,

                          statement wake anybody up to the critical reason why
                          it is important to always challenge jurisdiction to be
                          sure it is truly bona fide? Since there is no statute
                          of limitations on fraud, jurisdiction can be
                          challenged at any time, even after a case has been
                          &quot;decided&quot;. [smile] And further, were you

                          presumed to have waived any jurisdictional challenges
                          because of the attorney being an &quot;officer of the

                          a case. 147 P.2d 759, 761. This power may be
                          established and described with reference to particular
                          subjects or to parties who fall into a particular
                          category. In addition to the power to adjudicate, a <b>valid</b>
                          exercise of jurisdiction requires fair <b>notice</b>
                          and an opportunity for the affected parties to be
                          heard. <b>Without jurisdiction, a court's judgment is
                          void.</b> A court must have both SUBJECT MATTER
                          JURISDICTION and PERSONAL JURISDICTION (see below).

                          particular category of cases. Federal district courts
                          have &quot;limited&quot; jurisdiction in that they
                          have only such jurisdiction as is explicitly conferred
                          by federal statutes. 28 U.S.C. §1330 [EDITOR'S NOTE: see
                          also 40 U.S.C.S. §255] et seq. See LIMITED [SPECIAL]
                          JURISDICTION. Many state trial courts have
                          &quot;general&quot; jurisdiction to hear almost all
                          matters. The parties to a lawsuit may not waive a
                          requirement of subject matter jurisdiction.
