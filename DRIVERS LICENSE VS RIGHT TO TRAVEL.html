    <p align="left">DESPITE ACTIONS OF POLICE AND LOCAL COURTS, <br>
    HIGHER COURTS HAVE RULED THAT AMERICAN CITIZENS <br>
    HAVE A RIGHT TO TRAVEL WITHOUT STATE PERMITS </b></font></p>
    <p align="left">By Jack McLamb <font size="-1">(from Aid &amp; Abet Newsletter)</font>
    </p>
    <p>For years professionals within the criminal justice system have acted on 
    the belief that traveling by motor vehicle was a privilege that was given to 
    a citizen only after approval by their state government in the form of a 
    permit or license to drive. In other words, the individual must be granted 
    the privilege before his use of the state highways was considered legal. 
    Legislators, police officers, and court officials are becoming aware that 
    there are court decisions that disprove the belief that driving is a 
    privilege and therefore requires government approval in the form of a 
    license. Presented here are some of these cases: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>CASE #1: &quot;The use of the highway for the purpose of travel and 
      transportation is not a mere privilege, but a common fundamental right of 
      which the public and individuals cannot rightfully be deprived.&quot; <em>
      Chicago Motor Coach v. Chicago, 169 NE 221.</em> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>CASE #2: &quot;The right of the citizen to travel upon the public highways 
      and to transport his property thereon, either by carriage or by 
      automobile, is not a mere privilege which a city may prohibit or permit at 
      will, but a common law right which he has under the right to life, 
      liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot; <em>Thompson v. Smith, 154 SE 579.</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It could not be stated more directly or conclusively that citizens of the 
    states have a common law right to travel, without approval or restriction 
    (license), and that this right is protected under the U.S Constitution. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>CASE #3: &quot;The right to travel is a part of the liberty of which the 
      citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth 
      Amendment.&quot; <em>Kent v. Dulles, 357 US 116, 125.</em> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>CASE #4: &quot;The right to travel is a well-established common right that 
      does not owe its existence to the federal government. It is recognized by 
      the courts as a natural right.&quot; <em>Schactman v. Dulles 96 App DC 287, 225 
      F2d 938, at 941.</em> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As hard as it is for those of us in law enforcement to believe, there is 
    no room for speculation in these court decisions. American citizens do 
    indeed have the inalienable right to use the roadways unrestricted in any 
    manner as long as they are not damaging or violating property or rights of 
    others. Government -- in requiring the people to obtain drivers licenses, 
    and accepting vehicle inspections and DUI/DWI roadblocks without question -- 
    is restricting, and therefore violating, the people's common law right to 
    travel. </p>
    <p>Is this a new legal interpretation on this subject? Apparently not. This 
    means that the beliefs and opinions our state legislators, the courts, and 
    those in law enforcement have acted upon for years have been in error. 
    Researchers armed with actual facts state that case law is overwhelming in 
    determining that to restrict the movement of the individual in the free 
    exercise of his right to travel is a serious breach of those freedoms 
    secured by the U.S. Constitution and most state constitutions. That means it 
    is unlawful. The revelation that the American citizen has always had the 
    inalienable right to travel raises profound questions for those who are 
    involved in making and enforcing state laws. The first of such questions may 
    very well be this: If the states have been enforcing laws that are 
    unconstitutional on their face, it would seem that there must be some way 
    that a state can legally put restrictions -- such as licensing requirements, 
    mandatory insurance, vehicle registration, vehicle inspections to name just 
    a few -- on a citizen's constitutionally protected rights. Is that so? &nbsp; </p>
    <p>For the answer, let us look, once again, to the U.S. courts for a 
    determination of this very issue. In <em>Hertado v. California, 110 US 516,</em> 
    the U.S Supreme Court states very plainly: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;The state cannot diminish rights of the people.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And in <em>Bennett v. Boggs, 1 Baldw 60,</em> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Statutes that violate the plain and obvious principles of common right 
      and common reason are null and void.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Would we not say that these judicial decisions are straight to the point 
    -- that there is no lawful method for government to put restrictions or 
    limitations on rights belonging to the people? Other cases are even more 
    straight forward: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;The assertion of federal rights, when plainly and reasonably made, is 
      not to be defeated under the name of local practice.&quot; <em>Davis v. 
      Wechsler, 263 US 22, at 24</em> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no 
      rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.&quot; <em>Miranda v. 
      Arizona, 384 US 436, 491.</em> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;The claim and exercise of a constitutional right cannot be converted 
      into a crime.&quot; <em>Miller v. US, 230 F 486, at 489.</em> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>There can be no sanction or penalty imposed upon one because of this 
      exercise of constitutional rights.&quot; <em>Sherer v. Cullen, 481 F 946</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We could go on, quoting court decision after court decision; however, the 
    Constitution itself answers our question - Can a government legally put 
    restrictions on the rights of the American people at anytime, for any 
    reason? The answer is found in Article Six of the U.S. Constitution: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be 
      made in Pursuance thereof;...shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the 
      Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the 
      Constitution or laws of any State to the Contrary not one word 
      withstanding.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the same Article, it says just who within our government that is bound 
    by this Supreme Law: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of 
      the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, 
      both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by 
      Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution...&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here's an interesting question. Is ignorance of these laws an excuse for 
    such acts by officials? If we are to follow the letter of the law, (as we 
    are sworn to do), this places officials who involve themselves in such 
    unlawful acts in an unfavorable legal situation. For it is a felony and 
    federal crime to violate or deprive citizens of their constitutionally 
    protected rights. Our system of law dictates that there are only two ways to 
    legally remove a right belonging to the people. These are: </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>by lawfully amending the constitution, or </li>
      <li>by a person knowingly waiving a particular right. </li>
      <li>&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some of the confusion on our present system has arisen because many 
    millions of people have waived their right to travel unrestricted and 
    volunteered into the jurisdiction of the state. Those who have knowingly 
    given up these rights are now legally regulated by state law and must 
    acquire the proper permits and registrations. There are basically two groups 
    of people in this category: </p>

  <br>
  Mr. Johnson,<br>
  <br>
  Free people have a right to travel on the roads that are provided by their servants for
  that purpose, using ordinary
  transportation of the day. Licensing cannot be required of free people because taking on
  the restrictions of a
  license requires the surrender of a right. The drivers license can be required of people
  who use the highways for
  trade, commerce or hire; that is, if they earn their living on the road, and they use
  extraordinary machines on the
  roads. In other words, if you are not using the highways for profit, you cannot be
  required to have a drivers
  license. <br>
  <br>
  Personal liberty consists of the power of locomotion, of changing situations, of removing
  one's person to whatever
  place one's inclination may direct, without imprisonment or restraint unless by due
  process of law. Streets and
  highways are established and maintained for the purpose of travel and transportation by
  the public. Such travel
  may be for business or pleasure. The use of the highways for the purpose of travel and
  transportation is not a mere
  privilege, but a common and fundamental right of which the public and the individual
  cannot be rightfully deprived.<br>
  Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or
  legislation that would
  abrogate them. The claim and exercise of a Constitutional right cannot be converted into a
  crime. There can be no
  sanction or penalty imposed upon one because of this exercise of Constitutional rights. I
  believe a great fraud has
  been perpetrated against the free people of the United States of America. Be advised that
  fraud vitiates the most
  solemn contract.<br>
  <br>
  I do not make my living on the roads. I have never applied for a grant of driving
  privileges from the State of
  Oregon in the form of a license. I was, however, on 10/15/2000, charged with the offense
  of &quot;No Operators
  License&quot;. I was given a summons to appear in the Grants Pass Circuit Court. I was not
  required to sign the
  summons nor did I agree to appear. The state cannot produce any document signed by me
  granting an attachment
  of equity jurisdiction between the United States and me. The Josephine County court,
  without proper jurisdiction,
  has attached a liability to me in the amount of $218.75 and assigned it to the Oregon
  Department of Revenue for
  collection. I am being threatened with the issuance of a distraint warrant. The DMV has
  issued me a license
  number for tracking purposes so they can record a suspension of driving privileges. The
  state has converted my
  Constitutional right into a crime without due process of law. <br>
  <br>
  At this time I respectfully demand that all records involving driving or operating
  privileges, all court records, all
  assignments, liabilities, and warrants having my name on them be destroyed. This
  communication, in addition to
  you, is also being sent to all the major newsgroups on the internet and other groups in
  the United States that are
  actively involved in restoring our sacred liberties that are being taken from us one by
  one by more or less rapid
  encroachment. I believe in the rule of law. I stand firmly against the abrogation of
  NATURAL RIGHTS endowed
  us by our creator. <br>

  This is just my own opinion, &amp; anyone's free to disagree!!!<br>
  The Amish folks don't get drivers licenses, &amp; they use the roadways!! BUT--they don't
  operate lethally dangerous
  iron motor vehicles either! In most states you can also drive a farm tractor on public
  roadways without any sort of
  license!
  They also don't have the EXPENSE of fuel, oil, tires, tune-ups &amp; so forth!
  IF you're going to operate a car or truck, I'd recommend taking the trouble to get a
  license. If you don't want to,
  then why not trade in your car for a horse&amp; buggy, or for a John Deere? </p>
