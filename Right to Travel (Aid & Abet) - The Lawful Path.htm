      <P>DESPITE ACTIONS OF POLICE AND LOCAL COURTS, <BR>HIGHER COURTS HAVE 
      RULED THAT AMERICAN CITIZENS <BR>HAVE A RIGHT TO TRAVEL WITHOUT STATE 
      PERMITS </B></FONT>
      <P>By Jack McLamb <FONT size=-1>(from Aid &amp; Abet Newsletter)</FONT> 
      </CENTER>
      <P>For years professionals within the criminal justice system have acted 
      on the belief that traveling by motor vehicle was a privilege that was 
      given to a citizen only after approval by their state government in the 
      form of a permit or license to drive. In other words, the individual must 
      be granted the privilege before his use of the state highways was 
      considered legal. Legislators, police officers, and court officials are 
      becoming aware that there are court decisions that disprove the belief 
      that driving is a privilege and therefore requires government approval in 
      the form of a license. Presented here are some of these cases: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>CASE #1: "The use of the highway for the purpose of travel 
        and transportation is not a mere privilege, but a common fundamental 
        right of which the public and individuals cannot rightfully be 
        deprived." <EM>Chicago Motor Coach v. Chicago, 169 NE 221.</EM> 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>CASE #2: "The right of the citizen to travel upon the public 
        highways and to transport his property thereon, either by carriage or by 
        automobile, is not a mere privilege which a city may prohibit or permit 
        at will, but a common law right which he has under the right to life, 
        liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." <EM>Thompson v. Smith, 154 SE 
        579.</EM> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>It could not be stated more directly or conclusively that citizens of 
      the states have a common law right to travel, without approval or 
      restriction (license), and that this right is protected under the U.S 
      Constitution. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>CASE #3: "The right to travel is a part of the liberty of 
        which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under 
        the Fifth Amendment." <EM>Kent v. Dulles, 357 US 116, 125.</EM> 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>CASE #4: "The right to travel is a well-established common 
        right that does not owe its existence to the federal government. It is 
        recognized by the courts as a natural right." <EM>Schactman v. Dulles 96 
        App DC 287, 225 F2d 938, at 941.</EM> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>As hard as it is for those of us in law enforcement to believe, there 
      is no room for speculation in these court decisions. American citizens do 
      indeed have the inalienable right to use the roadways unrestricted in any 
      manner as long as they are not damaging or violating property or rights of 
      others. Government -- in requiring the people to obtain drivers licenses, 
      and accepting vehicle inspections and DUI/DWI roadblocks without question 
      -- is restricting, and therefore violating, the people's common law right 
      to travel. 
      <P>Is this a new legal interpretation on this subject? Apparently not. 
      This means that the beliefs and opinions our state legislators, the 
      courts, and those in law enforcement have acted upon for years have been 
      in error. Researchers armed with actual facts state that case law is 
      overwhelming in determining that to restrict the movement of the 
      individual in the free exercise of his right to travel is a serious breach 
      of those freedoms secured by the U.S. Constitution and most state 
      constitutions. That means it is unlawful. The revelation that the American 
      citizen has always had the inalienable right to travel raises profound 
      questions for those who are involved in making and enforcing state laws. 
      The first of such questions may very well be this: If the states have been 
      enforcing laws that are unconstitutional on their face, it would seem that 
      there must be some way that a state can legally put restrictions -- such 
      as licensing requirements, mandatory insurance, vehicle registration, 
      vehicle inspections to name just a few -- on a citizen's constitutionally 
      protected rights. Is that so? 
      <P>For the answer, let us look, once again, to the U.S. courts for a 
      determination of this very issue. In <EM>Hertado v. California, 110 US 
      516,</EM> the U.S Supreme Court states very plainly: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"The state cannot diminish rights of the people." 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>And in <EM>Bennett v. Boggs, 1 Baldw 60,</EM> 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"Statutes that violate the plain and obvious principles of 
        common right and common reason are null and void." </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Would we not say that these judicial decisions are straight to the 
      point -- that there is no lawful method for government to put restrictions 
      or limitations on rights belonging to the people? Other cases are even 
      more straight forward: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"The assertion of federal rights, when plainly and 
        reasonably made, is not to be defeated under the name of local 
        practice." <EM>Davis v. Wechsler, 263 US 22, at 24</EM> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, 
        there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them." 
        <EM>Miranda v. Arizona, 384 US 436, 491.</EM> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"The claim and exercise of a constitutional right cannot be 
        converted into a crime." <EM>Miller v. US, 230 F 486, at 489.</EM> 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>There can be no sanction or penalty imposed upon one because 
        of this exercise of constitutional rights." <EM>Sherer v. Cullen, 481 F 
        946</EM> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>We could go on, quoting court decision after court decision; however, 
      the Constitution itself answers our question - Can a government legally 
      put restrictions on the rights of the American people at anytime, for any 
      reason? The answer is found in Article Six of the U.S. Constitution: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which 
        shall be made in Pursuance thereof;...shall be the supreme Law of the 
        Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in 
        the Constitution or laws of any State to the Contrary not one word 
        withstanding." </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>In the same Article, it says just who within our government that is 
      bound by this Supreme Law: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the 
        Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and 
        judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, 
        shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution..." 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Here's an interesting question. Is ignorance of these laws an excuse 
      for such acts by officials? If we are to follow the letter of the law, (as 
      we are sworn to do), this places officials who involve themselves in such 
      unlawful acts in an unfavorable legal situation. For it is a felony and 
      federal crime to violate or deprive citizens of their constitutionally 
      protected rights. Our system of law dictates that there are only two ways 
      to legally remove a right belonging to the people. These are: 
      <OL type=1>
        <LI>by lawfully amending the constitution, or 
        <LI>by a person knowingly waiving a particular right. </LI></OL>
      <P>Some of the confusion on our present system has arisen because many 
      millions of people have waived their right to travel unrestricted and 
      volunteered into the jurisdiction of the state. Those who have knowingly 
      given up these rights are now legally regulated by state law and must 
      acquire the proper permits and registrations. There are basically two 
      groups of people in this category: 
      <OL type=1>
        <LI>Citizens who involve themselves in commerce upon the highways of the 
        state. Here is what the courts have said about this: "...For while a 
        citizen has the right to travel upon the public highways and to 
        transport his property thereon, that right does not extend to the use of 
        the highways...as a place for private gain. For the latter purpose, no 
        person has a vested right to use the highways of this state, but it is a 
        privilege...which the (state) may grant or withhold at its 
        discretion..." <EM>State v. Johnson, 245 P 1073.</EM> There are many 
        court cases that confirm and point out the difference between the right 
        of the citizen to travel and a government privilege and there are 
        numerous other court decisions that spell out the jurisdiction issue in 
        these two distinctly different activities. However, because of space 
        restrictions, we will leave it to officers to research it further for 
        themselves. 
        <LI>The second group of citizens that is legally under the jurisdiction 
        of the state are those citizens who have voluntarily and knowingly 
        waived their right to travel unregulated and unrestricted by requesting 
        placement under such jurisdiction through the acquisition of a state 
        driver's license, vehicle registration, mandatory insurance, etc. (In 
        other words, by contract.) We should remember what makes this legal and 
        not a violation of the common law right to travel is that they knowingly 
        volunteer by contract to waive their rights. If they were forced, 
        coerced or unknowingly placed under the state's powers, the courts have 
        said it is a clear violation of their rights. This in itself raises a 
        very interesting question. What percentage of the people in each state 
        have applied for and received licenses, registrations and obtained 
        insurance after erroneously being advised by their government that it 
        was mandatory? </LI></OL>
      <P>Many of our courts, attorneys and police officials are just becoming 
      informed about this important issue and the difference between privileges 
      and rights. We can assume that the majority of those Americans carrying 
      state licenses and vehicle registrations have no knowledge of the rights 
      they waived in obeying laws such as these that the U.S. Constitution 
      clearly states are unlawful, i.e. laws of no effect - laws that are not 
      laws at all. An area of serious consideration for every police officer is 
      to understand that the most important law in our land which he has taken 
      an oath to protect, defend, and enforce, is not state laws and city or 
      county ordinances, but the law that supersedes all other laws -- the U.S. 
      Constitution. If laws in a particular state or local community conflict 
      with the supreme law of our nation, there is no question that the 
      officer's duty is to uphold the U.S. Constitution. 
      <P>Every police officer should keep the following U.S. court ruling -- 
      discussed earlier -- in mind before issuing citations concerning 
      licensing, registration, and insurance: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>"The claim and exercise of a constitutional right cannot be 
        converted into a crime." <EM>Miller v. US, 230 F 486, 489.</EM> 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>And as we have seen, traveling freely, going about one's daily 
      activities, is the exercise of a most basic right.
