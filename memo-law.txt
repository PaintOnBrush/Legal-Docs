     carriage or other contrivance propelled or drawn
     by mechanical power and used for commercial
     purposes on the highways in transportation of

     any fare, fee, rate, charge or other
     consideration, or directly or indirectly in
     connection with any business, or other
     undertaking intended for profit[.]"  18 U.S.C. 

                       CONCLUSION

     Is an automobile always a vehicle (or motor vehicle)? 
No.
     This is a question of fact that turns on the use to
which the automobile in question is put (i.e., either
personal or commercial).  While the presumption of an
automobile being a vehicle (or motor vehicle) is created by
the owner of said automobile registering same with the
state as a vehicle, this presumption may be overcome by an
affirmative defense to the allegation of the automobile
being a vehicle, baring any evidence to the contrary
indicating commercial use.

                                  Respectfully submitted,
