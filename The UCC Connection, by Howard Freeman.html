				<h2 align="center">FOREWORD</h2>
				<p class="auto-style1">This is slightly condensed, casually paraphrased
				transcript of tapes of a seminar given in 1990 by Howard Freeman.
				It was prepared to make available the knowledge and experience of
				Mr. Freeman in his search for an accessible and understandable explanation
				of the confusing state of the government and the courts. It should
				be helpful to those who may have difficulty learning from such lectures,
				or those who want to develop a deeper understanding of this information
				without having to listen to three or four hours of recorded material.
				</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">The frustration many Americans feel about
				our judicial system can be overwhelming and often frightening; and
				like most fear, eventually, with the seemingly tyrannical power
				of some governmental agency and the mystifying and awesome power
				of the courts. We have been taught that we must &quot;get a good lawyer,&quot;
				but that is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible.
				If we are defending ourselves from the government, we find that
				the lawyers quickly take our money, and then tell us as the ship
				is sinking, &quot;I can&#39;t help you with that - I&#39;m an officer of the
				court.&quot; </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Ultimately, the only way for us to have even
				a &quot;snowball&#39;s chance &#8230;&quot; is to understand the RULES OF THE GAME,
				and to come to an understanding of the true nature of the Law. The
				attorney lawyers have established and secured a virtual monopoly
				over this area of human knowledge by implying that the subject is
				just too difficult for the average person to understand, and by
				creating a separate vocabulary out of English words of otherwise
				common usage. While it may, at times, seem hopelessly complicated,
				it is not that difficult to grasp - are lawyers really as smart
				as they would have us believe? Besides, anyone who has been through
				a legal battle against the government with the aid of a lawyer has
				come to realize that lawyers learn about procedure, not about law.
				Mr. Freeman admits that he is not a lawyer, and as much, he has
				a way of explaining law to us that puts it well within our reach.
				Consider also that the framers of the Constitution wrote in language
				simple enough that the people could understand, specifically so
				that it would not have to be interpreted. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">So again we find, as in many other areas
				of life, that &quot;THE BUCK STOPS HERE!&quot; It is we who must take the
				responsibility for finding and putting to good use the TRUTH. It
				is we who must claim and defend our God-given rights and our freedom
				from those who would take from us. It is we who must protect ourselves,
				our families and our posterity from the inevitable intrusion into
				our lives by those who live parasitically off the labor, skill and
				talents of others. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">To these ends, Mr. Freeman offers a simple,
				hopeful explanation of our plight and a peaceful method of dealing
				with it. Please take note that this lecture represents one chapter
				in the book of his understanding, which he is always refining, expanding,
				improving. It is, as all bits of wisdom are, a point of departure
				from which to begin our own journey into understanding, that we
				all might be able to pass on to others; greater knowledge and hope,
				and to God: the gift of lives in peace, freedom and praise. </p>
				<p>&quot;<b><i>I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, be wise
				as a serpent and harmless as a dove.</i></b>&quot; </p>
				<h2 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h2>
				<p class="auto-style1">I was asked to testify in a tax case as an
				expert witness. After many days of preparation, I felt confident
				of my research. I spent over 30 minutes presenting many Supreme
				Court decisions that supported the defendant&#39;s position. The prosecution
				concluded his statements, and to my amazement, the judge told the
				jury that they could only consider certain facts, none of which
				were the facts I had given. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">As soon as the trial was over I went around
				to the judge&#39;s office and he was just coming in through his back
				door. I said, &quot;Judge, by what authority do you overturn the standing
				decisions of the United States Supreme Court. You sat on the bench
				while I read that case law. Now how do you, a District Judge, have
				authority to overturn decisions of the Supreme Court?&quot; He says.
				&quot;Oh, those were old decisions.&quot; I said, &quot;Those are standing decisions.
				They have never been overturned. I don&#39;t care how old they are;
				you have no right to overturn a standing decision of the United
				States Supreme Court in a District Court.&quot; </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b>PUBLIC LAW V. PUBLIC POLICY </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">He said, &quot;Name any decision of the Supreme
				Court after 1938 and I&#39;ll honor it, but all the decision you read
				were prior to 1938, and I don&#39;t honor those decisions.&quot; I asked
				what happened in 1938. He said, &quot;Prior to 1938, the Supreme Court
				was dealing with Public Law; since 1938, the Supreme Court has dealt
				with Public Policy. The charge that Mr. S. was being tried for is
				a Public Policy Statute, not Public Law, and those Supreme Court
				cases do not apply to Public Policy.&quot; I asked him what happened
				in 1938? He said that he had already told me too much - he wasn&#39;t
				going to tell me any more. </p>
				<p><b>1938 AND THE ERIE RAILROAD </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Well, I began to investigate. I found that
				1938 was the year of the Erie Railroad v. Tompkins case of the Supreme
				Court. It was also the year the courts claim they blended Law with
				Equity. I read the Erie Railroad case. A man had sued the Erie Railroad
				for damages when he was struck by a board sticking out of a boxcar
				as he walked along beside the tracks. The district court had decided
				on the basis of Commercial (Negotiable Instruments) Law: that this
				man was not under any contract with the Erie Railroad, and therefore
				he had no standing to sue the company. Under the Common Law, he
				was damaged and he would have had the right to sue. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">This overturned a standing decision of over
				one hundred years. Swift v. Tyson in 1840 was a similar case, and
				the decision of the Supreme Court was that in any case of this type,
				the court would judge the case on the Common Law of the state where
				the incident occurred - in this case Pennsylvania. But in the Erie
				Railroad case, the Supreme Court ruled that all federal cases will
				be judged under the Negotiable Instruments Law. There would be no
				more decisions based on the Common Law at the federal level. So
				here we find the blending of Law with Equity. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">This was a puzzle to me. As I put these new
				pieces together, I determined that all our courts since 1938 were
				Merchant Law courts and not Common Law courts. There were still
				some pieces of the puzzle missing. </p>
				<p><b>A FRIEND IN THE COURT </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Fortunately, I made a friend of a judge.
				Now you won&#39;t make friends with a judge if you go into court like
				a &quot;wolf in black sheep country.&quot; You must approach him as though
				you are the sheep and he is the wolf. If you go into court as a
				wolf, you make demands and tell the judge what the law is - how
				he had better uphold the law or else. Remember the verse: I send
				you out as sheep in wolf country; be wise as a serpent and harmless
				as a dove. We have to go into court and be wise and harmless, and
				not make demands. We must play a little dumb and ask a lot of questions.
				Well, I asked a lot of questions and boxed the judges into a corner
				where they had to give me a victory or admit what they didn&#39;t want
				to admit. I won the case, and on the way out I had to stop by the
				clerk&#39;s office to get some papers. One of the judges stopped and
				said, &quot;You&#39;re an interesting man, Mr. Freeman. If you&#39;re ever in
				town, stop by, and if I&#39;m not sitting on a case we will visit.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p><b>AMERICA IS BANKRUPT </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Later, when I went to visit the judge, I
				told him of my problem with the Supreme Court cases dealing with
				Public Policy rather than the Public Law. He said, &quot;In 1938, all
				the higher judges, the top attorneys and the U.S. attorneys were
				called into a secret meeting and this is what we were told: </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">America is a bankrupt nation - it is owned
				completely by its creditors. The creditors own the Congress, they
				own the Executive, they own the Judiciary and they own all the state
				governments.</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Take silent judicial notice of this fact,
				but never reveal it openly. Your court is operating in an Admiralty
				Jurisdiction - call it anything you want, but do not call it Admiralty.
				</p>
				<p><b>ADMIRALTY COURTS</b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">The reason they cannot call it Admiralty
				Jurisdiction is that your defense would be quite different in Admiralty
				Jurisdiction from your defense under the Common Law. In Admiralty,
				there is no court which has jurisdiction unless there is a valid
				international contract in dispute. If you know it is Admiralty Jurisdiction,
				and they have admitted on the record that you are in Admiralty Court,
				you can demand that the international maritime contract, to which
				you are supposedly a party, and which you supposedly have breached,
				be placed into evidence. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">No court has Admiralty/Maritime Jurisdiction
				unless there is a valid international maritime contract that has
				been breached. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">So you say, just innocently like a lamb,
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					&#8220;<b><i>Well, I didn&#39;t know that I got involved with an international
					maritime contract, so, in good faith, I deny that such a contract
					exists. If this court is taking jurisdiction in Admiralty, then,
					pursuant to section 3-501 of your UCC, (Presentment), the prosecutor
					will have no difficulty placing the [alleged] contract into
					evidence, so that I may examine and [possibly] challenge the
					validity of the contract</i></b>.&#8221;</blockquote>
				<p class="auto-style1">What they would have to do is place the national
				debt into evidence. They would have to admit that the international
				bankers own the whole nation, and that we are their slaves. </p>
				<p><b>NOT EXPEDIENT </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">But the bankers said it is not expedient
				at this time to admit that they own everything and could foreclose
				on every nation of the world. The reason they don&#39;t want to tell
				everyone that they own everything is that there are still too many
				privately owned guns. There are uncooperative armies and other military
				forces. So until they can gradually consolidate all armies into
				a WORLD ARMY and all courts into a single WORLD COURT, it is not
				expedient to admit the jurisdiction the courts are operating under.
				When we understand these things, we realize that there are certain
				secrets they don&#39;t want to admit, and we can use this to our benefit.
				</p>
				<h2 align="center">JURISDICTION</h2>
				<p class="auto-style1">The Constitution of the United States mentions
				three areas of jurisdiction in which the courts may operate: </p>
				<h2 align="center">Common Law</h2>
				<p class="auto-style1">Common Law is based on God&#39;s law. Anytime
				someone is charged under the Common Law, there must be a damaged
				party. You are free under the Common Law to do anything you please,
				as long as you do not infringe on the life, liberty, or property
				of someone else. You have a right to make a fool of yourself provided
				you do not infringe on the life, liberty, or property of someone
				else. The Common Law does not allow for any government action which
				prevents a man from making a fool of himself. For instance, when
				you cross over the state lines in most states, you will see a sign
				which says, &quot; BUCKLE YOUR SEAT BELTS - IT&#39;S THE LAW. &quot; This cannot
				be Common Law, because who would you injure if you did not buckle
				up? Nobody. This would be compelled performance. But Common Law
				cannot compel performance. Any violation of Common Law is a CRIMINAL
				ACT , and is punishable. </p>
				<h2 align="center">Equity Law</h2>
				<p class="auto-style1">Equity Law is law which compels performance.
				It compels you to perform to the exact letter of any contract that
				you are under. So, if you have compelled performance, there must
				be a contract somewhere, and you are being compelled to perform
				under the obligation of the contract. Now this can only be a civil
				action - not criminal. In Equity Jurisdiction, you cannot be tried
				criminally, but you can be compelled to perform to the letter of
				a contract. If you then refuse to perform as directed by the court,
				you can be charged with contempt of court, which is a criminal action.
				Are our seatbelt laws, Equity Laws? No, they are not, because you
				cannot be penalized or punished for not keeping to the letter of
				a contract. </p>
				<h2 id="main" align="center">Admiralty/Maritime Laws</h2>
				<p class="auto-style1">This is civil jurisdiction of Compelled Performance
				which also has Criminal Penalties for not adhering to the letter
				of the contract, but this only applies to International Contracts.
				Now we can see what jurisdiction the seatbelt laws (all traffic
				codes, etc) are under. Whenever there is a penalty for failure to
				perform (such as willful failure to file), that is Admiralty/Maritime
				Law and there must be a valid international contract in force.</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">However, the courts don&#39;t want to admit that
				they are operating under Admiralty/Maritime Jurisdictions, so they
				took the international law or Law Merchant and adopted it into our
				codes. That is what the Supreme Court decided in the Erie Railroad
				case - that the decisions will be based on commercial law or business
				law and that it will have criminal penalties associated with it.
				Since they were instructed not to call it, Admiralty Jurisdiction,
				they call it Statutory Jurisdiction. </p>
				<p><b>COURTS OF CONTRACT </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">You must ask how we got into this situation
				where we can be charged with failure to wear seatbelts and be fined
				for it. Isn&#39;t the judge sworn to up hold the Constitution? Yes,
				he is. But you must understand the Constitution, in Article I, §
				10, gives us the unlimited right to contract, as long as we do not
				infringe on the life, liberty or property of someone else. Contracts
				are enforceable, and the Constitution gives two jurisdictions where
				contracts can be enforced - Equity or Admiralty. But we find them
				being in Statutory Jurisdiction. This is the embarrassing part for
				the courts, but we can use this to box the judges into a corner
				in their own courts. We will cover this more later. </p>
				<p><b>CONTRACTS MUST BE VOLUNTARY </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Under the Common Law, every contract must
				be enter into knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally by both
				parties or it is void and enforceable. These are characteristic
				-it must be based on substance. For example, contracts used to read,
				&quot;For one dollar and other valuable considerations, I will paint
				your house, etc. That was a valid contract - the dollar was a genuine,
				silver dollar. Now, suppose you wrote a contract that said, &quot;For
				one Federal Reserve Note and other considerations, I will paint
				your house....&quot; And suppose, for example, I painted your house the
				wrong color. Could you go into a Common Law court and get justice?
				No, you could not. You see, a Federal Reserve Note is a &quot;colorable&quot;1
				dollar, as it has no substance, and in a Common Law Jurisdiction,
				that contract would be unenforceable. </p>
				<p><b>colorABLE MONEY - colorABLE COURTS </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">The word &quot;colorable&quot; means something that
				appears to be genuine, but is not. Maybe it looks like a dollar,
				and maybe it spends like a dollar, but if it is not redeemable for
				lawful money (silver or gold) it is &quot;colorable.&quot; If a Federal Reserve
				Note is used in a contract, then the contract becomes a &quot;colorable&quot;
				contract. And &quot;colorable&quot; contracts must be enforced under a &quot;colorable&quot;
				jurisdiction. So by creating Federal Reserve Notes, the government
				had to create a jurisdiction to cover the kinds of contracts which
				use them. We now have what is called Statutory Jurisdiction, which
				is not a genuine Admiralty jurisdiction. </p>
				<p class="auto-style2">1 colorable: That which is in appearance
				only, and not in reality, what it purports to be, hence counterfeit,
				<br>feigned have the appearance of truth. Black&#39;s Law Dictionary,
				Sixth Edition. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">It is &quot; colorable &quot; Admiralty Jurisdiction
				the judges are enforcing because we are using &quot; colorable money
				.&quot; colorable Admiralty is now known as Statutory Jurisdiction. Let&#39;s
				see how we got under this Statutory Jurisdiction. </p>
				<p><b>UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">The government set up a &quot;colorable&quot; law system
				to fit the &quot;colorable&quot; currency. It used to be called the Law Merchant
				or the Law of redeemable Instruments, because it dealt with paper
				which was redeemable in something of substance. But, once Federal
				Reserve Notes had become unredeemable, there had to be a system
				of law which was completely &quot;colorable&quot; from start to finish. this
				system of law was codified as the Uniform Commercial Code , and
				has been adopted in every state. This is &quot;colorable&quot; law, and it
				is used in all the courts. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">I explained one of the keys earlier, which
				is that the country is bankrupt and we have no rights. If the master
				says &quot;Jump!&quot; then the slave had better jump, because the master
				has the right to cut off his head. As slaves we have no rights.
				But the creditors/masters had to cover that up, so they created
				a system of law called the Uniform Commercial Code. This &quot;colorable&quot;
				jurisdiction under the Uniform Commercial Code is the next key to
				understanding what happened. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b>CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">One difference between Common Law and the
				Uniform Commercial Code is that in Common Law, contracts must be
				entered into (1) knowingly, (2) voluntarily, and (3) intentionally.
				</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Under the U.C.C., this is not so. First of
				all, contracts are unnecessary. Under this new law, &quot;agreements&quot;
				can be binding, and if you only exercise the benefits of an &quot;agreements,&quot;
				it is presumed or implied that you intend to meet the obligations
				associated with those benefits. If you accept a benefit offered
				by government, then you are obligated to follow, to the letter,
				each and every statute involved with that benefit. The method has
				been to get everyone exercising a benefit , and they don&#39;t even
				have to tell the people what the benefit is. Some people think it
				is the driver&#39;s license, the marriage license or the birth certificate,
				etc. I believe it is none of these. </p>
				<p><b>COMPELLED BENEFIT </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">I believe the benefit being used is that
				we have been given the privilege of discharging debt with limited
				liability, instead of paying debt. When we pay a debt, we give substance
				for substance. If I buy a quart of milk with a silver dollar, that
				dollar bought the milk, and the milk bought the dollar - substance
				for substance. But if I use a Federal Reserve Note to buy the milk,
				I have not paid for it. There is no substance in the Federal Reserve
				Note. It is worthless paper given in exchange for something of substantive
				value. Congress offers us this benefit : </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Debt money, created by the federal United
				States, can be spent all over the United States of America, it will
				be legal tender for all debts, public and private, and the limited
				liability is that you cannot be sued for not paying your debt.
				</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">So now they have said, &quot;We going to help
				you out, and you can just discharge your debts instead of paying
				your debts.&quot; When we use this &quot;colorable&quot; money to discharge our
				debts, we cannot use a Common Law court. We can only use a &quot;colorable&quot;
				court. We are completely under the UCC, using non-redeemable negotiable
				instruments and we are discharging debt rather than paying debt.
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2 align="center">REMEDY AND RECOURSE </h2>
				<p class="auto-style1">Every system of civilized law must have two
				characteristics: Remedy and Recourse. Remedy is a way to get out
				from under that law, and you recover your loss. The Common Law,
				the Law Merchants, and even the Uniform Commercial Code all have
				remedy and recourse, but for a long time we could not find them.
				If you go to a law library and ask to see the Uniform Commercial
				Code, they will show you a shelf of books completely filled with
				the Uniform Commercial Code. When you pick up one volume and start
				to read it, it will seem to have been intentionally written to be
				confusing. It took us a long time to discover where the Remedy and
				Recourse are found in their UCC. They are found right in the first
				volume, at 1-308 (old 1-207) and 1-103. </p>
				<p><b>REMEDY </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">The making of a valid Reservation of Rights
				preserves whatever rights the person then possesses, and prevents
				the loss of such rights by application of concepts of waiver or
				estoppel. (UCC 1-308 (old 1-207).7)</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">It is important to remember when we go into
				a court that we are in a commercial international jurisdiction.
				If we go into court and say, &quot; I DEMAND MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS
				,&quot; the judge will most likely say, &quot;You mention the Constitution
				again, and I&#39;ll find you in contempt of court !&quot; Then we don&#39;t understand
				how he can do that. Hasn&#39;t he sworn to uphold the Constitution?
				The rule here is: you cannot be charged under one jurisdiction,
				and defend under another. For example, if the French government
				came to you and asked where you filed your French income tax in
				a certain year, do you go to the French government and say, &quot;I demand
				my Constitutional Right?&quot; No. The proper answer is: THE LAW DOESN&#39;T
				APPLY TO ME - I&#39;M NOT A FRENCHMAN. You must make your reservation
				of rights under the jurisdiction in which you are charged - not
				under some other jurisdiction. So in a UCC court, you must claim
				your reservation of rights under (pursuant to) the [their] U.C.C.
				1-308 (old 1-207). </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">UCC 1-308 (old 1-207) goes on to say: </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">When a waivable right or claim is involved,
				the failure to make a reservation thereof, causes a loss of the
				right, and bars its assertion at a later date . (UCC 1-308 (old
				1-207).9) </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">You have to make your claim known early.
				Further, it says: </p>
				<p>The Sufficiency of the Reservation - Any expression indicating
				an intention to reserve rights, is sufficient,<br>such as &quot;WITHOUT
				PREJUDICE.&quot; <span class="auto-style4">(UCC 1-308 (old 1-207).4)</span></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Whenever you sign any legal paper that deals
				with Federal Reserve Notes (FRNs) -in any way, shape or manner -
				under your signature write: Without Prejudice UCC 1-308 (old 1-207).
				This reserves your rights. You can show, at 1-308 (old 1-207).4
				that you have sufficiently reserved your rights.</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">It is very important to understand just what
				this means. For example, one man who used this in regard to a traffic
				ticket was asked by the judge just what he meant by writing &quot;without
				prejudice UCC 1-308 (old 1-207)&quot; on his statement to the court.
				He had not tried to understand the concepts involved. He only wanted
				to use it to get out of the ticket. He did not know what it meant.
				When the judge asked him what he meant by signing in that way, he
				told the judge that he was not prejudiced against anyone .... The
				judge knew that the man had no idea what it meant, and fined him
				an additional $25.00 for a frivolous defense. You must know what
				it means. </p>
				<p align="center" style="font-family: &quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">
				WITHOUT PREJUDICE<br>pursuant to UCC 1-308</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">When you see &quot;Without Prejudice&quot; UCC 1-308
				in connection with your signature, you are saying: </p>
				<blockquote>
					&quot;<strong>I</strong><em><strong> reserve my right not to be compelled
					to perform under any contract, commercial agreement or bankruptcy
					that I did not enter knowingly , voluntarily , and intentionally
					. And furthermore, I do not and will not accept the liability
					of the compelled benefit of any unrevealed contract or commercial
					agreement or bankruptcy.</strong></em>&quot;<br><br>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="auto-style1">Actually, it is better to use a rubber stamp,
				because this demonstrates that you had previously reserved your
				rights. The simple fact that it takes several days or a week to
				order and get a stamp shows that you had reserved your rights before
				signing the document. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">What is the compelled performance of an unrevealed
				commercial agreement? When you use Federal Reserve Notes instead
				of silver dollars, is it voluntary? No. There is no lawful money
				, so you have to use Federal Reserve Notes - you have to accept
				the benefit. the government has given you the benefit to discharge
				your debts with limited liability, and you don&#39;t have to pay your
				debts. How nice they are! But if you did not reserve your rights
				under 1-308 (old 1-207).7, you are compelled to accept the benefit,
				and are therefore obligated to obey every statute , ordinance and
				regulation of the government, at all levels of government - federal,
				state and local. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">If you understand this, you will be asked
				to explain it to the judge when asks. And he will ask, so be prepared
				to explain it to the court. You will also need to understand UCC
				1-103 - the argument and recourse. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">If you want to understand this fully, go
				to a law library and photocopy these two sections from the UCC.
				It is important to get the Anderson <span class="auto-style3">
				<span class="auto-style4">[Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code, Lawyers
				Cooperative Publishing Company]</span> </span>edition. Some of the
				law libraries will only have the West Publishing version, and it
				is very difficult to understand. In Anderson, it is broken down
				with decimals into ten parts, and most importantly, it is written
				in plain English. </p>
				<p><b>RECOURSE</b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">The Recourse appears in the Uniform Commercial
				Code at 1-103.6, which says: </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">The Code is complimentary to the Common Law,
				which remains in force , except where displaced by the code. A statute
				should be construed in harmony with the Common Law, unless there
				is a clear legislative intent to abrogate the Common Law . </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">This is the argument we use in court: </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">The Code recognizes the Common Law. If it
				did not recognize the Common Law, the government would have had
				to admit that the United States is bankrupt, and is completely owned
				by its creditors. But, it is not expedient to admit this, so the
				Code was written so as not to abolish the Common Law entirely.</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;Therefore, if you have made a sufficient,
				timely, and explicit reservation of your rights at 1-308 (old 1-207),
				you may then insist that the statutes be construed in harmony with
				the Common Law. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">If the charge is a traffic, you may demand
				that the court produce the injured person who has filed a verified
				complaint. If, for example, you were charged with failure to buckle
				your seatbelt , you may ask the court who was injured as a result
				of your failure to &quot;buckle up.&quot; </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">However, if the judge won&#39;t listen to you
				and just moves ahead with the case, then you will want to read to
				him that last sentence of 1-103.6 which states: </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">The Code cannot be read to preclude a Common
				Law action. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Tell the judge: </p>
				<blockquote class="auto-style1">
					&quot;Your Honor, I can sue you under the Common Law, for violating
					my right under the Uniform Commercial Code.&quot; I have a remedy,
					under the, UCC to reserve my rights under the Common Law. I
					have exercised the remedy, and now you must construe this statute
					in harmony with the Common Law, you must come forth with the
					damaged party.&quot;<br>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="auto-style1">If the judge insists on proceeding with the
				case, just act confused and ask this question: </p>
				<blockquote class="auto-style1">
					&quot;Let me see if I understand, Your Honor. Has this court made
					a judicial determination that the sections 1-308 (old 1-207)
					and 1-103 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which is the system
					of law you are operating under, are not valid law before this
					court?&quot; <br><br>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="auto-style1">Now the judge is in a jamb! How can the court
				throw out one part of the Code and uphold another? If he answers,
				&quot;yes,&quot; then you say: </p>
				<blockquote class="auto-style1">
					&quot;I put this court on notice that I am appealing your judicial
					determination.&quot;<br>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="auto-style1">Of course, the higher court will uphold the
				Code on appeal. The judge knows this, so once again you have boxed
				him into a corner. </p>
				<p><b>PRACTICAL APPLICATION - TRAFFIC COURT </b></p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Just so we can understand how this whole
				process works, let us look at a court situation such as a traffic
				violation. Assume you ran through a yellow light and a policeman
				gave you a traffic ticket. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">1. The first thing you want to do is to delay
				the action at least three weeks. This you can do by being pleasant
				and cooperative with the officer. Explain to him that you are very
				busy and ask if he could please set your court appearance for about
				three weeks away. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">[At this point we need to remember the government&#39;s
				trick: &quot;I&#39;m from the government, and I&#39;m here to help you.&quot; Now
				we want to use this approach with them). </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">2. The next step is to go the clerk of the
				traffic court and say: </p>
				<blockquote class="auto-style1">
					&quot;I believe it would be helpful if I talk to you, because I want
					to save the government some money (this will get their attention).
					I am undoubtedly going to appeal this case. As you know, in
					an appeal, I have to have a transcript, but the traffic court
					doesn&#39;t have a court reporter. It would be a waste of taxpayer&#39;s
					money to run me through this court and then to have to give
					me a trial de novo in a court of record. I do need a transcript
					for appealing, and to save the government some money, maybe
					you could schedule me to appear in a court of record.&quot; <br>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="auto-style1">You can show the date on the ticket and the
				clerk will usually agree that there is plenty of time to schedule
				your trial for a court of record. Now your first appearance is in
				a court of record and not in a traffic court, where there is no
				record. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">3. When you get into court, the judge will
				read the charges: driving through a yellow light or whatever, and
				this is a violation of ordinance XYZ. He will ask, &quot; Do you understand
				the charges against you ?&quot; </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">4. It is very important to get it read into
				the record, that you do not understand the charges. With that in
				the record, the court cannot move forward to judge the facts. This
				will be answered later. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">5. &quot;Well, Your Honor, there is a question
				I would like to ask before I can make a plea of innocent or guilty.
				I think it could be answered if I could put the officer on the stand
				for a moment and ask him a few short questions. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Judge: &quot;I don&#39;t see why not. Let&#39;s swear
				the officer in and have him take the stand.&quot; </p>
				<blockquote class="auto-style1">
&nbsp;&quot;Is this the instrument that you gave me?&quot; (Handing him the traffic citation).<br>
					<br>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="auto-style1">Officer: &quot;Yes, this is a copy of it. The
				judge has the other portion of it.&quot; </p>
				<blockquote class="auto-style1">
					&quot;Where did you get my address that you wrote on that citation?&quot;<br>
					<br>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="auto-style1">Officer: &quot;Well, I got it from your driver&#39;s
				license.&quot; </p>
				<blockquote class="auto-style1">
					(Handing the officer your driver&#39;s license) &quot;Is this the document
					you copied my name and address from?&quot;<br>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="auto-style1">Officer: &quot;Yes, this is where I got it.&quot;
				</p>
				<blockquote class="auto-style1">
					&quot;While you&#39;ve got it in your hand, would you read the signature
					that&#39;s on that license? (The officer reads the signature). &quot;While
					you&#39;re there, would you read into the record what it says under
					the signature?&quot; <br>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="auto-style1">Officer: &quot;It says, &quot;Without Prejudice, UCC
				1-308.&quot; [old 1-207] </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Judge: &quot;Let me see that license!&quot; (He looks
				at it turns to the officer). &quot;You didn&#39;t notice this printing under
				the signature on this license, when you copied his name and address
				onto the ticket?&quot; </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Officer: &quot;Oh, no, I was just getting the
				address - I didn&#39;t look down there.&quot; </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Judge: &quot;You&#39;re not very observant as an officer.
				Therefore, I&#39;m afraid I cannot accept your testimony in regards
				to the facts of this case. This case is dismissed.&quot;</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">6.a. you had reserved your Common Law rights
				under the UCC; </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">b. you had done it sufficiently by writing
				&quot;Without Prejudice, UCC 1-308 (old 1-207)&quot; on your driver&#39;s license;</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">c. the statute would now have to be read
				on harmony with the Common Law, and the Common Law says the statute
				exists, but there is no injured party; and </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">d. since there is no injured party or complaining
				witness, the court has no jurisdiction under the Common Law. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">5. If the judge tries to move ahead and try
				the facts of the case, then you will want to ask him the following
				question: </p>
				<blockquote class="auto-style1">
					&quot;Your Honor, let me understand this correctly, has the court
					made a judicial determination that it has authority under the
					jurisdiction that it is operating under, to ignore two sections
					of the Uniform Commercial Code which have been called to its
					attention? If he says, yes, tell him that you put the court
					on notice that you will appeal that judicial determination,
					and that if you are damaged by his actions, you will sue him
					in Common Law action - under the jurisdiction of the U.C.C.&quot;
					<br><br>
				</blockquote>
				<h3 align="center">QUESTIONS AND REVIEW</h3>
				<p class="auto-style1">Note: These are some of the questions asked
				after the main lecture. Some are restatements of material presented
				earlier, but they contain very valuable information which is worth
				repeating. </p>
				<h2 align="center">COURTROOM TECHNIQUES </h2>
				<p class="auto-style1">Question: How did you &quot;box in&quot; the judge?
				</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">This is easy to do if you don&#39;t know too
				much. I didn&#39;t know too much, but I boxed them in. You must play
				a little ignorant. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">If you are arrested and you go to court,
				just remember that in a criminal action, you have to understand
				the law or it is a reversible error for the court to try you. If
				you don&#39;t understand the law, they can&#39;t try you. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">In any traffic court case or tax case you
				are called into court and the judge reads the law and then asks,</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&quot;Do you <u>understand</u> the charges?&quot;
				</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Defendant: <b>No</b>, (Your Honor,) <b>I
				do not!</b> </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Judge:</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Well, what&#39;s so difficult about that charge?
				Either you drove the wrong way on a one-way street or you didn&#39;t.
				You can only go one way on that street, and if you go the other
				way, it&#39;s a fifty dollar fine. What&#39;s so difficult about this that
				you don&#39;t understand?&quot;</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">D: Well, Your Honor, it&#39;s not the letter
				of the law, but rather the nature of the law that I don&#39;t understand.
				The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution gives me the right to request
				the court to explain the nature of any action against me, and upon
				my request, the court has the duty to answer. I have a question
				about the nature of this action. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">J: Well, what is that - what do you want
				to know? </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">Always! Ask them some easy questions first,
				as this establishes that they are answering. You ask: </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">D: Well, Your Honor, is this a Civil or Criminal
				Action?&quot; </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">J: It is criminal. (If it were a civil action
				there could be no fine, so it has to be criminal). </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">D: Thank you, Your Honor, for telling me
				that. Then the record will show that this action against ___(Straw
				Man Name)___ is a criminal action, is that right? </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">J: Yes. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">D: I would like to ask another question about
				this criminal action. There are two criminal jurisdictions mentioned
				in the Constitution; one is under the Common Law , and the other
				deals with International Maritime Contracts , under an Admiralty
				Jurisdiction . Equity is Civil, and you said this is a Criminal
				action, so it seems it would have to be under either the Common
				Law, or Maritime Law. But what puzzles me, Your Honor, is, there
				is no <i>Corpus Delicti</i> here that gives this court a jurisdiction
				over my person and property under the Common Law. Therefore, it
				doesn&#39;t appear to me that this court is moving under the Common
				Law. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">J: No, I can assure you this court is not
				moving under the Common Law. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">D: Well, thank you, your Honor, but now you
				make the charge against me even more difficult to understand, the
				only other criminal jurisdiction would apply only if there was an
				International Maritime Contract involved and I was a party to it,
				it had been Breached, and the court was operating in an Admiralty
				Jurisdiction. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">I don&#39;t believe I have ever been under any
				International Maritime Contract, so I would deny that one exists.
				I would have to demand that such a contract, if it does exist, be
				placed into evidence, so that I may contest it, but surely, this
				court is not operating under an Admiralty Jurisdiction. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">You just put words in the judge&#39;s mouth.
				</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">J: No, I can assure you, we&#39;re not operating
				under an Admiralty Jurisdiction. We&#39;re not out in the ocean somewhere
				- we&#39;re right here in the middle of the State of North Carolina,
				No, this is not an Admiralty Jurisdiction. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">D: Thank you, Your Honor, but now I am more
				puzzled than ever. If this/these charge/s is/are not under the Common
				Law, or under Admiralty - and those are the only criminal jurisdictions
				mentioned in the Constitution - what kind of jurisdiction could
				this court be operating under? </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">J: It&#39;s Statutory Jurisdiction. </p>
				<p class="auto-style1">D: Oh, thank you, Your Honor. I&#39;m glad you
				told me that. But I have never heard of that jurisdiction. So, if
				I have to defend under that, I would need to have the Rules of Criminal
				Procedure for Statutory Jurisdiction. Can you provide me with the
				location of a copy? </p>
