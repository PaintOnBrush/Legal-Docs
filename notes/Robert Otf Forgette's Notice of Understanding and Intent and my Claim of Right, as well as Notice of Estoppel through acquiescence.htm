Drive, Conroe, Texas 77301<br />Dear Named Party,<br />Notice to agent is notice to principal, notice to principal is notice to agent.  Affected parties wishing to dispute the claims made herein or make their own counterclaims must respond appropriately within TWENTY (20) days of service of notice of this action.<b><br /></b><b>I am serving herewith, My Notice of </b><b>Understanding and Intent and my Claim of Right, as well as Notice of Estoppel through acquiescence. You shall find the enclosed intact and complete.</b><br />I Robert-Michael: Of the Forgette Family, a flesh and blood living soul do
hereby make oath and state the following is my truth and my law.<br /><ul><li>Whereas : it is my understanding that America and all her people enjoy the
protection of common-law and it is my understanding that all living beings
(flesh and blood) are created equally under one creator and it is my
understanding that we are sharing this existence on Earth together under our
creator and it is my understanding that we have been given a conscience to
deliberate and make decisions for ourselves and it is my understanding that
equality before the law is paramount and mandatory and it is my understanding
that a statute is defined as a legislative rule of society which has been given
the force of law and it is my understanding that a society is defined as a
number of people joined by mutual consent to deliberate, determine and act for
a common goal and it is my understanding that the government of America is a
Representative Body and Representation can only come from consent and whereas I
am a peaceful and responsible human being and it is my understanding that peace
officers have a duty to distinguish between statute and law and whereas I have
the power to refuse intercourse or interaction with peace officers who have not
observed me breach the peace. Whereas, permanent estoppel by acquiescence
barring any peace officer or prosecutor from bringing charges against a
Freeman-of-the-Land under any act is created if this claim is not responded to
in the stated fashion and time.</li></ul><br />Page 2 of 3<br /><br /><ul><li>Therefore
be it now known to any and all concerned and effected parties, that I, Robert a
Freeman-on-the-Land do hereby state clearly and specifically and unequivocally
my intent to peacefully lawfully exist free of all statutory obligations
restrictions and maintain all rights at law and trade, exchange and barter.</li></ul><ul><li>Furthermore:
I claim the right not to apply for licenses, permits or to seek permission to
do any action, that are already lawful. </li></ul><ul><li>I
claim the right to exercise my “common law right to travel”, unhindered,
unencumbered, at my discretion in my private conveyance of the day, to with, my
private, unregistered, unlicensed mechanically propelled automobile.</li></ul><ul><li>I
claim the right to possess, cultivate or use medicinally any plant or other
medicine. Also to exercise omnipotent control over all of my own medical
affairs with or without a Doctor's oversight.</li></ul><ul><li>I
claim the right to possess unregistered firearms and ammunition and to use the
same for target practice at a range or for hunting for food and further swear
under oath never to open fire on another human being unless I am in fear of my
life and as a last resort to protect any other human life. I Also swear to come
to the aide of any peace officer should they request my assistance. That is my
personal oath.</li></ul><ul><li>Furthermore, I claim that the intentional blurring of the lines and the failure
to define between that which is legal, and that which is lawful in order to
extract capital from the masses by legislating freedom and then putting a price
tag on it is a crime on Man, and the failure to define between the Natural man
and the State created Fiction is nothing short of fraud, theft, breach of trust
and forced slavery, a heinous criminal activity of the most odious form.</li></ul><ul><li>I
claim that the courts in the United States of America are de-facto and are in
fact in the profitable business of conducting, witnessing and facilitating the
transactions of security interests and I furthermore claim that they require
the consent of both parties prior to providing any such services.</li></ul><ul><li>I
claim that anyone who interferes with my lawful activities after having been
served notice of this claim and who fails to properly dispute or make lawful
counterclaim is breaking the law, cannot claim good faith or colour of right
and that such transgressions will be dealt with in a properly convened court de
jure.</li></ul><ul><li>Furthermore,
I claim all transactions of security interests require the consent of both
parties and I do herby deny consent to any transaction of a security interest
issuing under any Act for as herein stated as a Freeman-on-the-Land I am not
subject to any Act.</li></ul><ul><li>Furthermore,
I claim my FEE SCHEDULE for any transgressions by peace officers, government
principals or agents or justice system participants is (1oz of gold ) ONE OUNCE
OF GOLD or portion thereof if being questioned, interrogated or in any way
detained, harassed, searched or otherwise regulated and (5oz of gold) FIVE
OUNCES OF GOLD or portion thereof if I am handcuffed, transported, incarcerated or subjected to any adjudication process
without my express,
written and Notarized consent.</li></ul><br />Page 3 of 3<br />

<ul><li>Furthermore,
I state that it is my duty to Claim such rights, to protect them and ensure
they exist for future generations.</li></ul><ul><li>Furthermore,
I claim that the law of agent and principal does apply and that service upon
one is equal to both.</li></ul><ul><li>Furthermore,
I claim the right to deal with any counterclaims or disputes publicly and in an
open forum using discussion and negotiation and to capture on video tape said
discussion and negotiation for whatever lawful purpose I see fit.</li></ul><ul><li>Responses
must be under Oath attestation, upon full commercial liability and penalty of
perjury and registered in the Notary Office herein provided no later than 20
days from the date of original service as attested to by way of certification
of service.</li></ul><ul><li>Failure
to register a dispute against the claims made herein will result in an
automatic default judgment and permanent and irrevocable estoppel by
acquiescence barring the bringing of charges under any statute or Act against
My Self, Robert-Michael: Of the Forgette Family.</li></ul>
