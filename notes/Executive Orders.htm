MORE TO COME SOON, THIS NOTE WILL EXPAND. This was just too important to allow it to disappear in the threads. A stroke of the pen does not equal the law of the land. Executive orders are applicable ONLY to the executive branch of the government. So Executive order 6102 was entirely unlawful, accept for the ignorant voluntary complian...ce of the people. I love that term ";voluntary compliance";. As if adding the word compliance after the word voluntary changes the definition of voluntary to mandatory. Voluntary compliance is simple, and the IRS loves to use this term to confuse people. If congress passes an act that is so blatently in violation of the Constitution that it could NEVER be law, it is wholly inapplicable as a matter of law. However, the signed consent of the individual in a civil adhesion contract can give the force of law to an unconstitutional act, and such consent then obligates that individual to that act. It does not however obligate ALL individuals to that act.
 
When FDR signed E.O. 6102 it was clearly not lawful, but the misguided patriotism of the people convinced them to comply with it anyway. This is WHY the people of this country CANNOT be the DEBTOR when speaking of the figure represented by the national debt clock. The people are the original creditor, the original source of investment the national debt figure is borrowed against. The Federal Government does not borrow money from the Federal Reserve Bank. The Federal Government borrows money from the people, because it is in bankruptcy receivership. America has been under martial law since 1933. This maritime admiralty law, is the regulation of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve Bank is overseeing the bankruptcy, and I might add, doing a PISS POOR job as they continue to debase their own financial instrument.
 
The American dollar, is 371 1/4 grains or 24.1 grams of pure .999 silver, or a comparable measure of gold. Paper has NEVER been money, not even gold certificates WERE money, they were but a representation of the money. Gold and silver ARE the money. As you can see the American dollar is doing quite well in the free market. Do you have American dollars, or do you trade in foreign debt instruments?
