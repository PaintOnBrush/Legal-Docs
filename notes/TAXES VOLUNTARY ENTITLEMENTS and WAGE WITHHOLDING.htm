A lie in application, not in form. Social security like the income tax itself is a voluntary entitlement program. In fact one is only obligated to the income tax by registration into the social security program. Registration is voluntary not mandatory. Americans are not obligated by law to posses and use social security numbers. If registration into social security were a mandatory obligation of law the number would just be assigned to you at birth, but that is not how it is done. YOU must APPLY for one, or your parents must apply for one on your behalf. And YOU are not obligated to that contract if your parents did apply for it for you.
 
42 U.S.C. 405 (c)(2)(b)(i) details the types of individuals that ARE required to be assigned a number. See the section I have the link below to prove this. Those types of individuals required to be assigned a number are
(I) to aliens at the time of their lawful admission to the
    United States either for permanent residence or under other
    authority of law permitting them to engage in employment in the
    United States and to other aliens at such time as their status is so
    changed as to make it lawful for them to engage in such employment;
(II) to any individual who is an applicant for or recipient of
    benefits under any program financed in whole or in part from Federal
    funds including any child on whose behalf such benefits are claimed
    by another person;
 
In law, the inclusion of one, provides the exclusion of the other. Because Americans who are not receiving benefits are not included, they are excluded by law. This is what is meant by ";law is written in black and white";. It is why cop cars are black and white. If you just read the black you get the wrong impression, you must also read what is hidden in the white. What is not stated is every bit as important as what is specifically stated. The income tax code, is merely the terms and conditions of the social security registration contract. One is only obliged to the income tax code by their own voluntary signed consent, into social security or other government entitlement programs/registrations. To give the magic to the word tax of calling this a tax is dangerous, although that is the general perception, hat is not exactly what it is. Even the IRS and president will tell you that the income tax is based upon voluntary compliance and self assessment. They just fail to tell you how it is you consent, and that it is not necessary for them to achieve your ";assent"; to achieve your ";consent";. As if the word compliance somehow changes the definition of the word voluntary.

Being that I have read the OBAMACARE bill aka HR 3590. I can tell you that the obamacare tax will be implemented in the same manner, because I have read the legislation. But OBAMACARE itself is ALSO 100% VOLUNTARY. the only reason there is all of this hype surrounding the few exemptions being issued, is not to exempt certain companies, no no no. It is SOLELY to create the perception of a mandate that does not exist in reality. Section 1555 of H.R. 3590 makes the entire program 100% voluntary. Again here is the actual section of the legislation that proves my point.
 
SEC. 1555. FREEDOM NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN FEDERAL
HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS.
No individual, company, business, nonprofit entity, or
health insurance issuer offering group or individual health
insurance coverage shall be required to participate in any
Federal health insurance program created under this Act
(or any amendments made by this Act), or in any Federal
health insurance program expanded by this Act (or any
such amendments), and there shall be no
penalty or fine imposed upon any such issuer for choosing
not to participate in such programs.
 
I encourage everyone to study and learn completely my FREE WEBSITE that I put together over 9 years ago regarding the income tax code. I openly state that I have not filed a tax return in over 10 years. I will never file a tax return again. I have no need to do so because 1 I have no socialist insecurity account number so I am not obligated to pay a tax, but I also do not allow withholding prom my earnings so there is nothing to be returned to me.
 
Because forms W-4 and 1040 both have OMB control # 1545-0074 on them, and this form was never approved for the collection of subtitle A income taxes even today shown by 26 CFR 602.101, it is an invalid bootleg request. These forms are in violation of 44 USC 3506(c)(1)(B)(iii) Also as neither of them inform the reader if the information being requested is mandatory or voluntary, so these forms are completely void and you may raise 5 CFR 1320.6(b) as your complete defense against any charges at any time for failure to comply with forms W-4 or 1040. In either case form W-4 is wholly voluntary. There is no obligation o flaw to allow withholding by your employer. This si an interest free loan to government on something that even if it applies to you, is not due until April 15th. Withholding cannot be mandatory because the payment is not even lawfully due yet. And it is not. 26 CFR 31.3402(p)-1 governs this W-4 agreement.

(II) the way such information is to be used;
(III) an estimate, to the extent practicable, of the burden of the collection;
(IV) whether responses to the collection of information are voluntary, required to obtain a benefit, or mandatory;
 
The language is entirely voluntary as well as the title of the section.
 
26 CFR 31.3402(p)-1 VOLUNTARY WITHHOLDING AGREEMENTS
(a) In general. An employee and his employer may enter into an agreement under section 3402(b) to provide for the withholding of income tax upon payments of amounts described in paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 31.3401(a)-3, made after December 31, 1970. An agreement may be entered into under this section only with respect to amounts, which are includible in the gross income of the employee under section 61, and must be applicable to all such amounts paid by the employer to the employee. The amount to be withheld pursuant to an agreement under section 3402(p) shall be determined under the rules contained in section 3402 and the regulations thereunder. See Sec. 31.3405(c)-1, Q&amp;A-3 concerning agreements to have more than 20-percent Federal income tax withheld from eligible rollover distributions within the meaning of section 402. (b) Form and duration of agreement. (1)(i) Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, an employee who desires to enter into an agreement under section 3402(p) shall furnish his employer with Form W-4 (withholding exemption certificate) executed in accordance with the provisions of section 3402(f) and the regulations thereunder. The furnishing of such Form W-4 shall constitute a request for withholding. (ii) In the case of an employee who desires to enter into an agreement under section 3402(p) with his employer, if the employee performs services (in addition to those to be the subject of the agreement) the remuneration for which is subject to mandatory income tax withholding by such employer, or if the employee wishes to specify that the agreement terminate on a specific date, the employee shall furnish the employer with a request for withholding which shall be signed by the employee, and shall contain-- (a) The name, address, and social security number of the employee making the request, (b) The name and address of the employer, (c) A statement that the employee desires withholding of Federal income tax, and applicable, of qualified State individual income tax (see paragraph (d)(3)(i) of Sec. 301.6361-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedures and Administration)), and (d) If the employee desires that the agreement terminate on a specific date, the date of termination of the agreement.
 
If accepted by the employer as provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, the request shall be attached to, and constitute part of, the employee's Form W-4. An employee who furnishes his employer a request for withholding under this subdivision shall also furnish such employer with Form W-4 if such employee does not already have a Form W-4 in effect with such employer. (iii) No request for withholding under section 3402(p) shall be effective as an agreement between an employer and an employee until the employer accepts the request by commencing to withhold from the amounts with respect to which the request was made.
 
26 CFR 31.3402(p)-1 (2)
(2)An agreement under section 3402(p) shall be effective for such period as the employer and employee mutually agree upon. However, either the employer or the employee may terminate the agreement prior to the end of such period by furnishing a signed written notice to the other. Unless the employer and employee agree to an earlier termination date, the notice shall be effective with respect to the first payment of an amount in respect of which the agreement is in effect which is made on or after the first ``status determination date'' (January 1, May 1, July 1, and October 1 of each year) that occurs at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is furnished. If the employee executes a new Form W-4, the request upon which an agreement under section 3402 (p) is based shall be attached to, and constitute a part of, such new Form W-4.
 
26 USC 3402(p)(3)(a)
(p) Voluntary withholding agreements (3) Authority for other voluntary withholding The Secretary is authorized by regulations to provide for withholding - (A) from remuneration for services performed by an employee for the employee's employer which (without regard to this paragraph) does not constitute wages, and (B) from any other type of payment with respect to which the Secretary finds that withholding would be appropriate under the provisions of this chapter, if the employer and employee, or the person making and the person receiving such other type of payment, agree to such withholding. Such agreement shall be in such form and manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe. For purposes of this chapter (and so much of subtitle F as relates to this chapter), remuneration or other payments with respect to which such agreement is made shall be treated as if they were wages paid by an employer to an employee to the extent that such remuneration is paid or other payments are made during the period for which the agreement is in effect.
