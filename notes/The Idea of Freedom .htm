An idea, which is the root of an ideal, can be both a friend and a  foe, as a friend, if pure in intention and righteous in cause, as well  as honorable at it's core, can be the most formidable of opponents to an  enemy. As an enemy, with no weapon to destroy and no body to burn, it  is understandably to be feared.
 
This is the FOUNDATIONAL CORE of SELF GOVERNANCE, the SUI JURIS  philosophy grounded in self evident truth, and the birthright that we  RULE OUR OWN MINDS, bodies, and administrate all of our own affairs. The  word GOVERNMENT  in itself derives from LATIN and literally translates  into (";GOVERN"; ) ";to rule";  (";MENTE";)";the mind";. Naturally a government  of the people by the people and for the people is a government of SELF  GOVERNANCE. Just as naturally as the LAWFUL claim and exercise of  freedom and activities which inherently cause no harm or violation of  rights to others, ARE themselves THE LAW, and the interference in this  freedom and infringement upon the free exercise of such activities ARE  CRIME, it is self evident that what most people have been lead to  believe about law is completely ASS BACKWARDS of what is true.
 
There IS without a doubt, an enemy, but it is NOT US that have to FIGHT.  There is without question, a clever, cunning, well camouflaged foe that  lurks, not in the shadows, but broad daylight, masquerading as a  friend, one that has sought to destroy this country's TRUE STRENGTH by  employing deceptions, illusions, the mixing of lies with truths, and the  creation of artificially manufactured incredulity around it's most  sensitive vulnerabilities.
 
The self evident truth is that England never stopped seeing America as  an enemy to be conquered, never stopped viewing it's people as  terrorists and traitors to the crown. THIS is why every aspect of  freedom is being morphed into the suspicion of terroristic plots. It is  why the exercise of freedom and assertion of DUTY to rights is like a  cross to a vampire to a judge and prosecutor attacking an American  without an element of harm to another.  
 
Since the inception of America England has been fighting an idea, an  idea so powerful, so pure in it's intention, so righteous in it's cause,  and so honorable at it's core, that only deception, illusions, and  ignorance can be used to battle it. The IDEA of self governance, of  INDIVIDUAL SOVEREIGNTY, and that we ALL inherently possess an individual  spark of divinity, an INDIVIDUAL connection to our creator, and that we  are all EQUALLY endowed by that creator with INDIVIDUAL rights, and  CHARGED THE DUTY OF THEIR LAWFUL DEFENSE, this is the idea that  literally scares the living hell out of the world's so called ";rulers";,  including the American government which has been infiltrated by the  crown of England at every level from the lowest secretary of the most  obscure assemblymen to the highest office of president.
 
Those who rule countries across the globe, have no more or less rights  than the poorest homeless people, who are left out in the cold starving  and freezing on the streets their forefathers conquered by their own  ignorance. EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, is literally a millionaire, and the  deception is designed to convince people to contract away their highest  birthrights, to act as slaves while falsely believing that they are  free, to suffer violations in the sickest form, and to believe that they  are a DEBTOR, when they are infact the ORIGINAL CREDITOR and HEIR to  this country.
 
The idea of self governance and individual sovereignty has been around  for many thousands of years, it is likely it existed in Sumerian culture  as well even though that first known civilization bowed to a king, it  is likely that this is where self governance originates. The divine  right of kings, a blood lineage right to rule traces back to Sumeria as  well, but those who have sought to rule over others have perverted this  divinely inspired IDEA. Those who seek to rule others would have the  masses believe that they have a divine right to rule over all others due  to their blood line, but the TRUE scope of the divine right of kings,  is the divine right of every single individual to rule themselves,  adhering to law simply by doing nothing to anyone else without their  consent, that they would not have done to them without their consent.
 
EVERYONE WHO BREATHES knows THE LAW. A child that can tell right from  wrong is more a master of THE LAW, than the slickest litigation  attorney. The SPIRIT of THE LAW is something that exists within each of  us BECAUSE we ALL have conscience to deliberate, and intelligence to  reason. Whether one calls it intuition, a sixth sense, vocal thought, or  otherwise, when we ask ourselves a question and weigh options to make a  decision, we ARE talking to a REAL albeit noncorporeal entity, that IS  US, our higher selves if you will.
 
This idea is why the alphabet agencies would have people believe groups  like mine are terrorists. And why they will expend great effort in the  form of man power and financial resources, to create an ambiance of  fear, intimidation, and hopelessness, to hold on to the grips of the  their illusory power over the LAW ABIDING. Make no mistake, NO ENTITY OF  STATE has OATH TO SPEAK (jurisdiction) over the LAW ABIDING. And this  alone is why they have expended such great resources to convince people  that they exist beneath, SUBJECT to the whims of the State.
 
This is why I accurately point out that the entity seeking to take your  freedom is inaccurately identified as the NEW world order. The fact is  that the entity seeking to rob the people of their freedom is actually  the OLD world order, that order of the world BEFORE heroes from England  pioneered individual sovereignty and self governance. It is nothing less  than the rule of pharaoh, which never truly died, just transformed.  After all those who believe they are free cannot see the bars of the  cell so they do not even know they are enslaved. This is what lead to  the great quote that none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who  falsely believe they are free.  
 
The good news is that they are failing. For all of their expense, for  all of their efforts, for all of their illusions and grand deceptions,  they have not been able to stomp this idea out of existence. Even  through the dark ages this idea survived on the winds breath and was  passed as legend and fable, to US, a people who ARE NOW FREE, but who  fear their freedom so cowardly that they would willingly remain enslaved  in exchange for an illusion of temporary security. Freedom, is an idea  yes, but it is ALSO an energy wave, and it truly does RING like a bell,  and ripples out from the center like a stone dropped on the surface of  glass calm body of water. It is an infectious wave that turns everyone  it touches into an additional source of energy to continue and spread  it's vibration. And once this ringing wave has begun it can never again  be silenced. This group, and it's members, ARE that beginning, the  tuning fork has been struck against the stone, and a force that now  stands to shatter diamonds and destroy illusions along with it is  beginning to spread like a wild fire, one that this bifurcated society's  ruling class will expend all effort in vain to silence. ME, I am just a  messenger, I do not seek to lead anyone, I just seek to teach people  that they have always had since their birth, the ability to lead and  rule themselves. The ability to be left alone by the State, BECAUSE they  are the law abiding, the lawful birthright heir of freedom, and that  they exist far outside the orbit of the reach of the State's ambition.  To ALL my members I say allow all of this to sink in deep. Decide for  yourselves who it is that is telling you the truth. The State, who  obviously wishes to rule over every aspect of your life, or ME, a simple  man who simply wants people to rule themselves.
 
This is probably one of my better inspirational posts. I suggest it be shared everywhere by anyone able to view it.
