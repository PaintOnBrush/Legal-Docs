I really hate facebook's inability to properly format copy and pastes. I have lost too many important posts by facebook crashing out on me. I now create every post I put up in notepad FIRST. Ok enough bitching. Below I have given a response that explains to a readers specific question why their efforts were unsuccessful in court. it explains the situation well. I am NOT going to go through that below however and line by line, reformat it. It shoudl be easy enough to follow. As promised this comment is intended to diagnose and explain exactly why the things you are doing are not working. For starters, if you are in court arguing that you dont have to follow certain rules, you have already lost. Everything they did was not convict you of anything, but sue you. It appears to me as the primary reason why you are not having success, is because you are not at all following the process I advance or the positions of the work my book and this group explain in great detail. Correct me if I am wrong, but I do not believe that you have my book, is that correct Chris? While I do love that my members in here are passionate and always willing to help, I can only ever stand behind the first hand information and documentation that I produce and the advice that I give, as well as the methods I suggest.         The second most obvious reasons why you are failing appear to me to be because, and this one is 2 pronged, 1 you are NOT using your own notices to offer discussion and conditional acceptance in an attempt to avoid conflict, if you walk into that court for that ticket having sent NO NOTICES, you are already in default and have already lost regardless of how well you argue or whether or not you did what you are accused of having done. it is ADMINISTRATIVE COURT. You are NOT there because of what you did to get the ticket. You are there because of what you did NOT DO after having received it. You MUST absolutely every single time you get a ticket make use of discussion, and that is how I got my own tickets dismissed. &#064;. the second prong of the 2 prong reason you are failing in court, is because in conjunction with your dishonor for having ignored the summons and not offered discussion, you are NOT making SPECIAL APPEARANCE. You OBVIOUSLY are only making GENERAL APPEARANCE and by automatic default in general appearance you are consenting to the court's jurisdiction. When you go to court regarding some violation ticket, regardless of the nature of the violation, after having answered the summons in writing, which should ALSO as a COURTESY but not a PREREQUISITE CONDITION, give the court notice of your intention to make special appeaance in this case to challenge jurisdiction. Doing THIS ALONE changes the entire nature of the very hearing you are being summoned to speak at. Instead of being an arraignment hearing where you are to enter a plea, notice of special appearance whether given in a notice answering the summons, or whether special appearance is simply announced after you state your name orally IN the court. In either case the function of special appearance is the same. The matter becomes abotu JURISDICTION ENTIRELY.SPECIAL APPEAANCE is the manner in which we show up to court regarding a hearing to contest the court's jurisdiction in the matter before that court. This is imperative and alone all by itself is usually the difference between victory and defeat. You see in order for a court to proceed in ANY matter before it, ONCE JURISDICTION IS CHALLENGED, the court ha an OBLIGATORY DUTY TO ESTABLISH UNEQUIVOCALLY presenting evidence to PROVE the existence of ALL 3 ELEMENTS of Jurisdiction, Standing, corpus Delict, and a VALID cause of action upon which this entity known as the state may act upon you. The fact here is that the court cannot merely ASSERT that it has jurisdiction, it must by preponderance of evidence, PROVE that jurisdiction exists. And it is not even the courts responsibility to prove that jurisdiciton exists, THAT is an obligation upon the prosecuting attorney, and because the standard of evidence here and burden of prof are identical there must be a prepnderance of evidence that EACH elemnent exists, actual evidence. In cases where there is jurisdiction this is simple to do, when there is not you will hear a lot of excuses. being that special appearance is the only method by which you can challenge the jurisdiction of the court without consenting to the jurisdiction of the court, when you do this and show up for your hearing, again once after honorably answering the summons in writing, interesting things happen that do not occur for the average litigant. Your answer to the summons SATISFIES the obligation of the summons to ANSWER, and your SPECIAL APPEARANCE satisfies the obligation fo the appearance to APPEAR. So by special appearance, bya ppearing solely to contest the court's jurisdiction, you have satisfied ALL requirements of the summons honorably WITHOUT having obligated yourself to ANYTHING the way you do by general appearance. Now when you show up to court under special appearance, and the court is unable to PROVE the existence of ALL 3 ELEMENTS which establish Jurisdiction, which ARE;1. Allegation under oath by a real party of interest declaring that you have caused ACTUAL damage or injury to person or property. 2. Allegation under oath by a real party of interest declaring that you have VIOLATED someone's individual rights.3. Redress ability of the court. You see the fact and self evident truth in ANY case before ANY court, is that the COURT only acquires jurisdiction by transference from a complaining party or real party of interest. The 3rd element of proving the existence of a court's jurisdiction, ONLY manifests by transference from a complaining party when UNDER OATH they allege 1 or BOTH of the first 2 elements. So under special appearance the moment you ask the court if there is EVIDENCE OF A COMPLAINING PARTY, and they fail to produce one, regardless of what excuse they give you simply conclude your special appearance and JUST WALK OUT.  You are FREE TO LEAVE the momen the court fails to prove jurisdiction. The polite way to do this is ";Your honor since the court has failed to produce a real party of interest I hereby conclude my special appearance and move to dismiss the charges for failure to prosecute."; This is what you are supposed to say by the time they are asking you to enter a plea. AFTER concluding your special appearance it is important that you understand you are not under arrest, and have NO obligation to remain, you are not surety and the court has no authority over you they failed to prove jurisdiction, which simply means oath to speak, so the court has no oath to speak OVER you period. The ONLY other manner in which a court acquires jurisdiction, as opposed to the first method with respect to crime, is BY CONSENT IN GENERAL APPEARANCE as well as when one claims in open court to UNDERSTAND the charges. Consent can be ASSUMED and PRESUMED when you do nothing by silent acquiescence when you for exampe IGNORE the summons and fail to answer it in writing. understand an ANSWER is uch different from a PLEA. That is the most damned interesting thing about consent, you do not have to do ANYTHING for someone to achieve CONSENT. And an officer and judge do not have to acieve ASSENT in order to achieve CONSENT. All you have to do to lose is silently acquiesce and fail to object.  Those who acquire my book, and who still have questions after it and the free audio who then pick up a block of my time, are infinitely better prepared for the entire experience. Those who however at LEAST have my book and apply the methods in it AS I TEACH THEM as opposed to manners in which they have heard others teach similar methods of similar applications which APPEAR and ONLY appear similar, WILL be competent to administrate their own affairs and to defend against these atrocities. Finally the last thing that indicates to me that you do not have my book and are not using the whole of the methods I teach, is that NO WHERE in my work do I advance or propose, that it will ALWAYS help people AVOID receiving violation citations. It very well can and certainluy often does to those who are applying it correctly, prevnt  The series of brief questions below and their respective answers will explain and detail exactly why you have failed in your endeavors. I highly suggest geting my book as asoon as possible, because in it you will find SUCCESSFUL fully detailed methods for everything to be achieved by you successfully.1. Did you send notice of conditional acceptance in response to your citation. ?2. Did you make SPECIAL APPEARANCE ?3. Did you claim in open court to UNDERSTAND the charges?4. Did you enter a PLEA prior to being INFORMED of the CAUSE AND NATURE of the CHARGES AND PROCEEDINGS against you?5. Did you sign the citation ";under protest and duress";
