I welcome this opportunity to engage in discussion to resolve this matter as it is always my intent to remain in honor and to avoid conflict.P2     No dog in my care has ever ";attacked, endangered, bitten, or inflicted severe injury on a human being on public or private property:or on any occasion severely injured or killed a domestic animal while off owners property; or been used primary or in part for the purpose of dog fighting or trained for dog fighting.";  Nor have I been notified by sworn statement from any person having first hand experience of any said behavior.  Nor have I ever been charged with any such behavior.P3     I do not understand your attempt, by coercion, to demand my participation in a hearing before the White County Board of Commissioners.  Having never agreed to knowingly contract with them I find that there is no standing nor jurisdiction in this matter.  I also have review their municipal/state code  O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20 “gives jurisdiction over violations of county resolutions and ordinances to the magistrate court of the county.”  I would not consent to relinquish my right to a trial by a jury of my peers had I actually been charged with any crime and presented with a real party of interest.  Please clarify under what authority you demand I appear before such a hearing. P4     I also ask you to clarify your reference to ";Animal Control Officer";.  Please make clear to me the type of Peace Officer an ";Animal Control Officers"; is.  I have request the badge number and date of oath and bond of those who have presented themselves to me both verbally and in written signature as an ";officer"; and having demanded from me my papers without charge of a crime.  When requested the officer attempted to intimidate me by laughing at me and avoiding my questions.  He refused to provided me with the information.  On these occasions I did cooperate with him under duress. I request from you the badge number, date of oath and bond of said employees.  If you can not provide thisinformation please explain to me the legal standing of said officer/employee. 18 U.S. Code § 912 - Officer or employee of the United StatesWhoever falsely assumes or pretends to be an officer or employee acting under the authority of the United States or any department, agency or officer thereof, and acts as such, or in such pretended character demands or obtains any money, paper, document, or thing of value, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.P6  As an agent for the property owner be notified that this property is posted with no trespassing signs.  This includes any and all government agents, except in the case of fire or medical emergency.  Those so trespassing are subject to civil and criminal penalties per USC title 18, section 241&amp; 242.  Violators will be treated as intruders.  A government official, agent, or any person (s) entering this property without the expressed consent of the owner and without proper warrant will be considered an intruder attempting to trespass, extort, injure, threaten, harass, intimidate, or otherwise jeopardize the life and property of the owner.  Any violation will be so charged to the fullest extent of the law.P7     Please clarify the authority that gives you the right to restrict my movement and behavior beyond the scope of actual law.   I am in fact a free woman born of the people of North America who has not been charged nor convicted of ANY crime. P8     I take great issue with your threats to remove from me person property and destroy it without due process and your presumption of guilt.  This is a clear violation of my rights as enumerated and protected by the Constitution of the United States of America. “It is a crime for one or more persons acting under color of law willfully to deprive or conspire to deprive another person of any right protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.” (18 U.S.C. §§ 241, 242) P9     In closing I say I have remain in honor at all times by answering all notices received by me from your office.  Please provide documentation of  notification, from your office to me, for any violations you allege remain unresolved.  I have attempted to resolve any and all false accusation against me by due process.  However, even after the assurance by Animal Control Officer Abernathy that I would be given the opportunity to face and cross examine my accuser in court when the court date arrive neither the alleged victim nor the officer appeared.  Therefore, I remain innocent having never been convicted of any wrong doing. I have discussed in detail my belief that you and your office are complicit in the harassment of myself by both your office and a neighbor but still you have persisted in the harassment.  Due to the inability to confront my accusers I am unable to determine if this is motivated by discrimination.  To date you and your representatives have lied, manipulated, intimidated, deceived, denied me due process, harassed and used threats and coercion against me but I have been and will remain in honor only living in peace.  I order you now to cease and desist all illegal and unlawful activity against me including but not limited to trespassing, harassment, threats and intimidation,<span class=""> complicity </span> or suffer the full weight of the law.  I demand the Sheriff, the White County Board of Commissioners, the County Manager, and the White Co Attorney to honor your oath and stop this abuse of power under color of law.Further affiant saith not.
