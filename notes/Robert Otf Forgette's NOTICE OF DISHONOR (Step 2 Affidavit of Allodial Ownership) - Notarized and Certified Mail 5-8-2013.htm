Please be advised you are at this moment on notice regarding the proper status of ownership, with respect to my private property referenced in that notice. Please make note that all peaceful and lawful remedy which exists at law will be employed to lawfully defend these rights that I have lawfully claimed UNDER OATH. Your office’s refusal to record that notice will have no lawful force, as a MAXIM of law, anything which ought be done, MUST be seen as having been done, so whether or not you actually record the document is of no concern to me.  From a legal perspective it WILL be seen as having been recorded.<br />Please note that your office’s refusal to record the affidavit which has been delivered and sworn under OATH, is being interpreted as intent to deliberately and knowingly, willfully deprive me of fundamental rights under color of law, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 242. Also note the conversation you obviously had with the county attorney with respect to this affidavit, which you base your LAWLESS determination upon, is evidence of CONSPIRACY AGAINST RIGHTS in violation of 18 U.S.C.241. These are felony charges carrying over 10 years in sentencing that I WILL be filing if this blatant and obviously intentional violation of my fundamental rights continues. You were sent a SWORN affidavit declaring a fundamental right, which YOU do not have the authority to deprive me of.<br />My sending you this affidavit is also the exercise of a lawful and fundamental right. I made no REQUEST for your office to consider and you were put ON NOTICE as to the rights declared. THIS notice here, is to advise you that you have in fact dishonored a BILL OF EXCHANGE, a negotiable instrument, sworn true under penalty of perjury. In addition to advising you of your DEFAULT with respect to the affidavit, THIS notice gives you another 15 days to PROPERLY answer and dispute anything which you do not agree with. This notice also intends to offer discussion as the first affidavit did, in order to avoid potential and foreseeable conflict. I do not understand exactly what it is your office is attempting to communicate in response to me, because your response was invalid and non responsive. So let us be mature adults and speak plainly as I am and let us speak truthfully under oath. And just so it is clear, these notices are a courtesy, not a prerequisite to the exercise of the rights I am noticing you, which I intend to exercise.<br />Just so that there is NO confusion here on out, this notice is intended to offer discussion to avoid the potential conflict I can foresee arising. I honestly do not see the basis for what your office appears to be attempting to assert with respect to the lawful status of ownership I am asserting, with respect to this property. Please answer the questions below so that I can learn exactly what it is the disagreement is here.<br />1. Does your office believe that the affidavit I sent was NOT true? <b>(no)</b><br />2. Is your office claiming that the fundamental right of Allodial Ownership of property no longer exists? <b>(no)</b><b> </b>3. Are you aware that it is a very serious felony to collude with another individual and to discuss committing a crime, even if YOU are unaware that the activity you are discussing is unlawful? <b>(yes)</b><b> </b>4. Is it the intention of Montgomery County Records, County Clerk: Mark Turnbull to deprive me of my fundamental right to Allodial Ownership of property? <b>(no)</b><b> </b>5. Please specify EXACTLY which crime I was convicted of, on what date and which court of competent jurisdiction, removed this right from my possession AFTER having convicted me of said crime by a jury of my peers. <b>(No Conviction exists, no rights were removed.)</b><b> </b>6. In the event that there is no evidence a jury has lawfully removed this right from me, is it the intention of Montgomery County Records, County Clerk: Mark Turnbull to further violate another of my fundamental rights and that being to due process of law? <b>(No)</b><b> </b>The incorrect and grossly negligent advice given to you by the county attorney in this matter will NOT spare YOU from personal liability in this matter. As county recorder you have a DUTY to perform and due diligence to KNOW what your duty is, means that blind ignorance and gross negligence of your own, will not spare you from the reach of any action I must take to lawfully and peacefully defend the right I have asserted, which I am exercising. I will make use of ALL remedy available AT LAW to peacefully and lawfully defend the rights I am claiming,of which YOU are violating.<br />This notice as well as the last one, is being sent in good faith without any intention of causing undue harassment. <b>With respect to THIS notice of dishonor, I swear, attest and </b><b>certify that every statement made herein is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.</b><br />I hereby offer in COMMON LAW, via these NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS, in an attempt to avoid potential foreseeable conflict, DISCUSSION, the highest remedy available at law. By accepting this notice and the prior affidavit and registering a VALID response we can avoid conflict all together in this matter. Should you fail to answer this notice, the default answers provided will be given FOR YOU and will constitute a SHARED UNDERSTANDING by way of ACQUIESCENCE and DEFAULT.<br /><br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Autograph:  ______________________________  Date: ____ - ____ - ________                 Robert-Michael: Of the Forgette Family<br /><br /><br />Notary:<br />______________________________________________________
