I am posting this NOT to insult, belittle, or attack any member, and removing the identity for privacy so only the individual member this involves knows who exactly I am speaking of, out of respect. This is being posted as a PRIME and PERFECT example of EXACTLY what NOT to do, and WHY it is absolutely so damned imperative that people who ask for my advice, follow it to the letter, as opposed to doing the instinctive programmed thing in response and doing the exact opposite of what I say. 
 
Just today, not even a WEEK after I aired this latest show about CPS, I get an email from someone I have been assisting with their CPS investigation. I explained exactly what to do and why, and how doing exactly what I did with MY OWN CPS investigations, the member could have secured the same results I did which is 2 unfounded determinations and a complete seal of ALL records pertaining to that investigation. Instead of doing as instructed, and demanding warrants, refusing to comply or cooperate in any way with the investigation, and launch a counter offensive against that agency for their repetitive and maliciously aggressive unwarranted investigation techniques. By this point in time of instruction the child was in the member's custody still, and CPS had on numerous occasion harassed the member without a single iota of evidence of abuse or neglect what so ever. AFTER being advised that 70% of ALL CPS investigations result from a malicious report intended SOLELY to cause harassment, and only 30% of reports contain genuine abuse or neglect, that these agents had a duty to exercise investigative discretion, and be able to tell the difference just from the complaint in most cases. This member did the exact opposite of what they were instructed to do, cooperated out of fear with the investigation, did NOT demand warrants or evidence or to confront their accuser, and at this very moment their child has been taken away from them with respect to an unquestionably UNFOUNDED complaint. There is gross negligence here, fraud, dereliction of duty, violation of oath of office, conspiracy against rights, deprivation and intimidation in the free exercise and enjoyment of rights under color of law, obstruction of justice, malfeasance, and misfeasance as well, on the part of CPS and NOT the member. The member's child has been removed from the home, the parent presumed guilty until proven innocent, and of what is unknown, I have not yet heard back on details about their grounds for removal, but it is undoubtedly some statutory nonsense which is not a crime and does not constitute genuine abuse or neglect. There is without a doubt no crime here, and no authority for CPS to do ANYTHING. ONLY a JURY can remove someone's life, freedom, rights, or property, and ONLY upon conviction of a CRIME, NOT a statutory infraction. Agents of CPS simply could never have the authority these agents are exercising unlawfully.
 
 
 
Having been on the other end of this, having been forced to call CPS on a parent that lives on my street, for allowing their two year old to go into the middle of the street and play and walk away from the child leaving him in the middle of the street because he wouldn't cooperate, and for 5 minutes I did sit back and just observe this 2 year old child playing in the middle of the street before I piped up and ordered the parent to retrieve their child from the dangerous road, I know what it means to report to CPS and the reverence that duty should demand. I called CPS and provided pictures of a parent more than a football field away from their 2 year old child in the middle of the street yelling at them. I provided evidence and I was willing to testify under oath it was not an anonymous complaint. THIS is the standard which CPS requires to obtain a warrant for their investigation. It is with THIS level of credibility to a complaint that an agency like this is furnished VALID CAUSE.
 
 
 
The foregoing was to give some background, here is the message I got and my response to it. I HAVE LINKED THE RADIO SHOW FROM 02-09-2013 in this because this SO compliments the show it is not even funny. I explain on the show that people who cooperate are more likely to have their kids taken away. HERES THE DAMNED PROOF!!

Has my brother in law ********************** told you that the state kidnapped our daughter and we are fighting to get her back. They screwed up from the beginning and now they continue to make up things.I am devastated our child is our world and I am having a really difficult time .Our lawyers wont let me go to the media or anything.The Judge ordered a homestudy on my mom (grandmother) and the Judge told our attorneys that she wants to work with the parents.But the case mg is prob going to give it a negative because thats what they do and then we have to wait and go in front of the Judge.It should be positive so hopefully that will be a ray of light.Sean sent me your link to your radio show that he listened to the other night but I am too upset to listen to it.I am sick of all the worst case scenarios WE need things to move faster and get our child home. I have always been a fighter to get things done and in control and now I have no control.Any advise?xo

I actually do have some advice to give. At this point your fastest remedy will be the attached. You want to file this petition right in supreme court, there is a branch division of the supreme court in EVERY county. I have attached a writ of habeus corpus, which is very broad in scope but only used today in a limited fashion when people are actually in state custody. But your child IS in State custody, and there is likely ZERO evidence of abuse or neglect. This petition is this kind they wake judges up to hear. It is a special and extraordinary writ, and because of mass ignorance you are going to have to be able to verbally articulate the argument included in the writ, of equal rights and protections. They will attempt to dissuade you from using this writ like this but do not allow it.
 
 
 
I really hate to say this but they would have likely closed the investigation already if you would have taken my advice in the beginning. Instead you tried to do everything you could to bend over backwards to prove yourself innocent, and instead of that working, they used your compliance with their fishing expedition to acquire things they could use against you, where if you had refused to open your doors to begin with your child would still be with you. I am not trying to fault or insult you, I just want you to see that the fear they instinctively inspire in people that fosters this compliance and cooperation, is designed lull you into a false sense of security that compliance will speed up the closing of the investigation, when in reality it gives them exactly what they need to make your life hell.
 
 
 
Your fear was that if you exercised lawful rights and stood your ground refusing to comply with their investigation that they would use your simple exercise of lawful rights as an excuse to take your child, but they cannot infer guilt nor even use your refusal to cooperate as evidence against you to get a warrant. Had you aggressively defended your rights and demanded warrants they would never have been able to take your child at all.
 
 
 
Please explain to be as best as you can, what their rounds for removing your child is. I am doing the best I can but I am going on this blind because I do not know what their actual cause for removal is. From this point on you are going to have to try your best to pack all of that emotion and channel it into usable energy to drive you. Your efforts to comply are what lead to them finding an excuse to remove your child, so from here on out you are going to have to aggressively assert, claim, exercise, and defend your rights without backing down to fear. You have nothing left to lose at this point. I tried to help you prevent this from happening and had you listened to what I said you would have been successful and not in a position trying to get your child back, your child would never have been taken. Regardless of how upset you are, I have put the information you need at your finger tips and explained everything so that anyone can understand it. There is no longer any excuse for weakness, nor even fear, your greatest fear has become a reality because you did not aggressively defend your rights and willingly opened your doors to an investigation after being told what would happen if you did. I can only open the do for you though, YOU have to choose to walk through it.
 
 
I have not heard anything from ************************ about this at all. I will continue to be here to help all I can but you MUST be willing to help yourself and review the material. I cannot help anyone who is not willing to help themselves. I myself faced down and defeated 2 investigations by CPS which were unfounded, in the last 6 months. I aggressively defended my rights and demanded warrants, which they could not get, so they could get no evidence to substantiate ANY charge. The only difference between you and I is that you cooperated and I did not.*************Message from relative************************
Hi,  Rob, this is ************.  I am the brother in law of *************  whose adopted child has been kidnapped by CPS.  I have fed her all the  information from you, in fact, I sent her to you for advice.  She was  too afraid to file a habeus corpus, and her attorney said she couldn't  because it wasn't a criminal case.  What a crock of shit!!!   She is  afraid to do anything.  The reason I am writing you is they want the  child advocate to come to my house now to talk to my wife, her sister,  to find out more background info on the family.  I have said no person  related to CPS in any way is allowed on my property, I shoot first, ask  questions later, I have a blonde 7 year old daughter, and I am a long  haired musician, I don't need any trouble.  What do you think?  Should I  let my wife invite this lady in?  Thanks for your time, you are a  wonderful person for helping people in need.
 
***********MY RESPONSE*************8********
If  she is to speak to her have her do it outside not inside the home. KNOW  you are not obligated to answer any questions you dont want to answer,  and dont be afraid to let them know you know your rights and are in  control.
I am very well aware of this situation, I have been  trying to help your sister in law from the beginning even before they  actually took the child, having put down personally 2 CPS investigations  successfully using my own methods I assured her if she did what I said  she would be successful. But she did not. She succumbed to fear. She  absolutely can use a writ of habeus corpus and can absolutely take it  right to supreme court. because this matter involves fundamental rights,  there is no need to waste time in the lower courts you can go right to  the top the supreme court, with any matter that involves a fundamental  right, and there is no more fundamental of a right than that of custody  of your children. The writ of habeus corpus can be used in ANY SITUATION  where one is UNDER ANY COLOR OR PRETENSE restrained in their freedom.  ESPECIALLY when due process of law has been so egregiously violated.
I  cannot do anything to help her if she is not willing to help herself.  And listening to an attorney is not going to do anything but scare and  confuse her more because attorneys will lie.*******************************************************************I seriously wish this family the best of luck, they are going to need a great deal of luck if they think the system is just going to GIVE back the child without a fight. It has seized its property from them. People have to understand that eh spirit of justice requires more than summary arbitrary removal of rights freedom or property, that DUE PROCESS is not just necessary, it is integral to the fabric of freedom, and it is REQUIRED, not OPTIONAL.
