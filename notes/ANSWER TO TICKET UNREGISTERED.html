ANSWER TO 2A22087CSP

Dear BTVB,
The main purpose for this notice is due to the fact that the notice I have on citation #
2A22087CSP, says I must answer this ticket within 15 days or I risk both summary judgment and
suspension of my license. I hereby give you the same courtesy, you must respond within 15 days
of you will forever create permanent estoppel by acquiescence to all points not refuted forever
barring this matter from being raised again.
I am attempting to fulfill the requirements of your notice in honor, however it states I am
able to answer online at <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nysdmv.com%2Feplead.htm&amp;h=BAQFHZ1sW&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, "http:\/\/www.nysdmv.com\/eplead.htm");" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, "http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.nysdmv.com\u00252Feplead.htm&amp;h=BAQFHZ1sW&amp;s=1");">www.nysdmv.com/eplead.htm</a>, but 1. That website has moved which I
have found the new location, of my own due diligence, and 2. the ticket referenced has not yet
been uploaded to be answered, and the site states it could take as long as 180 days for it to be so
uploaded for answering and pleadings. This creates a problem as my license could be suspended
and default judgment entered against me after just 15 days, long before it is even possible to so
answer, as such you are receiving my answer via this notice instead. Also the notice states i can
answer by mail by following the instructions on the reverse side of the notice, but there are no
instructions on the reverse side of the notice. As I did with searching for the new EPLEAD
website, I again have exercised due diligence in locating the proper mailing address to answer the
tickets. I have requested email notification of when the ticket is uploaded and have confirmation #
20120211-07746732 of that fact from the DMV website. I will answer this online as well if and
when possible.
I believe at this time it is premature to enter a plead. I am not an attorney, and I do wish to
make certain that I receive full compliance with my right to due process of law, as such I am
hereby offering discussion in honor to avoid this conflict if at all possible. Discussion and
discovery are very important elements of due process of law that allow avoidance of conflict.
Should I need to appear for a hearing or trial, I will do so sui juris, of my own right, competent to
administrate all of my own affairs without need of representation, nor declaration of such a
represented status. I am competent to speak for myself and have conscience to deliberate and
decide upon information. The reason I am at this time unable to enter any plead is for lack of
discussion and discovery which would allow me to be informed as to all elements of the cause and
nature of the charges and proceedings so against me. As such I do not understand nor do I
consent to stand under the cause and nature of the charges and proceedings against me with
respect to this citation.
Discussion is important, because I wish to save the State valuable resources of time and
money of going to trial on issues that are non issues. with respect to citation 2A22087CSP for
example, I am in possession of a DMV restoration notice regarding DMV order # C1112220000.
I did make the officers aware of the existence of this notice at the time of the stop which should
have prevented the issuance of this citation to begin with. This notice references REG SUSP
ORDER C111211 and is a restoration notice, meaning the suspension of the registration and
suspension of my wife's driver's license has been rescinded. Reason is, 'ACCEPTABLE PROOF
RECEIVED". This is why discussion is so important, we can now avoid this matter all together as
it is not true that I was traveling in an unregistered motor vehicle as charged. The effective date of
this notice is 01-04-2012, so the officers should have had record of this although my wife forgot
to leave the notice in her truck which I was using lawfully. The notice states to carry it for one
month, which expired 02-04-2012, and the date of the citation is 02-10-2012, so I am not even at
fault for not having the notice of restoration in the car. I expect the facts herein discussed to cause
the withdrawal of this charge related to citation 2A22087CSP as to not waste the time of either
the officers, or the courts.
I hereby declare attest and swear that all information in this document is true and correct to the
best of my knowledge and that I have personal knowledge of the facts contained herein and do
accept personal responsibility for all statements made and facts presented.
Most Sincerely,
Robert D. Johnson
