RE: CONTRACT #1207642
 
PETITION TO NOTIFY A REDRESS OF
 WRONGFUL
 
2nd Notice NOTICE OF DISHONOR, NOTICE OF
DISCHARGE, NOTICE OF IMPENDING DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 
NOTICE ALSO THAT I HAVE ANSWERED / APPEARED FOR THIS REFERENCED NOTICE, SO YOU MAY NOT SUSPEND ANY LICENSE THAT MAY EXIST, AND THAT THE ONLY THING THAT
COULD POTENTIALLY BE SUSPENDED IS THE COMMERCIAL PERMIT, NOT MY PRIVATE RIGHT TO TRAVEL
 
Dear Burton Court,
 
This notice is to answer your notice of ordinance Ticket #1207642, notice date 01/07/2013; notice DUE date 01/27/2013. I have already acknowledge receipt of your notice by certified letter # 70113500000078039576 received in your agency by Cassandra Weststrock, on 1/10/2013. This notice is to notify you of your error by dishonoring my notice by ignoring it.  As the notice 1207642, issued by one of your agents #18028, told me to do, ";I [could] enter my appearance by mail…";, since I did appear by mail you are in error. During my first 'special appearance,"; by mail I discharged that notice by seeking clarification before I would enter a plea of ANY kind. I do not understand the cause and nature of the charges and proceedings that appear to be against me. In my notice to discuss the contract your agent / officer handed me, I clearly stated the needs I had before I could agree to any contract.  If you do not acknowledge that notice I will FIRE YOU ON THE SPOT!! The alleged amount owed, I believe IS $60; I am not sure because the amount is not disclosed in the contract that I received on 01/07/2013.  Also, there appears to be no signature by the agent /officer signing where it says ";I served a copy of the civil infraction complaint upon the defendant (owner/occupant) by posting if applicable. I am not a lawyer and he never clearly stated any such thing to me. Since this was not communicated to me or not verified by his signature (printed) entered into this contract, I will need verification of what that means and if the officer's neglect of his signature can even validate this contract? I believe you should save the taxpayers money and dismiss this case now. There appears to be some miscommunication in this matter, as I certainly do not recall having been found guilty of this alleged crime.
 
Here is a link on contracts of any kind and what constitutes as a lawful contract just in case you need to get refreshed. I feel this is done in kindness and in due diligence since I sense a lack of knowledge, on your part, of this subject:

The primary focus of concern in this matter regarding your notice is the very first thing it claims I have failed to comply with. “1. Respond to citation ticket 1207642 listed here in, or 2. Face a notice of impending default judgment”. This error is acknowledged on your part and excused, the fact is that you DID receive a “response” to the seatbelt ticket. This response was received by you verified by certified mail U.S.P.S. tracking ID# 70113500000078039576. Acceptance is verified delivered as January 10, 2013. The response notice was entitled NOTICE OF CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE / NOTICE OF DISCHARGE BY WAY OF SEEKING CLARIFICATION / NOTICE OF FEE SCHEDULE / NOTICE OF PERMANENT ESTOPPEL BY ACQUIESCENCE
 
[ Also included now is a NOTICE OF ADDENDUM 
to the: 
 
NOTICE OF CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE / NOTICE OF DISCHARGE BY WAY OF SEEKING CLARIFICATION / NOTICE OF FEE SCHEDULE / NOTICE OF PERMANENT ESTOPPEL BY ACQUIESCENCE
 
ADDENDUM NOTICE: 
 
NOTICE TO APPEAR / NOTICE OF ABATEMENT and will include a without prejudice copy of the only evidence i have on this matter which is the copy of contract 1207642 officer 18028 of your department handed me on 01/07/2013. ] End of ADDENDUM
 
During my appearance (response) I do not dispute the charges, but I also do not accept or consent to stand under them. I did not waive any of my rights to a hearing nor enter a response of guilt nor not guilty. My response acts in honor, and offers conditional acceptance, but more so it offers discussion to avoid conflict. I asked for only a few items to help me in this investigation in my appearance / response, 1. a signed original bill, 2. a copy of the lawful 2 party contract that makes me liable to pay it, and 3. The position of where the agent was at, then I would agree to pay any debt which I am lawfully contractually obligated to pay. I also asked for a special inquiry into why two (2) Flint officers shined a light onto me.
 
It is important that your department understands that THIS notice IS a 'special response' (APPEARANCE) to YOUR notice, and that the notice I sent which was delivered to you on January 10, 2013, IS a response to the seatbelt ticket. As I understand it this means there is contention of your notice that I have failed to respond to a seatbelt ticket 1207642. If you dispute this you must answer this notice in writing. My response to the ticket 1207642 delivered on January 07, 2013 is ALSO imposed against the City of Burton; notice of impending default judgment. Because I have responded honorably to your seatbelt ticket, and we are equal, I can impose any requirement upon YOU that you can impose upon ME. As it stands the City of Burton has still not responded to that notice, so this notice I just received from you is not valid because you are currently in default and dishonor for non acceptance of my notice in response, and / or for unlawfully entering a plea of any kind, on my behalf, that I did not consent to. I do not know if perhaps your department is unaware of exactly how to make use of the very common law, administrative process, of discussion that you demand as a standard, by requiring a response in the first place. But the fact of the matter is that a response WAS given in writing. I have already appeared before a “hearing officer” whom I might add is not in a position to determine guilt. Just so there is no confusion, my attempts to offer discussion in THIS notice first receive by your department on January 10 2013, to avoid conflict, are necessary in order for me to be duly informed of the cause and nature of the charges and proceedings against me. At this hearing I was not permitted to confront witnesses, nor was there any opportunity for discussion and discovery in spite of the fact that this has been requested in writing long before the date of this hearing. ALSO at this hearing I motioned to dismiss, but the hearing officer cut me off and did not allow me to explain. The cause of my motion to dismiss was due to the fact that I responded to the ticket, imposed an obligation to answer just like you did, and I was ignored, so just as the City of Burton could have secured a default judgment had I failed to answer the seatbelt ticket notice, I qualify to have default judgment in MY favor granted, and the charges dismissed.  However, the hearing officer REFUSED TO HEAR THE MOTION, in violation of due process of law and in complete dereliction of his/her duty and gross negligence, stated that he/she was “sustaining the ticket”.
 
Due process of law has been violated here. I advised the hearing officer in my notice that I would be exercising my right to a jury trial in this matter, and the hearing officer violated that right, by stating I did not have a right to a jury trial. The fact is that I DO have a right to have a jury decide this case. The amount in question exceeds 20.00, and the right of a jury trial is not to be infringed, as protected by the 7th amendment to the Constitution for these united States.
 
Every action from the initial transaction with your agent, to the threat of increasing the amount of the allegedly due, equates to intimidation in the free exercise and enjoyment of my rights. This is very simple, I have a right to receive a bill and a copy of a contract for ANY alleged debt. There was never a bill DULY presented, and you were noticed of this in my appearance / response, received by your department, on January 10, 2013, as non presentment was one of the highlighted notices at the very top of the notice. It also appears as if there is a conspiracy to deprive me of my rights under color of law. The City of Burton by increasing the penalty amount of a fine, simply because I have chosen to fulfill my duty to claim and exercise the right to defend myself and property, has Claimed an imposed fee for the exercise of a right, and used this imposition of a fee to intimidate me from exercising my right to a trial by jury. These are crimes specifically prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 241/242. In addition the hearing officer was grossly negligent for sustaining a ticket that was responded to and the City of Burton was in default with respect to, having failed to answer the answer which sought clarification. I hope that you notice this notice, because the fact is the city of Burton is in default on this matter and the charges should be dismissed immediately according to all that is law and justice.
 
This notice I am responding to now also states that I have been set up a court date 'as if' I plead not guilty. I want to make it crystal clear that I have not plead 'not guilty', nor have I plead 'guilty.' It is too early in the proceedings to do this. It is important to note that I did not ask for an attorney and have not entered a plea of guilty or not guilty in arraignment.  I have not agreed and have NO interest in having non-government cases tried in private, for-profit, commercial courts, where the common law is absent, and unalienable rights are waived. The problem with this is that a hearing officer is not a judge, does not allow the confrontation of witnesses, and is conducting a hearing not a trial so NO ONE can be found GUILTY of ANYTHING by a hearing officer. This is a further violation of due process of law, attempting to merge a hearing which is intended to inform the individual of the nature and cause of the charges and proceedings, WITH a trial. 
ONLY a JURY or a JUDGE can hand down a lawful finding of guilt. Further more as mentioned in the first notice I sent in response to the ticket, I do not understand the cause and nature of the charges proceedings or your communications and notices to me at all. I am not incompetent. I am saying that I do not consent to stand under the cause and nature of the charges and proceedings against me, and that this is because there has been no
discussion or discovery in this matter which could clarify. From the information I have received so far I see nothing that indicates that there is a real party of interest or a complaining party alleging under oath damage or injury to person or property, nor violation of a lawful right. As such it appears transparent that this is not a criminal matter, because there is no valid cause of action, no corpus delicti, no actual or justiciable controversy, and there is no evidence of standing, there is no evidence of jurisdiction either. No court has as of this time, acquired “oath to speak” by the transferrence of oath from a complaining party regarding this. As this is indisputably true the only possible alternative is that you are claiming that I owe someone some debt. It is not clear whom I owe, nor do I have record of this debt. AGAIN I request a signed original bill, and a copy of the lawful 2 party contract which you base these charges upon. The statutory charges that seem to be alleged in this matter are but an infraction, a violation of the terms and condition of a contract, but as far as I am aware I am not in contract, nor bound to those rules.
 
Also Notice of my FEE SCHEDULE as mentioned in the first disregarded notice I sent to appear was my charge for document write up of these notices is ONE (1) hour for any transgression by peace officers, government principals or agents or justice system participants is ONE OUNCE OF GOLD (1oz of gold) per hour, or portion thereof, for being questioned, interrogated or in any way detained, harassed, searched or otherwise regulated and (5oz of gold) FIVE OUNCES OF GOLD or portion thereof, per hour, or $5,000 if gold value falls below $1,000, if I, (or any property I own) am handcuffed, transported, incarcerated or subjected to any adjudication process without my express written and Notarized consent. 
 
Furthermore since this agency did not dismiss this unlawful contract and detained my time by having me again writing up a dishonor notice, etc. to your agency, for your error.  I initiate my fee schedule against  XXX            for ignoring my special appearance by mail. Attached is the bill for this charge: the amount of gold at the time of this action was $1,662.00 for write up of paper fee.
 
Finally, in closing, the alleged accusation is “traveling without a seatbelt”.  I wear my seatbelt always regardless of the statute, however, I find it very extreme to use emergency lights for non emergency reasons. This statute is completely unjust for The People who have an unalienable right to travel un-infringed.  I am going to say straight up that this past summer this state removed the statute for men and women to ride their motorcycles without helmets.  This clearly was for the purpose for Bike Week to drive through Michigan because they threatened to not travel through this state.  I am not chattel and I am not going to watch as some get special treatment (and putting their lives in way more danger than not wearing a seatbelt) just for the profit of the state while they suck  money from the residence of this territory, I feel it is egregious for this city or state to display their greed and corruption so blatantly.  
 
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE CAUSE AND NATURE OF THE CHARGES AND OR PROCEEDINGS TO FOLLOW AGAINST ME IN THIS MATTER.
 
I, hereby, declare, attest, and swear that all information in this document is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and that I have personal knowledge of the facts contained heron and do accept personal responsibility for all statements made and facts presented.
 
Most Sincerely,
