Another year passes, and again we come to the annual date where this country celebrates the mark of it's official independence from England, and one more time I am forced to point out to people that today's date has NOTHING to do with our ACTUAL independence from England. This may or may not be the date when the Declaration of Independence was unanimously agreed upon, but that has nothing to do with OFFICLALLY marking our independence. NOTHING throughout history has EVER been based upon a date of unanimous agreement, NO OTHER act or law has ever been retroactive to the date it was agreed upon being enacted, and so the Declaration of Independence, having NOT been officially signed into law until AUGUST 2nd, even STILL has NOTHING to do with our OFFICIAL independence. If we want to be OFFICIAL and TECHNICAL, the official independence of this country is September 3, 1783 which is the date the Treaty of Paris was signed which ENDED the revolutionary war. A declaration is an excellent method of exercising power, the first true exercise of official American power DID come in the form of a declaration, the most important historical monument to freedom ever, the Declaration of Independence, but this did not actually CREATE that independence. Just because something is declared does not mean it is recognized. So to recap, July 4th was NOT the date this country was born. Nor was it the date independence was declared officially, that would be August 2nd 1776. And even still that act did not officially divorce us from England. That occurred September 3rd, 1783. So, WHY IS IT JULY 4th WAS CHOSEN?***********************************************************************************************The answer to this question is as intriguing as the rest of the facts around this I have already laid out. As everyone is aware the secret societies running this planet controlling governments all across the world, observe occult (hidden) references with respect to time. The date of July 4th is an astro-theological symbolic representation of the separation between England and America, between THE CROWN, and ORIGINAL 13 COLONIES. July 4th is a date which happens to mark also, a phenomenon known as APHELION, the reverse of perihelion. Aphelion is a scientific reference to the point of greatest separation between the Earth, and the sun during it's elliptical annual orbit cycle. On July 4th each year, the Earth and the sun, are farther apart than at any other time. THIS astronomical representation of the separation between the Earth and Sun is why July 4th was chosen for the date of our official independence. It has NOTHING at ALL to do with the date some men in wigs decided upon the Declaration of Independence. If it did have ANY thing to do with that at all, August 2nd would have been the date, and if it had ANY thing at all to do with the actual independence, it would have been September 3rd 1783. I understand WHY they would choose such an astronomical representation to symbolize independence and separation, but the fact is that most people are completely unaware of this, that which is an astoundingly important point of history, is beyond the grasp of the mass of the population, even most alternative view points and information sources do not touch upon this. it is certainly no coincidence. Everyone should be aware of this and all other truths that root our history. I use this as a simple example of the many things that people BELIEVE that they know, which have no real basis in truth, just mere conventional wisdom. If people do not know the truth about THIS, imagine what else people think they know that is complete and utter fiction, or as this is, not exactly as it has been explained. Share and enjoy this tid bit of information and introduce people to the truth of their country'sÂ  founding. Things like this undoubtedly inspire people to question EVERYTHING ELSE that they are told, an to learn not to take ANYTHING at face value. There is ALWAYS a much deeper story beneath what lies on the surface, as they are ALL lies, on the surface, hiding the truths that await discovery beneath for those with the desire to learn and the inherent NEED to know the truth. After all, how important is it to know the truth about ANYTHING/EVERYTHING? To me it is imperative.<br />
