Note from Author:  As a newspaper writer and observer of FRCOG for several years,   I see a growing danger from these NGO’s as they begin to assume more and more of the government functions.  In my discussions with my friends and associates from all over the country,  I hear more and more tales of how these NGO’s are taking over,  dictating  property usage, tax valuations and using environmental concerns to validate their specific agendas.  The total lack of accountability is what bothers me the most.  It is my hope that this essay can shed some light on some of the serious trends that NGO’s are setting around the country, provide some insight into their methodologies, and inform the general public about the issue.
 
                                             Strangling of Small Town America:
                                 The Abolition of Individual Property Rights by
                                   Non-Governmental Special Interest Groups
                                                           By Rachel J. Roy
 
Route 2 scenically winds it’s way through the hills of Western Massachusetts.  Lined on both sides by the local tourist traps and small agribusinesses, it connects the formerly industrial towns of Greenfield and North Adams.  The views are stunning as you wind your way west; large open pastures often teeming with burgeoning populations of native turkeys, cows and corn dotting the grassy slopes as the spires of historic churches vibrate with the hymns
of our Puritan ancestors played two or three times daily to remind local residents of their roots.   
       Various rivers and brooks border the road, and travelers catch frequent glimpses of the rafters, kayakers and tubers who play in the clean rapids. The  inviting cool waters seem to bring out the child in all who bathe in them,  as their strains of laughter trail along behind their rapidly vanishing watercraft.
      This road, known as the Mohawk Trail, was also the trail used by the first Americans to inhabit the area, the native tribes who frequently traveled between upper New York State and the rich salmon fisheries of Turners Falls and Shelburne Falls.  These were treaty areas, areas of peace and plenty, where native tribes agreed to live harmoniously as they all fished for the nutritious salmon that provided a main staple of their hunter/gatherer diets.   
      Supplemented by the corn, squash and pumpkins that they grew in their open fields,  and also by the plentiful  venison, turkey and wild birds that frequented the area,  these native tribes were able to provide their families with a nutritious diet during the long cold winters.
      An aura of peaceful harmony permeated these benevolent hills back then, and has managed to continue to do so over the passing centuries of European settlement.  Fields that once provided fodder for deer and turkey, remain open as pastures for cows and sheep, and corn still lines the open slopes and river valleys of the area.  The gently intertwined needs of humans and animals continue to cohabitate in relative balance, even today,  with pressure of growing populations and economic decline.
 
THE BATTLE FOR CONTROL
 
One would hardly guess that there is a raging land use battle going on over these quiet open spaces, one in which the agenda of a few threatens to take away the personal property rights of all the landowners and price the property out of the reach of all but a few wealthy  residents.  And further research reveals that this movement is in process in small towns all over the rural United States.
     Under the relatively new land use movement known as Smart Growth, a group of like-minded individuals have appointed themselves as the guardians of “Open Space” and have hijacked the local planning and zoning boards in order to promote their vision of land use over that of those who have owned and maintained it for the past few generations.   
      Here in Franklin County,  as in growing numbers of small towns across the United  States, this group has formed a non-governmental unit called the Franklin Regional Council of Governments, (FRCOG) which has stacked it’s boards with local town officials.  They apply for grants that appear to provide much needed funding for  cash-strapped  small town road and civic projects.  Each grant has budgeted funding for grant administration, and FRCOG becomes partners with the town in the allocation and tracking of these funds.
    At first glance, this symbiosis seems to be a hugely beneficial partnership for the town and the non-governmental group.  The town gets funding for their projects,  and they do not have to spend limited tax monies to fill out time-consuming grant forms or  to meet the extensive financial reporting requirements of government grants.  In return, the non-governmental group, in this case, FRCOG, gets the funding they need to keep their offices  open and their well-paid staff, employed.  However, the danger becomes apparent as this group begins to get grants to finance formerly elected town positions, such as board of health or planning board or zoning board members.
        As elected officials, these boards are normally staffed by personnel who are elected by the general population, or directly appointed by the town selectmen.  They are accountable to the town meeting members.
       FRCOG  employees are none of the above.  Since upper level town officials are on their Board of Directors, they are often loathe to oppose FRCOG common practices since they think that such opposition could jeopardize future funding of town projects.  They are lulled into thinking that this group is not subject to open meeting laws and practices, since they are not a governmental board or elected unit and as such, they are not legally accountable for actions which are taken in the course of their  projects.
    Citizens who oppose actions taken by NGO’s,  have no recourse to appeal  except through costly and lengthly legal battles, in which or there is little or no precedent set to put the reins of local control back into the process. 
      The smell of corruption frequently pervades the actions of NGO’s such as FRCOG.    Reporting only to town selectmen, frequently who are also members of their board of directors, these groups usurp the democratic process of open discussion and deny local citizens the right to participate in the processes they control.  They eliminate the checks and balances normally provided by our democratic constitution. 
     The Ad Hoc committees they frequently form, to supposedly advise them, are stacked with like-minded individuals who have a particular agenda or approach in mind as they formulate policies and procedures that used to have open discussion and input mandated prior to the Annual Town Meeting Vote.  And in the particular case of Shelburne, this total lack of public input, seriously violates the spirit and the nature of a small town, steeped in the history of the American Revolution which occurred to protect their personal property rights.
     One has to wonder why the sudden interest in Open Space preservation has become such an issue in a place that so clearly already knows and practices healthy open space management.  A look at the socioeconomic changes that are occurring in the area point out the growing influx of wealthy New Yorkers and outsiders who come from more urban areas and believe that once they arrive, nothing should ever change.
 
                                              Shelburne and FRCOG….Partners in?
 
<ul><li>In 2005, FRCOG obtained a $24,000 grant to help the town of Shelburne review it’s zoning bylaws.</li>
<li>Working with a nebulous “ad hoc” committee, this money was almost entirely spent cutting and pasting land use regulations from the SmartGrowth Toolkit into new regulations, some of which the town had voted to exclude three times in the past ten years.</li>
<li>When a group of concerned citizens became aware of this and attempted to examine the new body of regulations as well as the process used to develop them, they were told that this “Ad Hoc”  group was not subject to the state open meeting laws and practices.</li>
<li>Assistant District Attorney, Cynthia Pepyne informed the group that FRCOG was not subject to Open Meeting Law.  When questioned as to who controls the actions of this group, Ms. Pepyne urged the group to speak to their town officials as she did not know.</li>
<li>To date, there has been no information provided as to the ad hoc advisory group membership or the minutes or records to the meetings in which $24,000 of town grant money was spent.</li>
<li>A quick telephone survey of over 140 businesses indicated that only three were aware of the changes that were about to be proposed, and all three businesses were owned or staffed by the members of this as yet unnamed  “Ad hoc” group.</li>
<li>As the group pressed further, FRCOG announced that they were withdrawing the grant money from the town, blaming a “lack of progress due to questioning of process over focusing on accomplishments” as their reason for doing so.</li>
</ul> 
      Town  natives understand the nature and charm of their rural environment, but are frequently subjected to comments like “you people don’t understand what you have here” when indeed the local depth of understanding goes into their daily farm chores and maintenance as well as their rapidly rising tax bills.  The increasing resentment against these know-it-all outsiders is expressed in a growing insularization of social strata, with very clear lines drawn between the old-timers and the newcomers.
      A healthy suspicion has grown when a newcomer joins several town boards expressing the commonly held local understanding that life here has been the way it is for over a century and change does not come easy to the hills of Franklin County, as in several other similar small rural towns across our vast country.  But here, as in many other places, the rural folk are often so caught up in the work of daily living, that the larger view escapes them. 
      Slick city operators with deep pockets find it easy to use their well-established tactics to achieve their goals at the expense of the struggling farmers.  They waggle open wallets disguised as government programs and manage to convince these insulated people that their  regulations will keep life as it has always been. 
      The nouveau riche of the hills are frequently natives who went off to college and jobs in the city and return to find that the hometown is actually  beginning to change with the times.  Secure in their inherited properties and trust funds, they seek to regulate out the change so their bucolic existences remain as they have always known them.  They purchase the struggling farms, put up the “No Trespassing” signs,  and slap them under the various “preservation” programs, hoping to enjoy all the benefits of the property ownership with little or none of the tax and insurance bills.  And they seek to legislate public funding for  maintenance of these properties, forgetting that  their ancestors worked the land by hand to achieve the open space and manicured beauty that they seek to preserve with no personal effort of their own. 
      Under the guise of “site plan review” they espouse a dedication to the preservation of open space and lands that many acknowledge as pristine habitats for various species.  But make no mistake, if any economic impact can benefit them, they are quick to take advantage of it while working to lock out any others who might draw the benefits before them.
      Twisting the words and intent of our U.S. Constitution, they attempt to explain that land use and accompanying regulations are the will of the majority, although the majority is often a very few vocal souls who loudly contort and influence the more quiet and less savvy masses who own and maintain this apparently valuable resource that has now become the property of the collective state rather than the individual.
      They create wordy confusing zoning laws, such as the “right to farm” bylaw and the site plan review process, each step of which is designed to confuse and confound the normal person to the point where they throw up their hands in despair and pay exorbitant attorney fees to do what was always allowed in the past by the local town zoning boards of appeal.
      These NGO’s take the individual decisions from duly elected officials and replace them with laborious legal wordings and then explain to townspeople that the regulations have become so complex that experts are needed to do what has always been done by common sense in the past.
      Everything begins to become a committee decision, thereby absolving any one person of official responsibility for any unpopular moves.  We are seeing the rise of agricultural commissions, open space management committees, scenic byway review committees, river and waterway advocate committees, historical structure commissions, etc, etc, etc.  Each new committee comes with a new body of regulations, all of which are researched, funded and developed by the local NGO.
      Do we need to get rid of the NGO’s and get back to the daily common sense methodologies developed by local residents for centuries?  Or are these new entities to become a new form of governance, severely restricting the rights so many of us have taken for granted for so many years?
      Only time and a persistent monitoring of these NGO’s will tell.  In the meantime, small town American citizens must carefully watch these special interest machines before they lose what is left of their rapidly diminishing personal property rights.
 
                  The Anatomy of The Tactics Used to Circumvent Local Opposition
<ol><li>After years of observation, it has become apparent that there is a very set approach to be used when major change is desired by this group and they know that local opposition will prevent easy accomplishment of such.  Generally, they start by presentation of an idea to the local Board of Selectmen.</li>
<li>They inform the Board that there is a grant available to provide funding for the project and they obtain the permission of the Board to apply for the funds for the town.</li>
<li>They become the consultants to the town for the project.</li>
<li>For many of the grants, where extensive public participation is desired and required by grant guidelines, “unofficial ad hoc working groups” are formed and all the work is done under closed doors with little or no reporting to the general population.  </li>
<li>Appointments to the Ad Hoc groups are somewhat confusing and frequently there is no requirement for participation other than mutual interest in the topic and recruitment occurs via word of mouth.  </li>
<li>Frequently, these projects are poorly publicized, and FRCOG and the town officials who advocate for them state, “Well, we looked for people to participate, but nobody did.  When examined more closely, it is generally apparent that the call for interested volunteers was minimal at best, and provided very little information as to what the work of the committee would actually be.  Therefore, these ad hoc groups are frequently staffed by the same group of people and there is little or no opposition to whatever approach is advocated.</li>
<li>Most of the grants require public hearings in which information about the process and the plans are shared with the general public.  Although these meetings are posted on the Town Hall Bulletin Board as required by law, there is little or no press coverage or other information passed along prior to the meeting.  </li>
<li>These information sessions are carefully staged with only presentation of the positive impacts of the proposed changes and little or no discussion of adverse impact.</li>
<li>Very little time is allotted for public input, and generally that is only allowed at the end of the session.  By that time, most people have forgotten what they wanted to speak about and the meeting is adjourned with little or no discussion.</li>
<li>True objections are voiced, but not acted upon.  Instead, they proceed with the project using what they deem to be ";acceptable workarounds";.</li>
<li>Upon fulfillment of the grant requirements, the new legislation is presented to Town Meeting with careful placement on the agenda to assure the least amount of opposition.</li>
<li>Using this methodology, most motions made are passed quickly with little or no discussion and it is not until later analysis that people realize the implications of what they have passed and how it will directly impact upon them.</li>
<li>A relatively new tactic is to write in language that prevents recall of the motion or change for a period of several years….and again, this is rarely discussed in public meeting and since most people do not read carefully, they do not truly realize that the motion will have longer term effects than usual.</li>
</ol>
