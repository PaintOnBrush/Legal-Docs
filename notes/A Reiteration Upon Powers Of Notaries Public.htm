A comment that became so important it warranted becoming a post/ its own thread, as well as a separate file. People MUST learn and understand the power of the Notary and Sheriff and then must make regular use of that power in defense of their rights. *********************************************************************************************** In 1 sense Kenneth is correct. The Notary like the peace officer, holds a position of DUALITY. The Notary in 1 sense IS a defacto agent, but in another is something else. It is true that you can create anything a notary can with the assistance of 3 upstanding members of the community, but 1 advantage to using a Notary properly, so long as you also specifically define their role as the position of COMMON LAW that they are, is that the Notary is ALSO a JUDGE and if you use the process properly. The COMMON LAW procedure of DIISCUSSION, through the use of what are known as NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS, like drafts, checks, notes, notices, and BILLS OF EXCHANGE, which are what the notices I have people use qualify as, BEING the specific realm OF the Notary Public, the notary public in their COMMON LAW CAPACTY as a JUSTICE ranked ABOVE a justice of the SUPREME COURT with respect to these matters of non contention, where there is NO dispute, is lawfully able to grant AND ENTER / RECORD judgments related to this process of discussion. *********************************************************************************************** It is wise to be aware of the potential of defacto impropriety, however it is UNWISE to abandon a simple and extremely effective common law procedure which carries REAL lawful weight even in these defacto courts, simply because one is UNAWARE of their ability to restrict the role of the Notary and confine them within their common law capacity. Using this process properly further gives you a passport, a greencard, lawful proper authority to pass the BAR an PRESENT yourself SUI URIS in ANY court, and thereby the manner of your presentation defines the court itself as a common law court. ALL courts are courts of common law. Like the Notary, the court itself has been merged into a role of duality. But first and foremost, just as a COP is FIRST a PEACE OFFICER and SECOND a policy code enforcement officer, and a Notary Public is FIRST a common law justice ranked above a justice of the supreme court and second a defacto agent of executive commercial office, the court itself is also FIRST a court of LAW, of land, and only then SECOND a court of EQUITY. of water, of Maritime admiralty. *********************************************************************************************** The key in differentiation is to make certn that you NEVER step INTO maritime admiralty. This is rather simple as you can only do so of your own signed consent. Most people are simply ignorant as to how it is that they give this consent, that consent is therefore inherently void, but only if they are aware and able to belligerently assert their Si Juris RIGHT in PERSON. Rights are not afforded to the passive or ignorant, nor those indifferent thereto but ONLY to those who INSIST upon them. RIGHTS are a FIGHTING CLAUSE that can ONLY be retained by SUSTAINED COMBAT. If one is persuaded to for example, incriminate themselves and answer questions, rather than make a last ditch stand upon their right to refuse, they simply lose that protection. These facts are forever immortalized in common law as cite below. The citation below it is true specifically refers only to the right to refuse to incriminate one's self, hoever the truth obviated by it is that this ruling applies to ANY and ALL rights one could ever claim. I have already long established powers of Notary Public. So I will not reinvent the wheel here on that note. This comment is now too important to allow to disappear. It will become a main post and the file. *********************************************************************************************** ";The privilege against self-incrimination is neither accorded to the passive resistant, nor to the person who is ignorant of his rights, nor to one indifferent thereto. It is a FIGHTING clause. It's benefits can be retained only by sustained COMBAT. It cannot be claimed by attorney or solicitor. It is valid only when insisted upon by a BELLIGERENT claimant in person."; McAlister vs. Henkel, 201 U.S. 90, 26 S.Ct. 385, 50 L.Ed. 671; Commonwealth vs. Shaw, 4 Cush. 594, 50 Am.Dec. 813; ***********************************************************************************************  The one who is persuaded by honeyed words or moral suasion to testify or produce documents rather than make a last ditch stand, simply loses the protection. He must refuse to answer or produce, and test the matter in contempt proceedings, or by habeas corpus."; Orum vs. State, 38 Ohio App. 171, 175 N.E. 876.<br />
