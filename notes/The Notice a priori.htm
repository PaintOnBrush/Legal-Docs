Notice a priori to Consideration of Restated Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus
This Notice a priori provides an overview of issues akin to definitions related to the accompanying Restated Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, and is provided at the same time to the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska and the Respondents and other Interested Parties.
 
I.  Related US Supreme Court Rulings
 
            Two US Supreme Court cases are often cited in support of federal claims that state courts do not have the power to exercise the writ of habeas corpus to release (Alaskans) from detention by federal officers.
            Ableman v. Booth  in 1859 involved release of a newspaper editor who had been arrested for interfering in the apprehension of a runaway slave by a federal officer enforcing the Fugitive Slave Law.   Fugitive slaves were viewed as contraband being smuggled across state lines, a matter clearly subject to regulation by Congress under the Interstate Commerce Clause.   A person aiding smugglers of contraband across state lines then as now is lawfully liable to arrest and detention by the federal government exercising its authority to regulate interstate commerce.   The newspaper editor in this case was formally arrested, charged, and then subjected to detention.  
            The Tarbel’s Case in 1871 involved the enrollment of an under-age boy in the US military and his father’s efforts to force the military to release the boy after his induction.   The US Supreme Court ruled that the state court could not use habeas corpus to force the boy’s release.    The boy willfully, knowingly, and under conditions of full disclosure entered federal jurisdiction and the jurisdiction claimed him.   Then as now, there is no “age limit” on voluntary submission to federal jurisdiction and the US military is clearly a federal jurisdiction.
            In both instances a well-established, activated, and explicitly granted federal jurisdiction was involved----interstate commerce in one case, the US military in the other.   In both cases, the US Supreme Court took pains to describe the supremacy of federal law over that of the States when a clearly demonstrated federal jurisdiction exists.  
            No such federal jurisdiction exists at this time with respect to the Patriot Act or NDAA (2012).
            In the absence of an “armed and organized” domestic insurrection there is no federal jurisdiction allowing domestic use of war powers nor any federal jurisdiction allowing suspension of due process owed State Citizens within the 50 States United.  
            The American Civil War was the last armed and organized insurrection, which provides the context necessary for the exercise of the underlying federal jurisdiction.   Unless the South should rise again, or a similar armed struggle be engaged, the federal government is not allowed to exercise federal war powers in domestic venues. Equally, lacking the same requirement, there is no federal jurisdiction allowing suspension of any element of due process owed to State Citizens. (The Suspension Clause allows suspension of habeas corpus during an armed and organized domestic insurrection, but it is the only element of due process lawfully subject to suspension.)
            The potential existence of a federal jurisdiction does not create or empower it.
            Without an explicit and active federal jurisdiction in evidence, state courts including the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska are fully empowered to use a writ of habeas corpus to demand release of State Citizens detained by the federal government, just as they always have been.   The States of New York and Pennsylvania moreover allow the injunctive use of the writ for this purpose. The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, are owed Equal Protection and have asked for it.  
            The US Supreme Court has never ruled on the use of writ of habeas corpus by a state court to protect State Citizens in any case where (1) only a potential federal jurisdiction exists and (2) other explicit guarantees of both the state and federal Constitutions with respect to State Citizens are jointly infringed. 
            We are on uncharted ground.
 
II. Logic
            The common defense mandate of the Constitution of the United States of America cannot be upheld by destroying other constitutional mandates of equal importance.  The right to due process is the universal requirement of a just society and without justice no society is safe or at peace.  The right to contract is even more fundamental, if possible.  No lawful government exists without the right to contract, so we are left with a scenario in which the federal government proposes to protect people by destroying its own basis for existence. 
            All non-despotic forms of government are created and instituted for the purpose of protecting the property rights of the citizens, principally expressed as life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. It is as valid to ask ---what life can be enjoyed without liberty? ---as it is to ask, what liberty can be enjoyed without life?  Or can we pursue happiness without both life and liberty?
            The answer is self-evident.  Preserving life is no end unto itself.  We cannot successfully or for long sacrifice one value for the others, thus no single mandate of the Constitution of the United States of America can be said to be preeminent and any codification in law favoring one over the others must be resisted. Americans have never hesitated to sacrifice life for liberty, and no new national character favoring life at the expense of liberty may be presumed.
            Mohandas K. Gandhi said, “An unjust law is an act of violence.”  This, too, is self-evidently true. We are born with the intrinsic right to be free and to do what we like so long as we are not harming someone else or preventing them from doing the same.  All lawful government, all law, all sane society strives merely to preserve our natural freedom within this simple framework of non-aggression. What can we expect, when the government instituted to preserve our freedom, becomes the aggressor against it? Violence is what we can expect, the exact opposite of the “public safety” being promoted by the supporters of the Patriot Act and the offending provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012.
            It is unjust to indefinitely detain anyone without recourse to due process of law, based merely on the suspicion that he or she may have committed undefined “belligerent acts” against the government. It is similarly unjust to deny the protection of one’s citizenship on such a basis and then use that as an excuse for indefinite detainment.  Detainment is universally recognized as a punishment. America’s vast prison industry and statutory court system stand as a testament to the fact that we use detainment as punishment. Punishing people without proof that they have done anything wrong is injustice by definition.  It is an act of violence against them and can only expect to promote more violence in return, not less.  The codification in law of any such practice is deeply repugnant to logic.  By enacting the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) indefinite detainment provisions against the Petitioners, the Respondents are codifying injustice as law.
 
 
 
            
III. The Outlined Assertions 
<ol><li>There exist State Citizens, US citizens, and Non-foreign citizens, each naturally inhabiting different jurisdictions--- State, Federal, and International, respectively.</li>
<li>The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, include citizens native to all three jurisdictions.</li>
<li>Federal jurisdiction applies only to “US citizens” generally, and can only be asserted over State Citizens if and when they (1) knowingly, willingly, and under conditions of full disclosure submit themselves to Federal jurisdiction or (2) under the same conditions engage in federally regulated interstate trade, or (3) undergo formal conversion via Public Law, Revised Statute 2561.  </li>
<li>There are two entities calling themselves the “United States of America” in common legal parlance: (1) the 50 States United, and (2) the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, et alia.  Both entities are administered by the US Congress.  This circumstance has resulted in gross Confusion at Law.</li>
<li>The Congress in its dual role is required to administer the government of the 50 States United under contract and within the limitations set by the Constitution of the United States of America, and at the same time, Congress rules as an oligarchy over the Commonwealth entity also calling itself the “United States of America”.  </li>
<li>Congress passes legislation related to both entities. Rule 54(c) of the Federal Criminal Code reveals that an “Act of Congress” applies only to the “District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, et alia” yet many Acts of Congress have been presumed against the Citizens of the 50 States United---for example, the Internal Revenue Act.  </li>
<li>This confusion regarding which hat the Congress is wearing and which “United States of America” is the rightful subject of any given piece of legislation has been a convenient and profitable means to derogate the guaranteed rights of the American State Citizens in the past, per above.</li>
<li>It is by no means clear to the public or to law enforcement or court officials that these current Acts of Congress, the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012), are not meant to apply to State Citizens inhabiting the 50 States United, and in the absence of that common understanding, the Petitioners must conclude that the Respondents are presuming enforcement against them, just as they have presumed to enforce other Acts of Congress against State Citizens.   </li>
<li>While this legislation may be “lawful” within the “District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, et alia” version of “United States of America” and as applied to “US citizens”, it is self-evidently not lawful within the 50 States United when presumed against the State Citizens who are contractually guaranteed the protections of the Constitution of the United States of America.</li>
<li>As the Internal Revenue Act has proven, the lack of lawful applicability of an “Act of Congress” within the 50 States United has not provided any protection against unlawful enforcement and presumption against State Citizens. Millions of Americans who are not lawfully required to pay the Federal Income Tax have been presumed against in precisely this manner and subjected to unlawful enforcement by the Respondents. There is no reason to think that in the absence of full and public explication otherwise, these current repugnant Acts will not similarly be improperly presumed and enforced. </li>
<li>Since 1933 the “Federal government” has operated as a corporate entity per Title 5 of the US Code and the “States” have functioned as municipal franchise corporations.  The organic document known as “The Constitution for the united States of America” was translated into the commercial contract known as “The Constitution of the United States of America”. Laws and agreements established by the original Constitution(s) both federal and state, remain enforceable and are enforced as contracts and as public policies.  </li>
<li>In 1938, the States and the “citizenry thereof” were entered into receivership related to the still ongoing public bankruptcy of the “United States of America” defined as “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, et alia”.  The then-State Governors pledged the “full faith and credit” of their “States and the citizenry thereof” in support of the bankrupt entity and entered the public bankruptcy as adjuncts to it. </li>
<li>This has created the presumption that the Petitioners, State Citizens, are bankrupts, and therefore unable to exercise their natural sovereignty and prerogatives at law.  They cannot establish standing or support a Petition on its merits without removing that presumption.  </li>
<li>Bankruptcy is a voluntary legal procedure that cannot be entered without knowing and willing consent.  Similarly, credit is an individual property interest that cannot be lawfully exercised without consent.   Sean Parnell cannot enter the Petitioners into bankruptcy, nor can he exercise their personal credit to buy himself a new Lexus.  What is true now was also true in 1933. </li>
<li>Any entry of the (now 50) States and the Petitioners into the public bankruptcy of the “United States of America” by the State Governors in 1933 was fraud on the face of it.  </li>
<li>The Governors acting at that time  (1) had no granted Authority to take such action, (2) had no sufficient individual material interest to back the  claim in equity, (3) never disclosed the resulting non-sovereign status of the States, the State Citizens, and the “United States of America” in receivership (4) never disclosed the resulting “unlimited debt accrual’ against the States and the State Citizens by Foreign Creditors and  their Agents, (5) never received consent from the State Citizens via referendum or other valid and fully disclosed public process. </li>
<li>As it was fraud then, it is fraud now. </li>
<li>The States and the State Citizens involved in this fraudulently imposed bankruptcy lost all claim to sovereignty as a result of it, and the new corporate structures, as legal fictions, could not exercise sovereignty either. America defined as the 50 States United has not functioned as a Sovereign nation for almost 80 years. As presumed Bankrupts, the States and the State Citizens have been viewed as “wards” of the Trustees acting in receivership. </li>
<li>In removing the presumption that they are or ever were legitimately parties to the bankruptcy of the “United States of America” the State Citizens, Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, represent the “Last Man Standing” as by subrogation, they represent the only remaining Sovereign parties to the commercial contract known as the Constitution of the United States of America. </li>
<li>They are fully enabled to recall the natural jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska and to demand performance under contract from the Respondents, or to be more exact, the Trustees and the Foreign Agents acting in their behalf. </li>
<li>The federal government has since promoted the use of undisclosed contracts, coercion, and semantic deceits to force State Citizens into federal jurisdiction and to advance the self-interested claim that State Citizens are “US citizens”.  The resulting adhesion contracts have been used as a secondary and superficial means to deny the sovereignty of the State Citizens and to further derogate their immunity from related presumptions. </li>
<li>No valid contract can be asserted under conditions of non-disclosure and coercion.  No valid contract can be asserted under conditions of adhesion. None of these purported “voluntary” entries into federal jurisdiction represented by participation in the Social Security programs or other purported “Agency” relationships have ever been fully disclosed, and were certainly not disclosed to the Petitioners who are State Citizens. </li>
<li>No claim that the State Citizens are rendered “US citizens” or placed under federal jurisdiction on the basis of their participation in any federal program can be supported absent their knowing and willing consent under conditions of full disclosure and as asserted under Public Law, recorded as Revised Statute 2561.  None of their “rights” can be deemed as “waived” in the absence of full disclosure. No “voluntary” entry into federal jurisdiction can be claimed without full disclosure. </li>
<li>Adhesion contracts are unlawful by their nature and cannot be presumed to be valid once the gross inequity involved is clearly demonstrated.  The Buck Act enacted by the Respondents in 1940 provides convincing proof that no fully informed State Citizen would willingly or knowingly subject themselves to “US citizenship” or any generalized claim of federal jurisdiction under conditions of full disclosure.  The Buck Act overtly claims that “US citizens” are “property” of the federal government----publicly owned slaves.  It is inconceivable and logically insupportable that any State Citizen would knowingly and willingly descend from a condition of freedom to a condition of slavery.  Any purported contract exposing them to such claim that they are slaves, owned as franchises by the federal government, is an adhesion contract by definition and its assertion is unlawful. </li>
<li>As a result of these actions, claims, and presumptions undertaken by the Respondents, the Petitioners and their immediate Progenitors have been wrongfully deprived of both their property and the exercise of their sovereignty, amounting to gross restraint under color of law. </li>
<li>Fraud vitiates everything resulting from it without regard for any statute of limitation. </li>
<li>All non-disclosed contracts, all actions and legal presumptions predicated on fraud, all non-contractual claims against the Petitioners’ credit and other property interests, are null and void ab initio </li>
<li> The 50 incorporated States and by subrogation, the Petitioners, are owed the protections of The Constitution of the United States of America.  Petitioners are additionally owed enforcement and all the similar guarantees of the Constitution of the State of Alaska. </li>
<li>“US citizens” are owed civil rights equal to those of State Citizens. </li>
<li>Non-foreign citizens are owed all the protections of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the “United States of America” signed in 1948, or in the case of some American Indian Tribes, separate but similar guarantees secured by treaty. </li>
<li>There is no contractual authority or resulting federal jurisdiction enabling the federal government to generally suspend due process within the 50 States United, nor deny any element of due process to State Citizens in the absence of an armed and organized domestic insurrection. </li>
<li>There is likewise no contractual authority or resulting federal jurisdiction allowing the federal government to indefinitely detain any State Citizen on the basis of unproven allegations.</li>
<li>The exercise of the writ of habeas corpus in favor of the Petitioners by a state court cannot be interpreted as an opposition to any federal supremacy in the absence of an active federal jurisdiction.</li>
<li>The abuses of Due Process and personal liberty represented by the offending provisions of the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) are not contractually allowed within the 50 States United and cannot be lawfully enforced against State Citizens by any amount of presumption.  </li>
<li>A state court acting to support protections overtly guaranteed to State Citizens by both the state and federal governments cannot be subject to reproof on the basis of any federal jurisdiction or supremacy that is contrary and applicable to State Citizens.   That is, issuance of a writ of habeas corpus by a state court to protect State Citizens does not in itself infringe upon Congress’s ability to abuse “US citizens” and others in its jurisdiction. In this regard, the jurisdictions stand separated. </li>
</ol> 
IV.  Equal Protection, the Great Writ in other States.
 
            The habeas corpus rules of New York and Pennsylvania allow for considerably more inclusive and broader application of the writ of habeas corpus.  These states apply the legal definition of “detainment” as any restraint of liberty, not necessarily arising from incarceration, and use the writ to relieve a wide variety of infringements and restraints upon personal liberty.  The application of the writ of habeas corpus according to the rules and definitions of these other states fully allows the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska to address and mediate all forms of restraint, including unlawful restraint of our credit, our sovereignty, and our physical bodies.  The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, are owed equal protection under the law and have asked for it accordingly.   
            As a Petition for Writ this action is specifically guaranteed by the Constitution of the State of Alaska and is not subject to abridgement.   The Restated Petition is addressed to the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska as a whole, meaning that each judicial Office held by individual Justices is addressed individually and in sum.  Like a letter addressed to separate persons but calling for a joint action, it cannot be answered by the consideration of a single Justice.
            Petitioners are seeking the lawful and peaceful mediation of the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska to resolve these issues and remove these unlawful restraints.
