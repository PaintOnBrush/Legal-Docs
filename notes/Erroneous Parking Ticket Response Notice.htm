NOTICE OF CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE / NOTICE OF DISCHARGE BY WAY OF SEEKINGCLARIFICATION/NOTICE OF FEE SCHEDULE ACTIVATION
Notice to agent is notice to principal, notice to principal is notice to agent.
Affected parties wishing to dispute the claims made herein or make their own counterclaims must respond appropriately within FIFTEEN (15) days of service of notice. ALL responses MUST be submitted under oath and of penalty of perjury.
I am in receipt of your Notice of Impending Default Judgement which arrived in my name to my mother's house at 80 Riverdale Avenue Buffalo NY 14207-1037. Notice date 05-11-2012, My name IS Robert, Johnson, however there seems to be a monumental error. The primary flaw in your notice is that the car in question as identified on the notice by license plate # DWM 4569, does not belong to me, nor have I ever been on Cary street in Buffalo in my entire life, and on 04-15-2012 at 3:10 AM the date and time of the alleged violation, I was at my domicile in the area commonly known as Orchard Park, asleep in my bed. I am responding to your notice under protest and duress and my responses in no way are to be construed as the creation of any contractual relationship.
I am innocent of the alleged charges in your notice, however entering a plead of either guilty or not guilty is entirely premature and improper. First I am not even accused of a crime here, but the violation of a contractual agreement. Entering a plea is only proper in a criminal case where there is an actual complaining party establising standing and corpus delicti under oath.  I am not entering a plea at this time and this message cannot be construed to be the entering of ANY plea or contract nor consent to jurisdiction. I am not going to beg of the court to not have to pay, but I am also not going to beg of the court to be able to just pay, I have no intentions of begging at all. I will not be dishonoring myself by claiming either to be not guilty OR guilty, not guilded or guilded. I am offering discussion honorably here to attempt to avoid conflict, which leads to court. I am offering conditional acceptance in that if you can provide me with a signed original bill and a copy of the lawful two party contract that makes me liable to pay it I will happily do so. I sincerely wish you luck in providing me a document with my signature on it related to the registration contract identified by registration TAX ID (plate) DWM 4569.
I accept your notice and greatly apreciate you attempting to enter discussion with me over this matter that appears to be very important to you, but your notice is not very clear. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE CAUSE AND NATURE OF THE CHARGES AND OR PROCEEDINGS TO FOLLOW AGAINST ME IN THIS MATTER This notice is the first communication I have received from you regarding this matter. As the car in question identified by license plate DWM 4569  does not and has never belonged to me nor in my possession, nor am I aware of even who the owner is, I assume the first notice was the ticket left on the car, which could not possibly have ever been in my possession nor bear my signature as the car again, does not belong to me, nor is it registered to me. I am not a signatory to the registration contract in question's terms and conditions therefor cannot be bound by or forced to abide the terms and conditions of that registration contract. Because I am not in contract with you, you can place no orders upon me as you have done.
In addition to responding under protest and duress I have activated my fee schedule in this matter out of fear of undue repercussions against me from your department, my fee schedule for rights violations and being forced to act under protest and duress is on file with the county. I charge 1,000.00 per hour or portion thereof just to talk to agents of the State regarding statutory compliance matters to which I am not a bound party. I also charge 5,000.00 per hour or portin thereof if I am forced to appear in a court or forcibly restrained and or transported.  I have spent 2 hours putting together this response to your notice and this notice is now also a bill for $2,000.00 per my fee schedule. Your balance is 2000.00 and it must be paid with in 30 days. I am not waiving any rights in this notice I am exercising my duty to reserve all of my rights, and if forced to make an appearance regarding this matter I will be making special appearance to challenge jurisdiction. Thank you for your time and cooperation in this matter, please see billing information below.
