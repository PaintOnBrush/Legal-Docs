PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
I. General Information Pursuant to Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus
A. Place of confinement:  State of ________________________
B. Petitioner’s institutional address: (At least one Named Petitioner’s physical address.  Mailing and contract information will be part of the Court Docket, a simple form that you will file along with this petition)
 
II. SUBJECT OF THIS PETITION
A. Indicate the type of decision or action which you are challenging:
__________ Denial of parole
__________ Revocation of parole
__________ Disciplinary matter
__________ Revocation of good time credits
__________ Detainer
__________ Immigration or deportation order
_____X_____ Other (described briefly the type of decision or action involved)
 
This petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus is presented seeking injunctive relief from the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 (NDAA).  These Acts of Congress conspire in such a way that the Petitioners and other ______________ can now be (1) accused of undefined acts of “terrorism” and stripped of their citizenship and indefinitely detained under the Patriot Act and (2) subjected to indefinite detention without recourse to Due Process under the National Defense Authorization Act (2012), such that this Writ of Habeas Corpus and other means of relief would no longer be available to Petitioner(s) if they were physically confined..
 
Under the Patriot Act an ______________ can conceivably be “deemed” an “enemy combatant” for almost any infraction, stripped of their citizenship and detained indefinitely, because the subject of the legislation, “terrorism”, is left to the interpretation of law enforcement agencies. The National Defense Authorization Act further allows the military to indefinitely detain ________________________ merely under suspicion and does not require them to provide Due Process of Law.  
 
 An __________________ thus accused of “terrorism” whatever “terrorism” is “deemed” to mean by whatever local authority may be asserted to make that determination, may be denied their right to contract, stripped of their citizenship and its protections under the Patriot Act, and arbitrarily and indefinitely detained, creating the possibility that an __________________ could receive the administrative equivalent of a sentence of life imprisonment with no recourse to Due Process of Law.
 
Similarly, an ________________ could become subject to unlawful indefinite detention without recourse to Due Process of Law under the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012. 
 
The potential for abuse inherent in these combined Acts is enormous.  Only the Alaska Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to provide relief and protection for Inhabitants of ______________ by issuing a Writ of Habeas Corpus.
 
B. Who made the decision or took the action?  The United States as represented by various members of the United States Congress, including (?) members of the _______________ US  Senate Delegation, ______________________________, and US Congress Members: __________________________________________________________
 
C. Date of decision or action?   The Patriot Act has been enrolled since 2002, and was extended in 2011 for four more years.  The National Defense Authorization Act (2012) has passed both Houses of Congress, with approval by ______________________________________________, as of December 15, 2011 and signed into law by US President Barack H. Obama on December 31, 2011.
 
D. Was there a hearing of any kind? Yes ( ) No (X )
 
E. Were you represented by counsel or a staff member at any hearing?
Yes ( ) No (X )
 
F. Have you filed any previous lawsuit(s) related to your present claim?
Yes ( ) No (X )
 
 
Justification of Filing and Establishment of Standing and Jurisdiction
In Brown v. Vasquez, 952 F.2d 1164, 1166 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 1778 (1992), the court observed that the Supreme Court has ";recognized the fact that`[t]he writ of habeas corpus is the fundamental instrument for safeguarding individual freedom against arbitrary and lawless state action.' Harris  v. Nelson,  394 U.S. 286, 290-91 (1969). Therefore, the writ must be ";administered with the initiative and flexibility essential to insure that miscarriages of justice within its reach are surfaced and corrected."; Harris, 394 U.S. at 291.
The Petitioners hereby asserted their right to contract and to receive due process of law, among other rights guaranteed and secured by public contract with the State of ________, Inc., and by subrogation also guaranteed and secured by public contract with the “United States of America”, aka, the “US Corporation.”  Petitioners have demonstrated that material harm will result and accrue to them personally if their rights are infringed or denied under the Patriot Act as Extended and/or the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, as detainment under either Act of Congress would result in incalculable mental, physical, and material suffering demonstrated in loss of health, loss of mental and emotional stability and well-being, loss of income, loss of employment,  loss of other properties, such as their homes, and every other specific benefit of freedom.    Petitioners have therefore demonstrated that both inherent rights and contractual rights stand subject to harm by these Acts of Congress, and the only requirements needed to establish standing have been met.  
As the United States District Court has properly and always maintained, in matters alleging and disputing infringement of rights and immunities guaranteed to _______________ Inhabitants under the public contract known as ”The Constitution of the United States of America”, the only jurisdiction having the authority and obligation to act in favor of __________ Inhabitants, including the Petitioners, is that of the Supreme Court of ________. Specifically, only the _____________ Supreme Court has the power to issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus to protect the Inhabitants of _______________ from the threat of an unlawful Bill of Detainer resulting from either of two Acts of Congress.
We have demonstrated standing before the only court having jurisdiction and we assert our right to Due Process including the right to file the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus presented herein.
Since 1789, the “(U)nited States of America” has existed by the right to contract, beginning with the inherent right of the Inhabitants to contract to create and inhabit those legal fictions known as “States”, and from thence, enabling the States to contract to form, limit, and create the “United States of America” dba  “US Corporation” and “Federal government” in itself another legal fiction deriving its existence and Authority to Act solely from the subrogated right of the Inhabitants to contract.
The Rights and Authorities of the Petitioners have been subrogated, but not annihilated nor extinguished. In the absence of performance under contract by the State of ____________, Inc., or the US Corporation, Petitioners are fully enabled to recall and assert their subrogated rights.
Since 1933, both Federal and State levels of the American government  have been incorporated, and the former public compact known as “The Constitution for the united States of America” has been translated to the public contract known as  “The Constitution of the United States of America”;  since 1938,  per US Supreme Court decision in Erie Railroad v. Thompkins, all public commerce has existed only by contract, such that the only recourse to Due Process is by the exercise of contracts between both living and corporate persons. 
Thus when living Inhabitants of a State seek protection of rights and immunities guaranteed under The Constitution of the United States we are disputing public contracts held under association by subrogation.  The Officers of the State of ________ owe the Petitioners, the Inhabitants of _________, the first duty to perform under contract, as the States asserted the Petitioners’ delegated Authority as parties to the contract under dispute.   While the Inhabitants retain their rights and all Authority under subrogation and do not currently hold the contract(s) creating these legal fictions fulfilled, the State of ______________, Inc., and its Officers must be given both Notice and Opportunity to fulfill their obligations.
This Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus presented to the _________ Supreme Court, Inc., gives the _____________ Supreme Court, Inc., and the Individual State Offices held by the Justices of the _______________ Supreme Court, Inc., opportunity to protect the interests of the Petitioners. Absent such opportunity to protect, assert, and enforce the contractually guaranteed rights and property interests of the Inhabitants of ______________, the State of _______________, Inc, is unable to fulfill its own contractual and fiduciary obligations.
If these public contracts are breached, all subrogated rights revert to the Inhabitants; all Authorities granted first to the State of __________________, Inc., and secondarily to the US Corporation also revert to the Inhabitants. Both of these public contracts, The Constitution of the State of _______________ and The Constitution of the United States of America can be voided by Dereliction of Duty and Willful Failure to Perform, such that the State of _____________, Inc., and the US Corporation, may lose granted Authority to Act if prompt and appropriate action is not taken to protect the property interests of the Petitioners.  
Thus the Petitioners’ right to be free from unlawful Bills of Detainer, and their receipt of a Writ of Habeas Corpus which preserves their most valuable property interest under contract in the face of infringing legislation, involves bedrock upon which the Petitioners, the State of _____________, Inc., and the US Corporation all depend, and it is equally in the interest of all parties to preserve.
The Petitioners who are Natural born citizens of other Foreign States, meaning States having Statehood prior to 1933 or prior to 1861, and/or States asserting restored de jure status, and also those Petitioners who legally assumed “US citizenship” and claim “civil rights” under the 14th Amendment to The Constitution of the United States of America,  and more generally, all ________________ possessing “Non-Foreign” citizenship, are initially dependent on the State of ___________________, Inc., and its Officers to perform under contract and act in their behalf. The Petitioners, Inhabitants of ____________________, assert their retained Rights and Authorities held under subrogation and demand performance under contract.  Failure to perform yields a contract in breach.
For governments as for individuals, failure to meet contractual obligations has consequences.
 The Justices of the _________________ Supreme Court are uniquely empowered to act in behalf of the State of _____________________, Inc., and the Inhabitants thereof when a conflict arises between the Inhabitants of the State and the US Corporation and its Officers over infringing legislation. The Officers of the ___________________ Supreme Court are the only ones empowered to grant immediate and effective relief to the Petitioners and other Inhabitants of ______________________ who are threatened by unlawful Bills of Detainer.
Such conflict has arisen.  The Officers of the US Corporation, including the Respondent members of Congress, have voted to ignore the provisions of the public contract under which the US Corporation operates and from which it proposes to derive its sole Authority to Act, The Constitution of the United States of America, by passing and enacting repugnant Acts of legislation, including the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012.    
The State of _______________________, Inc., and its Officers have thus far failed to respond to these infringements and presumptions, such that the contracts governing our State and our Nation are left unenforced to such an degree that the Inhabitants of _____________________, including the Petitioners, are recklessly endangered, with life and property at risk, and none of the Petitioners’ own granted Authority has been extended to protect them and their property interests.
The Petitioners have served Notice of Dereliction of Duty and Demand to Show Cause on Governor _________________, Lieutenant Governor __________________, and ____________Attorney General ______________________, and have similarly served Notice on US Senator ____________________ and US ________________________ and US Congressman ________________________.  Copies of both Federal and State Notices of Dereliction of Duty are attached.
Petitioners assert that “a law “beyond the power of Congress,” for any reason, is “no law at all.” Nigro v. United States, 276 U. S. 332, 341 (1928), and yet, any attempt to enact unlawful laws must be rebutted, or they will stand by presumption.  Lack of rebuttal by the State of ____________, Inc. and its Officers combined with gross presumption on the part of the US Corporation and its Officers, have led to the endangerment of the Petitioners, such that the Petitioners hold both public contracts, The Constitution of the State of ________________ and The Constitution of the United States of America, unfulfilled and potentially voided. 
Petitioners have served a proper Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus on the _______ Supreme Court, Inc.
A Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus has no existence outside of appeals from other actions, in this case, infringing legislation, and so is an “appellate matter” by definition.  A Writ of Habeas Corpus is the proper opposition to a Bill of Detainer, and may be issued in response to any situation in which a person is detained or under warrant for detainment or being held subject to detainment or threatened with detainment.  It does not have to arise from any pre-existing court case, nor does it require that the person(s) requesting protection actually be incarcerated. In this case the Petitioners are under threat of unlawful detainment as the result of contractual infringements already approved by the Officers of the US Corporation and clearly stated as Section 1021 and 1022 of the National Defense Authorization Act (2012) and are also being held subject to denial of their citizenship rights and similar detainment under the Patriot Act.    
 “Let it be known to all men and women of these United States that ";Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any state or territory, subjects or causes to be subject, any citizen of these United States or other person to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."; (Civil Rights) 42 U.S.C. 1963.
 
“Let us, We the People be perfectly clear in our position on this issue. We the People rely on the ruling from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals which has held that public officials/agents of the government do not have immunity simply because they operate in a discretionary manner. It indicated that public servants are to be held liable when they abused their discretion or acted in a way that was arbitrary, fanciful, or clearly unreasonable. (Civil law) Littleton v. Berbler, 468, F. 2d, 389 (1972).
";Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244 (1901) quote Justice Marshall Harlan in dissent:  ";…two national governments, one to be maintained under the Constitution, with all its restrictions, the other to be maintained by Congress outside and independently of that instrument, by exercising such powers as other nations of the earth are accustomed to…a radical and mischievous change in our system of government will result…We will, in that event, pass from the era of constitutional liberty guarded and protected by a written constitution into an era of legislative absolutism…It will be an evil day for American liberty if the theory of a government outside the supreme law of the land finds lodgment in our constitutional jurisprudence.";  
We have indeed come to that day, wherein presumption has allowed the US Corporation to assert dominion far apart from the contractual limits and obligations that are owed to all Natural born Citizens and has served to allow them also to propose to arbitrarily alter the civil rights owed “US citizens” who are Inhabitants of the State of ____________________. The absence of due diligence on the part of the State of __________________, Inc. evident in the absence of objection to these presumptions, and the failure to assert the contractual rights of the Inhabitants and the failure to defend the property interests of the Inhabitants of ___________________, as is due under contract from the Officers of the State of ______________________, Inc., has resulted in the threat and harm to the Inhabitants that is at the very heart the subject of the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus being presented. 
Better men than we would scoff and observe that we are asking help to guard the chickens from the foxes, and to the extent that the Officers of the State of __________________, Inc., have thus far uniformly failed to assert the rights of the Inhabitants and failed to protect the property interests and immunities of the Inhabitants of ___________________ from the endless contractual infringements imposed and proposed by the US Corporation and its Officers, they would be right.  Nonetheless, the foxes are under contract to guard the chickens and being paid to do so, which obligates them under contract.  The Petitioners must offer Notice and Opportunity to perform under contract to the Officers of the State of ________________, Inc., and must demonstrate that we have acted in a timely and responsible manner to assert our subrogated Rights, to demand performance under contract from the Officers of the State of ___________________________, Inc., and in the case of the Officers of the ____________________ Supreme Court, Inc., to provide them with opportunity to act in our favor.  
In conclusion in favor of this filing, a Writ of Habeas Corpus belongs only to the jurisdiction of the Appellate Courts, and in this case, the ________________Supreme Court is the only appellate court having both the jurisdiction and the obligation to provide the protection of a Writ of Habeas Corpus to the Inhabitants of _____________when they are under threat from unlawful Bills of Detainer. The Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus is being offered as opportunity to act in favor of the Petitioners. 
It is undoubtedly within the discretion of the _________________ Supreme Court, Inc., to refuse to act upon the Petitions it receives, and the Court may also choose to strike at its own basis for claiming Authority to Act, but as the ________________ Supreme Court holds the only proper jurisdiction, it is right and proper that the  Petitioners claim their right to file their Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus. 
Petitioners have established standing, have properly identified the court having jurisdiction to grant the relief they seek, and they assert their right to file their Petition under Due Process
 
 
 
IV. GROUNDS FOR RELIEF
 
1.  Ground One: Provisions in the Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act 2012 are in clear violation of rights and immunities that are contractually guaranteed to the States and by subrogation to the Petitioners by The Constitution of the United States of America. 
 
While it is true that the use of this Writ is not common practice, neither is the threat to which Petitioners are exposed.  It is entirely uncommon that the Inhabitants of _________________ en masse would be threatened with a Bill of Detainer absent recourse to Due Process, as such action is contractually forbidden to the US Corporation and its Officers by the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th Amendments of The Constitution of the United States of America;  nonetheless, the Officers of the US Corporation have presumed thus far to act in violation of their public contract and its limitations and have willfully subjected the Inhabitants of Alaska to Bills of Detainer under both the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, Sections 1021 and 1022.
 
They have also presumed to deny the right to contract to __________________ by revoking or otherwise denying the valid citizenship of Inhabitants of ____________________ under offending provisions of the Patriot Act.
 
The Right to Contract and the Right to Due Process of Law are vital property interests belonging to the Petitioners and guaranteed to the Petitioners by The Constitution of the United States of America, yet the Respondents, Officers of the US Corporation, presume to ignore, deny, and abridge these rights via legislation.
 
Not only are these rights specifically and explicitly guaranteed to the States and by subrogation also to the Petitioners, but their abridgement and the Authority to abridge them, is just as specifically and explicitly denied to the Officers of the US Corporation. 
 
The Respondents have ignored the plainly stated provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America and instead baldly offered to overturn the protections which are guaranteed to the Petitioners, and which are due and owed to them under public contract.
 
The Respondents also abundantly fail to recognize that their own Authority to Act fully depends on the existence and free exercise of the Petitioners’ Right to Contract and upon the Due Process of Law, without which no granted Authority can exist.  
 
There is a reason why The Constitution of the United States of America so carefully and repeatedly asserts and guarantees these rights of the Petitioners, and also why it repeatedly and carefully denies authority to Congress to meddle with these rights: the powers of the government and all granted Authority to Act derive from these inherent rights of the Petitioners. 
 
Undermining these rights of the Petitioners unavoidably undermines the government established by the Petitioners via the exercise of precisely these same rights.  Denying the Authority of the Petitioners denies the Authority of their representatives. 
 
By passing the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012), the Respondents are cutting off the legs of the stool on which they sit, assaulting the bedrock of American government and the basis of their own purported authority as well. 
 
Both in just defense of the contractually guaranteed property interests of the Petitioners, and in just defense of their established government, protection from unlawful legislative error (a Writ of Habeas Corpus) must be provided and other prompt corrective action must be taken by the State of ____________________________, Inc., and its Officers to enforce the provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America in favor of the Petitioners. 
 
 
2. Ground Two: Petitioners and other Inhabitants of ____________________ have already been harmed and infringed upon by the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012). 
 
The Petitioners are already being intimidated and confined under color of law and restrained in the exercise of their contractually guaranteed rights, including their right to Due Process of Law.  Petitioners have been intimidated to the extent that they appear under pseudonyms.  They fear that they will be arrested under the Patriot Act or NDAA (2012), and defamed as “terrorists” because they oppose the incipient police state. The risk of indefinite detainment deters them from speaking up in public under their real names.  
 
The Petitioners understand that equality under and before the law is paramount, and as such, they claim the right to use the protection of the requested Writ of Habeas Corpus under equal protection, to be interpreted and used as Writs of Habeas Corpus are used in both Pennsylvania and New York States, in all cases where an individual is confined or restrained in their liberty under any color of law or pretense whatsoever.
 
While the Petitioners are not at present in physical confinement in a prison, the restraint of freedom presented by the Bills of (Indefinite) Detainer in the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) makes it impossible to file this Writ and seek relief if once actually confined.  Thus we must address the Catch-22 nature of this infringement and seek injunctive relief prior to its application.  If we wait for any specific conflict to arise and entertain the enforcement of the Patriot Act or the NDAA of 2012, no means of recourse will be possible.  
 
These realities compel the Petitioners to seek the protection of a Writ of Habeas Corpus now.
 
 
3. Ground Three: Petitioners and other Inhabitants of _______________ are at clear and present risk.
 
The very existence and nature of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 and the Patriot Act have forced this action in lawful defense of personal liberty and protection of the Petitioners’ lives and property
 
The urgent potential for these Acts being used to deprive Petitioners of natural or legally assumed citizenship and to unlawfully and indefinitely detain them without recourse to Due Process, and to otherwise subject them to cruel, unusual, punishments, makes it imperative for us to file this Petition and for the ________________________ Supreme Court to act upon it.
 
The harm these Acts presume to do to ___________________ Inhabitants is extreme, arbitrary, and not allowed under the provisions of our public contracts.  Such consequences as being stripped of one’s citizenship, subjected to indefinite detainment without recourse to Due Process of Law merely on the basis of suspicion, and torture under interrogation, are terrible known and ongoing punishments that these Acts arbitrarily presume to enact against __________________.
 
The Petitioners, Inhabitants of _________________, are under dire threat, and the State of _________________________, Inc., and the US Corporation are under demand to perform under contract.  The issuance of a protective Writ of Habeas Corpus by the _____________ Supreme Court would be evidence in favor of the State of _________________’s willingness to meet its contractual and fiduciary responsibility owed Petitioners.
 
4. Ground Four: “The Acts” known as the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act of (2012) presume and depend upon Authority that was never granted.
 
Under different guises and via different trains of reasoning the US Corporation and its Officers have asserted the authority to indefinitely detain the Petitioners, Inhabitants of ___________, to strip them of their citizenship under the Patriot Act and indefinitely detain them without Due Process of Law. Such authority was never granted to the US Corporation or its Officers by any public contract the Petitioners are subject to. 
 
Any claim to the contrary stands staunchly denied by the Petitioners, who have never knowingly, willingly, and under conditions of full disclosure claimed “US citizenship” or otherwise compromised or renounced their Natural born Foreign State citizenship status.  Any claim that the Petitioners are by any means or overriding contract  not owed due diligence, good faith, and full performance under contract to The Constitution of the United States of America deserves neither credit nor toleration, and must be subjected to public record, examination, and rebuttal.
 
The National Defense Authorization Act (2012) likewise presumes powers and Authority never granted the US Corporation or its Officers, in clear violation of the provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America.
 
The Respondents do not have the granted Authority to detain the Petitioners or other ____________________ Inhabitants indefinitely without recourse to Due Process, nor do they have the Authority to deny the citizenship of the Petitioners nor the underlying right of the Petitioners to Contract.   Absent Authority to Act, the Act itself is null and void.
 
Such claims by the US Corporation and its Officers are entirely unsupported by any contractual agreement or provision in The Constitution of the United States of America and would serve to violently and without recourse deny  the Petitioners’ natural fundamental  and contractually guaranteed Right to Contract and Right to receive Due Process of Law.  
 
These Acts, the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012), are on their very face so repugnant to the spirit of Justice that although given the form and name of “law” they cannot be law, nor even a contractually conforming statute. 
 
These Acts of Congress approved by the named Respondent Officers of the US Corporation, serve to step by step defraud by presumption the Petitioners, the Inhabitants of ______________, of their contractually and necessarily guaranteed rights, and they further attempt to claim new and unheard of authorities that do not exist under the “The Constitution of the United States of America” and which are repugnant to it and which conspire against it. 
 
This conspiring against the limitations of their contract on the part of the Respondents and other Officers of the US Corporation is unavoidably apparent in these, their public Acts. The unjustifiable presumptions inherent to these Acts must stand fully rebutted and opposed by the State of ____________________, Inc, and its Officers if they wish to meet their fiduciary responsibility owed to the Petitioners, and to maintain their own contract and claim of granted Authority to Act.
 
The nature and manifest purpose of these Acts of Congress is to deprive Petitioners first of their citizenship protections and then to systematically deny them access to the courts, to destroy the presumption of innocence, and to remove all other aspects, rules, remedies, and relief currently available under Due Process of Law, all the while subjecting them to unlawful detainment and exacting both cruel and unusual punishments on those merely accused of being “terrorists”.   
 
These Acts of Congress intolerably violated the existing contract between the 50 States and by subrogation with the Petitioners on the day these Acts were passed.
 
These unwarranted and unjustifiable presumptions of Authority on the part of the US Corporation and its Officers have resulted in duress and intimidation under color of law to such an extent that they constrain the freedom of the Petitioners to walk down the street secure in the protections of their Natural born or legally assumed citizenship. These severe infringements have been enacted against them without granted Authority and have deprived them of the security of knowing that any of their rights will be respected and stand above arbitrary violation by the Officers of the US Corporation, including their right to Life.
 
The Officers of the US Corporation, the named Respondents and Others, have merely presumed granted Authority to which they have no reasonable or material claim, which has resulted in direct harm and threat to the Petitioners and others relying on the respect of contractual obligations that are public and fully in evidence.  
 
Not content with merely trying to wheedle extra or additional Authority by presumption, the Respondents and other Officers of the US Corporation have attempted to claim contractually forbidden Authority to Act for themselves, in that they have conspired against the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th Amendments of the Constitution of the United States of America and have sought to undermine the limits of The Constitution of the United States of America and have acted against the contractually guaranteed rights and immunities of the State of _______________, Inc., and by subrogation, the rights and immunities of the Petitioners and other Inhabitants of _________. 
 
The right to life itself stands infringed, so long as liberty is threatened and Due Process denied by any Act(s) of Congress, whether such Acts openly assert authority to destroy Due Process of Law in a single Act, or conspire to do so under cover of several Acts working together to accomplish the same end result. 
 
The State of __________________, Inc., and its Officers have thus far failed to protect the property interests of the Petitioners and have not offered to rebut these repugnant presumptions of the US Corporation and its Officers in the Petitioners’ behalf, even though the State of ___________, Inc., owes full fiduciary responsibility as party to The Constitution of the United State of America under the Petitioner’s subrogated Authority.
 
This has further compelled the Petitioners to fear for their property and their safety and to invoke their subrogated rights and demand performance under contract from the State of _________, Inc., and to offer this Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in lawful defense of their own property interests under contract.  Petitioners pray that the _______________ Supreme Court will act in their favor and provide the protection of the Writ.
 
5.  Ground Five.  The Officers of the US Corporation have acted outside the confines and provisions of their public contract with the 50 States and under subrogation with the Inhabitants of ____________, so as to radically endanger the property rights of the Petitioners and render the existence of a reliable public contract with the US Corporation in doubt. 
 
Since 1933 Petitioners and other Americans have contracted for services with each of the 50 States, and by extending their Authority to the 50 States, have contracted with the US Corporation to provide services stipulated by “The Constitution of the United States of America”, and since 1938 (US Supreme Court case Erie Railroad v. Thompkins) all entities legal and natural have functioned only by contract in public commerce.  There is no recourse to assert any de jure status for any of the 50 States between 1933 and 2009.
 
 There is, as a result, no doubt whatsoever that the public contracts established between the Inhabitants and the 50 States and between the 50 States and the US Corporation are fully operational commercial contracts, meant to be legally binding and enforced. 
 
A great deal of “Mission Creep” has been allowed the US Corporation and its Officers by the indulgent Officers of the 50 States over the past 78 years, which has resulted in the enactment of vast quantities of legislation outside the strict confines of the only actual contractual agreement between the 50 States and the US Corporation, The Constitution of the United States of America. 
 
The US Corporation and its Officers have been allowed (by the Officers of the 50 States who are primarily responsible for enforcement) to simply presume the Authority to pass legislation very far afield from the confines and provisions of The Constitution.  This lax unto non-existent enforcement of The Constitution of the United State of America by the Officers of the 50 States has led to this vital contract being disregarded, bypassed, and except for a lip-service ritual or two now and then, largely ignored. 
 
The Officers of the US Corporation have been allowed to “rule by presumption” by the Officers of the 50 States, who have sat mum about enforcement issues in exchange for political favors and pork barrel rewards.  It is not, therefore, at all surprising that the members of Congress have now presumed against the Petitioners’ most basic rights, and equally not surprising that the Officers of the State of ______________________ are standing around shuffling their feet and considering all their usual priorities and political axes to grind, instead of taking prompt action to rebut the presumptions inherent in the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012)
 
They imagine that this is “business as usual” when it’s not. 
 
The State of _______________, Inc. is responsible for enforcing the contract provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America and owes a fiduciary responsibility under contract to the Inhabitants of _________________ to do so.  The manifest failure (thus far) of the Officers of the State of ___________________ to perform this duty of enforcement in favor of the Petitioners and to perform it responsibly and promptly, has now caused the Petitioners to invoke their Rights and Authorities under subrogation, and caused them to demand performance under contract from the State of ________________________, Inc.
 
The Executive Officers of the State of ____________________________ have been duly given Notice of Dereliction of Duty and the Judicial Officers are being given the opportunity to issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus in protection of the Petitioners’ property interests.  Continued inaction and endangerment of the Petitioners will lead to Notice of Willful Failure to Perform, followed by Notice of Breach of Contract, followed by Notice of Full Estoppel and Denial of Authority to Act. 
 
There is no doubt that the Inhabitants of _________________________ have been and are being recklessly endangered and subjected to duress and expense as a direct result of the continuing lapse of the Officers of the State of ________________________ to require enforcement of The Constitution of the United States of America in favor of the Petitioners.  There is no doubt that the State of _______________________, Inc., is obligated to enforce each and every commercial contract it enters into in behalf of the Petitioners under their granted Authority and that the State of ______________________, Inc.,  owes absolute fiduciary responsibility to the Petitioners to do so.
 
This Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus is just a small part of the remedy being sought by the Petitioners.  It happens to be the portion lying directly in the jurisdiction of the _________________ Supreme Court.
 
As there has been no public process of Amendment granting the Officers of the US Corporation any new Authority, the ___________________ Supreme Court must in the absence of other evidence duly tested, submitted for rebuttal,  and presented in public record, accept that the public contract known as “The Constitution of the United States of America” remains in effect and that the US Corporation and all Officers of the US Corporation are bound by this contract to abide in Good Faith and Full Service to its provisions.
 
Also, in the absence of other evidence duly tested, submitted for rebuttal, and entered into public record, the _____________________ Supreme Court, Inc., must accept that there is no new or valid “emergency” means to amend or override the provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America, such that the contract is what it is, and while it may be subject to interpretation by the US Supreme Court, is not subject to revision by Acts of Congress. 
 
Further, in the absence of other evidence duly vetted and entered as evidence in response to this Petition, the _____________________ Supreme Court must accept that any public or private act conspiring to overthrow the limits and deny the protections of The Constitution of the United States of America or conspiring to use a process of presumption to arbitrarily amend the provisions of this contract so as to defraud the Petitioners of their rights, which are property interests necessary to maintain the existence of our government, are by definition Acts of Treason.
 
This long slow slide into police state tyranny by a process of acquiescence, presumption, and fraud, has come to an end.  We now face issues of Life and Death.  The Petitioners invoke their Rights and Authority under subrogation and move the Officers of the State of _____________, Inc., to perform under contract to procure enforcement of The Constitution of the United States of America and to protect the most vital property interests of the Petitioners—their liberty and their lives---- by issuing a Writ of Habeas Corpus. 
 
6. Gound Six.  These Acts of Congress, the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012) presume to impose cruel and unusual punishments on the Petitioners and other Inhabitants of ________________, and are also Void for Vagueness. 
 
Insomuch as these Acts propose cruel and unusual punishment for undefined acts described as “terrorism”, the punishments authorized under the Patriot Act (denial of citizenship and Right to Contract followed by indefinite detainment) and under the National Defense Authorization of 2012, (indefinite detention without Due Process of Law) are in no sense “usual” and in their presentation and their effect, are cruel and unusual, such that Inhabitants of Alaska could, via the presumptions inherent in either Act, receive an “administrative sentence” of Life Imprisonment merely on the basis of “suspicion” of “terrorism”. 
 
It is abhorrent that we should see, hear, or smell any such Acts proposed by Members of Congress. The Respondents have themselves presented the greatest threat to America, and to _____________________________, by proposing these Acts and by disrespecting their contractual obligations and by presuming Authority that was never granted to them. They have served unlawful ends, seeking to overthrow the very basis of our just government.
 
It is a standing requirement of all Law and valid statutes that they must be constructed in a way that is not confusing or obscure in meaning, so as to leave average people without the means to understand and apply the law or statute they are meant to obey.  The repeated and apparently purposeful and unusual refusal of the Members of Congress, the Officers of the US Corporation, including the Respondents, to fully and exactly and legally define “terrorism”  and “any person” and “belligerent acts” and other terms in these Acts which are purportedly devoted to the subject of “terrorism” is prima facie evidence that Congress intended to leave the nature of the crime undefined so as to promote lax and uncertain standards and to allow almost any interpretation of what “terrorism” might mean and what acts might be construed as “acts of terrorism”.
 
Indeed, the Acts that are the main subject of this Petition leave the meaning of “terrorism” so abundantly vague as to render the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) Void for Vagueness, even if no other objection could be found.  Like the Income Tax statutes that fail to define “income”, these Acts of Congress refuse to define the very subject and substance of the acts being considered---- “terrorism”----in any practical way that would serve members of the public and our law enforcement officers as an operational definition. 
 
Petitioners possess and insist upon the contractually guaranteed right to be free of duress and free of the threat of the cruel and unusual punishment presented by Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act, and insist that in the absence of clear and appropriate legal definition of “terrorism” these Acts of Congress are Void for Vagueness, such that average members of the Public and of the law enforcement community would be unable to reliably discern the difference between an “act of terrorism” and an “act of arson” for example, or to reliably and fairly apply the statutes resulting from these Acts in a uniform and constructive way.
 
These Acts present two powerful unlawful Bills of Detainer.  They threaten the Petitioners with administratively enforced Life Imprisonment, but they neglect to define the crime.  Perhaps no other circumstance so clearly illustrates the police state intimidation being practiced against the Inhabitants of ______________________, including the Petitioners, or more loudly calls upon the Alaska Supreme Court to extend the protection of a Writ of Habeas Corpus. 
 
7. Ground Seven.  Arbitrarily depriving Petitioners of their citizenship (Patriot Act) and thereby denying their Right to Contract is logically fatal to any claim of granted Authority being possessed by either the State of __________________ or the US corporate government.  
 
The Petitioners’ Right to Contract is the basis for the existence of the United States of America, the US Corp, and also the State of ________________.  The Officers of the US Corp are thus striking at the very basis of the same Authority they claim to invoke when they attack or abridge the Petitioners’ Right to Contract. On one hand, they are pretending to be the recipients of granted Authority derived from the States and their Inhabitants by contract, and on the other hand, then attempting to deny that these very same Inhabitants have the Right to Contract at all, such that the contract formed by their Natural-born or legally assumed citizenship may be nullified by fiat by the same US Corporation----a legal fiction that would not exist apart from the Inhabitant’s Right to Contract.
 
Petitioners assert that the rights and authorities of any lawful American government derive always and only from those governed, and that the natural right of the Inhabitants to contract is the only basis for the existence of legal fictions such as the State of ________________, the United States of America, and the US Corporation.
 
As water flows downhill, the delegation of Authority proceeds from the Inhabitants by valid public contract to the States and from the States by valid public contract to the United States of America, not the other way around. Any presumption that these legal fictions may infringe on the natural rights of the Inhabitants, and especially and particularly the natural right of the Inhabitants to contract, is suicidal on the face of it for all levels of government in America and completely destructive to their claim to possess any granted Authority to Act whatsoever.
 
The American form of government requires the protection of the Petitioners’ right to contract and asserts the Petitioners’ ultimate Authority, because without those two elements, the government itself is reduced to the status of a legal fiction with no granted Authority to Act.
 
That the Officers of the US Corporation no longer recognize the source of their own Authority to Act, as demonstrated and conclusively proven by the offending provisions of the Patriot Act,  is truly alarming. Either by ignorance or by guile, the presence of legislation that denies the rights and inherent Authority of the Petitioners signals a violent departure from the American form of government, and suggests that the Officers of the US Corporation may be attempting to assume dictatorial power over the people they are supposed to represent.
 
The Petitioners see the Patriot Act’s attack on the right of the Inhabitants to contract, which is the only valid source of Authority for our government, as more evidence that both the Petitioners and the legitimate government are at risk, further underlining the need for the protection of a Writ of Habeas Corpus.  A conscious effort to undermine the basis of Authority for our government implies that the Petitioners, especially the Named Petitioner, are at mortal risk for offering opposition. A Writ of Habeas Corpus protecting those who seek to preserve the traditional American government is sorely needed and duly sought.
 
8. Ground Eight.  There is no evidence of a valid “War on Terror” and no evidence that “terrorists” can or should be distinguished from common criminals.  
 
It is now and it has always been apparent that “terror” is a tactic of guerrilla warfare used by virtually every nation on earth, including the United States of America.  Terrorism has clearly not been outlawed by the US Corporation. Terrorism as a tactic has long been a prima facie part of public policy. As one example, the US Corporation has freely chosen to load artillery shells with “depleted” nuclear waste from nuclear power plants and has been happily exploding them throughout the Mideast in any country deemed to be an “enemy combatant” for over a decade.
 
Petitioners can think of nothing more terrifying than the prospect of having the soil and water of an entire nation polluted with nuclear waste, nor can they think of any greater threat than slow death and genetic destruction of an entire civilian population carried out over the course of the next 6,000 years. 
 
Terrorism is clearly not something the US Corporation is fighting against nor even refraining from.  Petitioners assume that any real “War on Terror” necessarily involves not practicing terrorism.
 
Throughout all the excuses proposed to justify the gross infringements against liberty that the Patriot Act and the NDAA of 2012 represent, there has been a very strained attempt to define “terrorism” as an act of war, instead of a crime.
 
If “terrorism” is an “act of war” then those detained under the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) are covered by the Geneva Convention, and owed all the provisions agreed upon. 
 
If “terrorism” is a crime carried out by individuals, we already have other names for it---murder, arson, vandalism----and an endlessly complex criminal justice system ready to deal with it.
 
The facts do not support any claim of emergency or “wartime” powers needed to deal with terrorists or terrorism.  The Petitioners, Inhabitants of ____________, are subjected to dire threat by the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, such that their lives and their property stand at risk, but there is no credible justification for it.
 
The Respondents have allowed and promoted and nurtured and steadily advanced a police state to the point where the Petitioners are in very real danger---not from “terrorists” wearing turbans and brandishing swords 9,000 miles away----but from the Respondents and their public Acts.  
 
The Respondents have ignored the meaning and vital importance of the public contracts under which they are obligated to function and to which they owe constant and faithful allegiance, with the result that the Petitioners are living in the shadow and threat of indefinite detention without recourse to Due Process, and seeing their local police force transformed into the American KGB.  
 
These realities are well-known and can be extensively documented at the Court’s request. They fully justify the issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus to protect the Petitioners.  Petitioners offer the information offered at these two websites as a starter:  How the Feds Fueled the Militarization of Police  / <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fobrag.org%2F&amp;h=VAQFtBBig&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/obrag.org\/";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fobrag.org\u00252F&amp;h=VAQFtBBig&amp;s=1";);">obrag.org</a> and  How the War on Terror Has Militarized the Police  <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2F&amp;h=8AQE3h0T8&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.theatlantic.com\u00252F&amp;h=8AQE3h0T8&amp;s=1";);">www.theatlantic.com</a> 
 
9. Ground Nine.  The offending provisions of the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act (2012) undermine Public Trust on a global scale and suppress the American economy, creating further undeserved harm to the Petitioners reputation, property interests and commercial well-being. 
 
If the Petitioners, parties to The Constitution of the United States of America under subrogation, have their property rights attacked by the US Corporation, no other sentient being on the planet can feel confident in their business dealings with the US Corporation. 
 
If the US Corporation and its Officers refuse to honor the one obvious, simple, all-important contract, how can anyone trust them to honor any other contract?  When the Officers of the US Corporation fail to honor The Constitution of the United States of America and the States fail to enforce it, red flags go up from Greenland to Thailand, and rightly so.
 
By dishonoring The Constitution of the United States of the America at home, the US Corporation reaps commercial disaster abroad, as other nations flee from contracts that may similarly be dishonored.
 
All this again harms the Petitioners who depend to a greater or lesser extent on willing trading partners to preserve and maintain their business enterprises and quality of life.  A Writ of Habeas Corpus cannot provide direct relief against this result, but it can protect the Petitioners while they seek repeal of these dangerous and ill-considered Acts of legislation. 
 
Ground 10:  Since the enactment of the Patriot Act as Extended and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, has been moving through the Committee process in both Houses of Congress:  S. 1698 and HR. 3166, known as the Enemy Expatriation Act. The existence of this incipient Act of Congress is further proof of coordinated, conscious conspiracy against the guaranteed property interests of the Petitioners.  
The Enemy Expatriation Act seeks to codify the already administratively realized undermining of the Right to Contract embodied in the Patriot Act , and specifically attacks the Petitioners’ right to maintain citizenship  by natural or legally assumed contract, arbitrarily assuming the power to claim breach of that contract and void it whenever a person is suspected of “supporting hostilities” against the government. 
If the Respondents, Members of Congress, have arbitrary power to breach this contract, they have the arbitrary power to breach any contract, merely on their passage of convenient ex post facto legislation claiming such powers for themselves. 
By definition such powers must be claimed ex post facto, because no sane person of any kind would willingly enter into contract knowing that other parties to that contract would later assume the arbitrary power to void or change the terms and provisions of it. 
That the existence of any such power would be profoundly disruptive to any lawful government is self-evident, as it would subject all other parties and all other contracts to the whims of political will and would derogate the Right of Contract possessed by the Congress as much or more than it would harm the  Petitioner’s Right to Contract. 
The purpose of this legislation as stated by the sponsors and co-sponsors is:  “To add engaging in or supporting hostilities against the United States to the list of acts for which United States nationals would lose their nationality.”
This legislation is Void for Vagueness and potentially subject to abuse due to lack of strict construction and reliable definition of words and terms, very similar to the same problems noted with the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012) already addressed as Ground 6.   Just as the Patriot Act leaves “terrorism” undefined and NDAA (2012) leaves “belligerent acts” undefined, the Enemy Expatriation Act neglects to define what constitutes an act “engaging in or supporting hostilities against the United States”.   
Is a child name-calling in the street engaging in “hostilities against the United States”?    Are we engaging in the same when we submit this Petition?   The proposed legislation continues the repugnant effort to codify infringements against the Petitioners’ guaranteed property interests, and provides more proof by its content and existence that we are being subjected to a coordinated and purposeful infringement of our contractually guaranteed Rights and Immunities.
Both the offending passages of the NDAA (2012) and the offending passages of the pending Enemy Expatriation Act, seek to codify and make permanent the administrative emergency powers embodied in the Patriot Act that were never proper in the first place, but which they have sought to establish by a process of “emergency rules” and presumption against the Petitioners and other Inhabitants of __________________.
The Petitioners’ Right to Contract is the necessary bedrock underlying the American government at all levels. State and the Federal governments both depend on the Petitioners’ Right to Contract for their existence and it is also the basis for any claim that government possesses “granted Authority to Act”. 
The seriousness of this issue can hardly be overstated.  Since the Hooven and Allison Company v. Evatt Supreme Court decision in 1901, the federal government has relied in ever-increasing degree upon extending its jurisdiction and expanding its material claims against “US citizens”.  While the Petitioners do not in any way approve of this practice and do not find legal merit in the claims being made based upon it, the situation does neatly illustrate the interlocking relationship between the Right to Contract with respect to citizenship and the material well-being of the government. 
The Founders were acutely aware of this relationship between the Right to Contract as it applied to citizenship and the impact of this particular contract on the government.  The controlling Statute at Large defining the process of becoming a  “US citizen” was passed April 14, 1802, 2 Stat. 153, c. 28, ss 1, Rev. Stat. 2561. In this process, a State National, already possessing Citizenship within one of the 50 States, agrees to undertake the obligations of “US citizenship”. This mandates among other things, a two year period of formal Declaration of Intent, maintenance of a residency requirement, good character, a public oath of allegiance and equally public renunciation of any other allegiance, all recorded in a Court of Record.  Clearly, the contract between a citizen and a government is of the most serious nature possible, requiring voluntary, sober, and prolonged consideration and intent, public recording, and consciously recognized obligations of allegiance.
 
We can think of only one other contractual process requiring similar duration of intent, exhibition of good character, and determined public action, and that is the somewhat similar process of Naturalization, which additionally includes educational requirements. 
A government is only as good as its citizens. We know that the stability, health, intelligence, character, and strength of a nation is a direct reflection of its government, and government  is in turn a direct reflection of the those same qualities possessed  or lacked by those inhabiting that government.  Instead of the common political assumption that citizens represent a population to be served and swayed, citizens are in fact the substance of both the government and the nation. 
Citizens determine the existence and the character of the government, and by their allegiance they morally and materially sustain the government.  As a result, all lawful governments have an avid self-interest in securing the highest quality citizens possible, in promoting their education, in earning their loyalty, and in promoting their prosperity. 
This ideal of an enlightened and self-interested government which sees its own welfare best represented by an enlightened and self-interested citizenry is a uniquely American concept, one which we have codified in our laws governing citizenship requirements, and which works admirably well so long as the government continues to earn and deserve the allegiance of its citizens.
From this perspective, a government that fails to protect, advance, and earn the allegiance of its citizens has already failed as a government.  No verbal or legal action undertaken by any citizen in response can add to this failure which the government has created and allowed by its own acts. 
The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 were very similar to these present Acts of Congress.  They were comprised of four separate actions.
Naturalization -- Extended the duration of residence for aliens to become citizens from 5 to 14 years.
 Alien Act -- Authorized the President to apprehend and deport resident aliens considered ";dangerous to the peace and safety of the US.";
 The Alien Enemies Act -- Authorized the President to apprehend and deport resident aliens if their home countries were at war with the US.
Sedition Act -- Made it a crime to publish ";false, scandalous, and malicious writing"; against the government or certain public officials.
The 1953 McCarthy Era Sedition Act was arguably the most shameful piece of legislation in the history of our nation, allowing the long, bitter, ugly persecutions, trials, and public hearings that now make us cringe. 
Twice before in our history Congress has approved these forms of legislation and twice before they have been struck down.   How many more times must Americans go through this process before the message sinks in that it is not allowed?   Such legislation was wrong in 1798.  It was wrong in 1953.  It is still wrong now.   
There is still no Authority vested in Congress under any public contract that would serve to allow the Respondents to entertain such an usurpation against the Petitioners, and as we have demonstrated, plenty of precedent proving that there is not, and yet, by improper presumption, such Authority is asserted again by both the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) and is incipient in the Enemy Expatriation Act. 
Petitioners cite this latest offer of encroachment against their guaranteed rights, the Enemy Expatriation Act, as evidence in their favor and in support of their assertion that a Writ of Habeas Corpus is both appropriate and necessary as a safeguard for their liberty in a circumstance wherein they are threatened by a coordinated effort to undermine their most basic rights and freedoms. 
Ground 11:  These Acts of Congress are being pursued to codify and enroll “emergency” powers on a permanent basis, when no emergency exists and when no major attack of any kind has taken place for over a decade.  Petitioners assert that there is no valid reason why these supposedly “temporary emergency  provisions”  are being prolonged and codified long after any valid state of emergency can be said to exist, and so must assert that the Respondents, Members of Congress, are attempting to erode the basic property interests of the Petitioners by presumption and usurpation.
 It is highly questionable that such powers should have ever been allowed an American President, under any circumstance, emergency or otherwise.  America has seen far more disruptive and dangerous events than anything that happened in March of 1933 or on September 11, 2001, without allowing those possessing only delegated authority to derogate and disrespect the basic rights of Americans.
Petitioners assert that these infringements are dangerous and indicative of a developing police state that will, if allowed, present a clear and present danger to the Petitioners, Inhabitants of _______________, in excess of any threat that the members of the Taliban could have ever hoped to inflict.  The lack of any credible justification for prolonging much less codifying these “emergency” provisions after ten years without major incident and with peace talks underway with the Taliban, is more proof that these acts are merely attempts to make permanent encroachments against the rights and other property interests of the Petitioners. 
Similar “emergency” infringements against the basic rights of German citizens were undertaken by the National Socialist Party of Germany following the Reichstag Fire. It resulted in the purging of all counter-balancing elements in the government, the gross empowerment of a charismatic leader, suppression of all property interests and personal liberties, domestic genocide, and a headlong rush into devastating war.  
This is not the first time that a “state of emergency” has provided the necessary excuse for despotism.  This same tired trick has been used over and over again, even though it has been struck down repeatedly as a rationale for usurpation against The Constitution of the United States of America.
The Petitioners see the issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus as a first “emergency” step in response to the very real threat being offered by the Respondents. 
Ground 12: These Acts of Congress are in direct violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the United States supported and signed and is obligated to support.  
 These Acts of Congress, the Patriot Act, NDAA (2012), and the pending Enemy Expatriation Act, all serve to derogate the Human Rights of the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  The United States signed this UN Declaration in 1948 and is still obligated to honor its provisions. In tolerating and in enacting these offensive laws, the Respondents are acting in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in obvious disrespect of International Law.
Specifically quoting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: 
Article 8: Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law. 
Article 9: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.
Article 10: Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.
Article 11(1):  Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defense.  (Petitioners have argued in other Grounds that there is no rational basis for distinguishing between an act of terrorism and any other crime.)
Article 12:  No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.
Article 15(1): Everyone has the right to a nationality. (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality.
Article 17(2): No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.  (Petitioners reflect the judicial rendering of rights, immunities, and freedoms as property interests under contract.)
Article 30: Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein.
A fair reading of the language, intent, and consideration of the affects of the Patriot Act, National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, and the pending Enemy Expatriation Act, clearly shows the purposeful, blatant, and malicious intent to deny, derogate, and undermine one after another of these provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
As a tag team of interlocking and fully codified Acts designed to intimidate, suppress, oppress, and deny Human Rights to Americans, these three Acts of Congress are outstanding in their efficiency and broad in their reach.  Petitioners could only wish that the Respondents, Members of Congress, were half so talented and avid in defense of inherent rights, immunities, and freedoms as they are eager to oppress, intimidate, defraud, and betray the property interests of the people they are supposed to represent and the public contracts they are obligated to uphold.
In full view of the mutually supportive elements actually present in the three referenced Acts of Congress, there can be no doubt that they are the product of a purposeful, coordinated, intentional, and premeditated effort to codify infringements against rights that are not subject to derogation.  These Acts were created, compiled, and advanced for the specific purpose of undermining the Petitioners’ Right to Contract and Right to Due Process and together these Acts of Congress materially represent a prima facie conspiracy against The Constitution of the United States of America.
The offered destruction of the Petitioners’ Right to Contract and Right to Due Process as guaranteed to the Inhabitants is profound, and the existence and content of the third element of related legislation, the Enemy Expatriation Act, serves to prove that the presented Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus is an appropriate protection and action  toward restoring the legitimate contractual boundaries imposed on our government(s) by The Constitution of the United States of America and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Ground 13:  Respondents are lacking any basis of Authority to Act.  Petitioners initially cited the Respondents’ lack of granted Authority under Commercial Franchise and Admiralty Law in the absence of contract fulfillment owed to all Natural born Foreign State Inhabitants of __________________, aka “Americans” and then also due as equal Civil Rights to all US citizens.  Petitioners have since polled the Oath of Office for each one of the State of ____________officials granted Notice of Dereliction of Duty and Demand to Show Cause, and also the similarly Noticed Respondents, Officers of the US Corporation, Members of Congress, under process of Quo Warranto. 
As a result of the Petitioners’ examination, they assert that the Respondents have no Authority over Americans under Canon Law and never did and never could have, and that all their possible recourses to claim Authority for the offending portions of the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) are demonstrably exhausted. 
The Respondents’ Oaths cannot be taken under Canon Law if they claim to represent the 50 States United, and that is without exception.  Their deficiency under Commercial Franchise and Admiralty Law and their inability to claim granted Authority with respect to the offending portions of the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012) has been abundantly covered in other Grounds of this Petition.  They are similarly deficient with respect to The Declaration of Independence and the present Constitution of the United States of America under Canon Law, the third and last possible source of Authority that could conceivably be invoked by the Respondents.
America is clearly a Protestant State under Canon Law, openly declaring the “equality of all” and thus specifically denying the possibility of any Office of government requiring a Public Oath under submission to Divinity.
The chronic abuse of Authority in respect to the Petitioners, who are living entities, whose flesh lives and whose blood flows, who are sovereigns under Divine Law equal to any other,  granted equal Dominion by God, and who admit no barrier between themselves and the Divine, Natural born Inhabitants of the 50 States, by the Respondents, Officers of the US Corporation, Members of Congress, is reprehensible and deeply repugnant to their presumed and professed Office, which has often been grossly misrepresented through purposeful semantic obfuscations. 
Let us quote the Congressional Oath confirming submission to Divinity: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.”
Generations of Americans have assumed that the “Constitution of the United States” referenced in this Oath is the same as “The Constitution of the United States of America”.  They have also innocently taken the “So help me God” part of this Oath as a harmless and humble plea to Heaven for help in the discharge of the duties of Office.  Neither of these assumptions are true.
This is the only Congressional Public Oath.  It invokes Divinity, and it is not taken to The Constitution of the United States of America.  It is taken to the “Constitution of the United States”, indicating a different document.
The Respondents’ chronic abuse of the property interests of the Petitioners has finally resulted in direct threat to the Petitioners’ lives and liberty, whereupon the Petitioners have asked---Quo Warranto?
Not Divine Authority, for that would have to be invoked via the Respondents’ Public Oath of Office, and for that Office representing the interests of the 50 States United.  No such Oath can exist, because the 50 States United established a Protestant Republic that admits no such elements of “Rule by Divine Right” and instead declares the equality of all.  
Petitioners have much evidence to present, proving that the Respondents, Officers of the US Corporation, Members of Congress, have inherited a number of Offices, in relation to two or more groups of “states” and corporate bodies; specifically, the Respondents have de facto rule over the District of Columbia, Guam, and other Territories, which are also and separately called the “United State of America” as per the distinctions made in the Alaska Omnibus Act and as documented in Downes v. Bidwell, Hooven and Allison Company v. Evatt, and elsewhere. 
This creates a purposeful semantic obfuscation and confusion as to which “United States of America” is being referenced at any given time.
This second version of “United States of America” is distinct from the common understanding of the 50 United States of America, and also distinct from the “United States of America” defined as a “federal corporation” at Title 28, 3002, 15 (A) (B) (C). The Respondents commonly make use of this semantic mélange of “United States of America(s)” and all the related Offices to purposefully misrepresent the capacity in which they are acting at any given time, resulting in public confusion which has been turned to self-interested and fraudulent misrepresentations, omissions, and avoidances under contract, as in the present case.
The Oath of Office offered and widely assumed to be the Oath associated with the Respondents’ Public Office representing one of the 50 States United, is the only recorded and public Oath of Office that the Respondents have taken under Canon Law, and it is made in their capacity as de facto rulers of the “other” version of “United States” ----the District of Columbia, et alia.  That Oath and that Office are foreign to the 50 States United.
In the absence of a Public Oath submitted under Divinity there can be no recourse to Divine Law as the basis of any asserted Authority. The Respondents have no known Public Oath submitted under Divinity associated with their Public Office with respect to the 50 States United, nor, as proven by the Declaration of Independence can there be any such Oath of Office taken under principle of Divine Right. 
The Respondents do have recourse to Divine and Canon Law as rulers of the “United States of America” comprised of “the District of Columbia, Guam, et alia”.  This version of “United States of America” is a member of the British Commonwealth under a similarly obscured arrangement with Puerto Rico  They enjoy no such right and can advance no such claim in their capacity under contract to the 50 States United nor against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of ______________. 
As a result, the Respondents have no recourse to Canon Law as a source of Authority for Acts of Congress affecting any of the Inhabitants of the 50 States United, including the Petitioners, and no such Authority can be justified or claimed against them.
What is owed to Americans generally is also then specifically owed to “US citizens” under the provisions of the 14th Amendment and the advancement of equal “Civil Rights” and to all Non-Foreign citizens as Human Rights protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  No matter how the Respondents propose to interpret their authority under Canon Law with respect to US citizens, any unequal and deleterious impact must be contravened as disrespect of pre-existing contract. 
Thus, there is no granted Authority in any kind available to the Respondents to justify the presumptions made against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of __________________, by the Patriot Act and the offending portions of NDAA (2012).  The Enemy Expatriation Act, if passed, would be similarly lacking.  
In the absence of Honor, there is no Authority.  In the absence of both Honor and Authority, there is no Law. 
All three crowns are Dishonored by these Acts of Congress in the matter of Holy Contract, for those subscribed, and for those Inhabitants who are not “US citizens”, but Americans of a different Stamp, no jurisdiction at all can be claimed in the absence of contract fulfillment, thus rendering the offending provisions of both the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) void at Canon, void at Admiralty, void at Equity, and respectively, void without jurisdiction.  
No form of election can satisfy these reproofs; only Cause, Unction, or Treaty may be offered, in the absence of which, Petitioners maintain that issuance of a protective Writ of Habeas Corpus is the only sure means of preventing Miscarriage of Justice in Impietatis Templum Regis. 
Ground 14:  These public Acts of Congress are in violation of Federal Code, per Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 115, Section 2384:
“If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.”
Both these Acts of Congress, the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012)  were pursued entirely within the confines of Washington, DC, a locale that is unquestionably “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” defined as the states of the District of Columbia, Guam, et alia. 
Whereas (as Petitioners allege) judicial error first promoted in Downes v. Bidwell has freely allowed the Respondents, Members of Congress, importunate rule over the “United States” defined as the District of Columbia, et alia, their actions in passing both the Patriot Act and the offending parts of NDAA (2012) have endangered both forms of “Government of the United States” by their unlawful presumptions, as witnessed by the 14th Amendment and otherwise. 
Petitioners assert that two or more Respondents, Members of Congress, conspired to overthrow the basis of the lawful “Government of the United States” as defined by the Government of the 50 States United by attacking the Right to Contract, and that they also therefore effectively undermined the basis for the existence of the “Government of the United States” as defined as the Government of the District of Columbia, et alia, which equally depends upon the Right to Contract for its existence.  The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, include “US citizens” who are thereby equally offended by these Acts of Congress, though unable to directly impugn them.
The District of Columbia, for example, was created by agreement among the several States.  It can be dissolved by agreement among the States and returned to the natural properties and ownerships from which it was derived.  Similarly, none of the other “states” said to be in “union” with the District of Columbia are related to it by anything more or different than a contract. 
We have a situation in which the tail not only proposes to wag the dog, but proposes to run the whole dog under the bus.
In this instance, no matter how the Respondents propose to define “Government of the United States” or which “Government of the United States” they invoke, no such entity exists apart from the Right to Contract and in the case of the District of Columbia, et alia, the Right to Contract Under God, such that in any case, the Respondents actions against the Petitioners’ Right to Contract amount to Seditious Conspiracy against both of the defined “Government(s) of the United States”. 
Petitioners insist that they are living entities, the flesh lives and the blood flows, and that those of us so claiming are sovereign, admitting no barrier between ourselves and the Divine, granted EQUAL dominion under God, such that our Right to Contract is our immutable and necessary property interest, without which no “government” can be established or upheld under Canon Law, Admiralty Law, or Law of Equity. 
Despite all ingenious legal arguments in favor of the Pope’s Divinity, it can be readily proven that the Pope is a mortal Homo sapien, and that whatever claim of Divine Authority can be exercised by him or any government under Vatican Authority,  it is in point of fact established by the Right to Contract.  Nobody is naturally a part of the Church of Rome or under the Kingship of any of the associated nations absent willing, knowing, and fully disclosed subscription, and the Pope is himself claiming to have a contract with God, as God’s representative and steward on Earth. 
Thus, no matter what the Respondents may claim otherwise, the existence of their other version of the “United States of America” equally depends on the Right to Contract, both in the Vatican’s purported contract with God, and the contract of those subscribing to the Church’s Authority, or as subsidiaries, as “subjects” of the King of England in the Commonwealth. 
Absent the freely exercised Right to Contract no valid “Government of the United States” can be said to exist in any form.  All of the entities invoked devolve and become uninhabitable legal fictions absent the Right to Contract, even if that Right is ultimately self-limited to the Right to Contract with the Holy See. 
Those Petitioners, Inhabitants of __________________, who are in fact “US citizens” at present have no recourse of their own, owing to the self-serving error of the US Supreme Court in Hooven and Allison Company v. Evatt allowing Congress to rule over “US citizens” and the Buck Act’s further outrages allowing Congress to openly treat all “US citizens” as “property” of the “District of Columbia….et alia.”  They are, however, owed “equal civil rights” from the Respondents and their government, with the result that the entity calling itself the “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia et alia is caught in its own Catch-22 dilemma.
The Respondents cannot claim the existence of “US citizens” or any source of Authority over any “US citizens” absent the Right to Contract, and they cannot attack the Right to Contract of the Petitioners who are Natural-born “Foreign” State Citizens without then similarly undermining the Right to Contract said to be possessed by their own “US citizens” under the 14th Amendment of The Constitution of the United States of America which is itself a contract, or by any properly Witnessed and disclosed consensual contract otherwise.
Protection of the rights, which are property interests, of all manner of citizen existing as Inhabitants of the State of __________________ must be the first valid concern of the State of Alaska, Inc., and its Officers.  Preservation of life and liberty in the face of infringement of Natural Rights, Civil Rights (14th Amendment), and Human Rights (Universal Declaration) must be provided, and so it is that the Petitioners, Inhabitants of ______________, have straight away sought the protection of Writ of Habeas Corpus, without which protection no other right can be guaranteed or, in the case of incarceration, asserted. 
Ground 15:  The Constitution of the United States of America has been violated repeatedly, breached by the Respondents and their Kin, and left Derelict for lack of enforcement by the Officers of the State of __________________, Inc., such that it is in Process of being Voided for Willful Failure to Perform, yet it remains at this time the declared Supreme Law of the Land for the General Government as has been asserted repeatedly by the US Supreme Court and others (see below) and as such, must be obeyed by the Respondents. 
";All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are null and void. ";  Marbury vs Madison, 5 US (2 Cranch) 137, 174, 176, (1803)
 
";Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.";  Miranda vs Arizona, 384 US 436 p. 491.
 
";An unconstitutional act is not law; it confers no right; it imposes no duties; affords no protection; it creates no office; it is in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed.";
Norton vs Shelby County118 US 425 p.442
 
";The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and the name of law, in in reality no law, but is wholly void, and ineffective for any purpose; since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment, and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it. No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce it.";  16th American Jurisprudence 2d, Section 177, late 2nd, Section 256";
            Petitioners assert that Acts of Congress that are blatantly in opposition to the provisions of the public contracts subscribed to by the United States of America however defined, including The Constitution of the United States of America and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and regardless of which or what kind of Authority the Respondents wish to claim, these acts are by their nature born null and void, ab initio.  All lawful Authorities are equally dependent on the Right to Contract and Right to Due Process, such that any action that derogates these fundamental rights also leads to the destruction of whatever government is proposed. 
            This is as true at Canon Law and under assertion of Divine Right of Kings as it is under Admiralty and the Protestant Declaration of Independence. 
 
Ground 16.  The immediate history related to these issues, that is, the proposed infringement of the Petitioners’ Right to Contract, Right to Due Process, and specifically, their right to assert their Contract of Citizenship proposed by the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012), reveals that the current infringements against contract and general usurpation of authority are part and parcel of actions taken against the Petitioners and their Progenitors beginning in 1933.  The passage of the Patriot Act and the offending provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 merely mark “another chapter” in a long process of fraud, deceit, infringement, and usurpation, from which Petitioners seek immediate and material relief. 
               Petitioners have already demonstrated the existence of three common meanings of the words “United States of America”: (1) the 50 States United,  (2)  Respondents, the US Corporation per Title 28, 3002, (15) (A) (B) (C) and (3) “the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam…..et alia”.   The existence of three such meanings of the same words should give the Justices of the ______________ Supreme Court reason to pause and admit.  Why three common meanings of the same words?  These usages developed naturally and bear materially on the current issues and the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus being presented.  The Petitioners present the documented history leading up to these current acts of the Respondents in support of their Petition:
 
               The United States went ";Bankrupt"; in 1933 and was declared so by President Roosevelt in Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111, and finally, as consolidated in Executive Order 6260, (See: Senate Report 93-549, pages 187 &amp; 594) under the ";Trading With The Enemy Act"; (Sixty-Fifth Congress,  Sess. I, Chs. 105, 106, October 6, 1917), and as codified at 12 U.S.C.A. 95a.
               The several States of the Union then pledged the faith and credit thereof to the aid of the National Government, and formed numerous committees, such as the ";Council of State Governments";, the ";Social Security Administration";, etc., to purportedly deal with the economic ";Emergency"; caused by the bankruptcy. These organizations operated under the ";Declaration of Interdependence"; of January 22, 1937, and published some of their activities in ";The Book of the States.";
               The Reorganization of the bankruptcy is located in Title 5 of the United States Code Annotated. The ";Explanation"; at the beginning of 5 U.S.C.A. is most informative reading.  The ";Secretary of Treasury"; was appointed as the ";Receiver"; in Bankruptcy.  (See: Reorganization Plan No. 26, 5 U.S.C.A. 903,  Public Law 94-564, Legislative History, pg. 5967)  As a Bankrupt loses control over his business, this appointment to the ";Office of Receiver"; in bankruptcy had to have been made by the ";creditors"; who are ";foreign powers or principals";.
               The United States as Corporator, (22 U.S.C.A. 286E, et seq.) and ";State"; (C.R.S. 24-36- 104, C.R.S.  24-60-1301(h)) had declared ";Insolvency.";  (See: 26 I.R.C.  165(g)(1), U.C.C.  1-201(23), C.R.S. 39-22--103.5, Westfall vs.  Braley, 10 Ohio 188, 75 Am. Dec. 509, Adams vs. Richardson, 337 S.W.  2d 911; Ward vs. Smith, 7 Wall. 447)
                A permanent state of ";Emergency"; was instituted within the Union and the Federal Reserve has acted as the ";fiscal and depository agent"; of the “creditors” ever since. Please note that the member banks of the Federal Reserve are all privately owned corporations, 22 U.S.C.A. 286d.
               The government, by becoming a “corporator” (See:  22 U.S.C.A. 286e)  lays down its sovereignty and takes on that character and status of a private citizen. It can exercise no power which is not derived from the corporate charter.  (See: The Bank of the United States vs. Planters Bank of Georgia, 6 L.  Ed. (9 Wheat) 244, U.S. vs. Burr, 309 U.S. 242). 
               The Corporate Charter adopted by the “federal corporation”, aka, US Corp, included The Constitution of the United States of America as its By-Laws. The Constitution of the United States of America remains also as a public contract, which the Petitioners assert is owed enforcement by the State of ___________________, Inc.
                The real party in interest is not the de jure ";United States of America"; or ";State";, but ";The Bank"; and ";The Fund.";  (22 U.S.C.A. 286, et seq., C.R.S.  11-60-103)  These acts committed under fraud, force, and seizure are many times done under ";Letters of Marque and Reprisal"; i.e. ";recapture."; (See: 31 U.S.C.A. 5323)  in behalf of Foreign governments at war. This is an important point to remember as this discussion goes forward in time.
               On March 17, 1993, on page 1303 of Volume 33 of the Congressional Record, Congressman Traficant stated:  ";Mr. Speaker, We are now here in Chapter 11.  Members of Congress are official Trustees presiding over the greatest reorganization of any bankrupt entity in world history, the U.S. Government.";
               The “U.S. government” is the government domiciled in the District of Columbia, which at various times purports to represent three distinct entities: (1) the US Corporation formed as we have just seen and as documented at Title 28, 3002, (15) (A) (B) (C), (2) the “United States of America” defined as the 50 States United or “the Union of 50 States”, and (3) the “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia. In this comment Congressman Traficant was including all three primary meanings of “U.S. Government” as the term “General Government” or “U.S. Government” with a capital “G” is traditionally used in the Congressional Record when this meaning is applied----however, there is no indication that the States ever went “bankrupt” except as voluntary adjuncts. The actual subject of the bankruptcy was the Foreign Corporation known as the “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia.
               This confession by Congressman Traficant applies, not only to ";Members of Congress,"; but also to the Secretary of the Treasury as the ";Receiver in bankruptcy"; and to all state and federal ";officials"; who act under the de facto authority of  that bankrupt Foreign Corporation known as the United States acting as Trustees (that is, Foreign Agents) for foreign principals.  Trustees work for the creditors of a bankruptcy and are agents for foreign principals.
               In this case the creditors are the Federal Reserve Banks, the International Monetary Fund (the Fund) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank).
               It is worthy of note that an Attorney/Representative is required to file a ";Foreign Agents Registration Statement"; pursuant to 22 U.S.C.A 611c(1)(iv) &amp; 612), when representing the interests of a Foreign Principal or Power. (See: 22 U.S.C.A. 613, Rabinowitz vs. Kennedy, 376 U.S. 605, 11 L. Ed. 2d 940, 18 U.S.C.A. 219 &amp; 951).  This same requirement was later extended to non-attorney representatives as required by Trinsey v. Pagliaro.  As a result, every official and every attorney representing this version of “federal government”, and including the Respondents, is a Foreign Agent and under obligation to declare him or herself as such and file the Foreign Agents Registration Statement.
               The contrived ";emergency"; of the bankruptcy has created numerous abuses and usurpations, and abridgments of delegated Powers and Authority as clearly stated in Senate Report 93-549 (1973):
               ";A majority of the people of the United States have lived all of their lives under emergency rule.  For 40 years, [78 years now] freedoms and governmental procedures guaranteed by the Constitution have in varying degrees been abridged by laws brought into force by statutes of national emergency.";
               The current Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus has arisen under precisely this circumstance. The Respondents are claiming that they have Authority to arbitrarily and indefinitely detain Americans without recourse to Due Process, based on unproven allegations of “belligerent acts” against the government. Once again, these infringements are being asserted as a response to an “emergency” situation that doesn’t really exist.
               According to 16 American jurisprudence, 2nd Edition, Sections 71 and 82, no ";emergency"; justifies a violation of any Constitutional provision.  Arguendo, ";Supremacy Clause"; and ";Separation of Powers";, yet it is clearly admitted in Senate Report No.  93-549, that abridgment has occurred.
               On March 6, 1933 the federal government got the Conference of Governors to pledge the faith and credit of the several States of the Union and their citizenry to the aid of the National Government, (see pp. 18 - 24 of The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin Roosevelt, Volume II, The Year Of Crisis, March 6, 1933) for what they openly admitted to doing. They also encouraged the President to ask for and use extra-constitutional powers during the ";emergency"; that continues to this day.  
               This was a completely voluntary action on the part of the Governors acting at that time representing the 50 States United which were NOT the subjects of the bankruptcy.  The Governors arbitrarily claimed to have the granted Authority to commit the full faith and credit of the 50 States and also claimed the Authority to add the full faith and credit of the State’s “citizenry” as credit in behalf of the “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia. 
               The Governors had no such granted Authority. It was FRAUD for them to pledge the faith and credit of the State, which they did not own, as collateral. Likewise it was purely fraudulent for the Governors to claim “ownership” of the citizenry of the State, or claim any granted Authority or possession of any inherent right to commit the “full faith and credit” of the citizenry of the several (50) States in payment of the debts of a Foreign Corporation. 
               The Citizens of the 50 States United are and were private and unincorporated living entities, who never acted or granted authority to anyone to act in their behalf in this manner whatsoever. They (and we) never gave permission to any entity to define them (us) as corporate entities, nor as “debtors” subject to the bankruptcy proceedings of any Foreign Corporation.   The Petitioners and their Progenitors never gave their consent to this action undertaken by the Governors and were for the most part never even made aware of it.
               The Petitioners note:
               ";Emergency does not create power.  Emergency does not increase granted power or remove or diminish restrictions imposed upon power granted or reserved.  The Constitution was adopted IN a period of grave emergency.  Its grants of power to the Federal Government and its limitations of the power of the States were determined in the light of emergency and they are NOT altered by emergency."; [Emphasis added] Home Building &amp; Loan Assoc. v  Blaisdell 290 US 426 (1934).
               The Respondents, Members of Congress, have no “special” or “extra” powers during an emergency, declared or undeclared, yet that is what they specifically and dishonestly claimed in 1933 and what they are continuing to claim as the excuse for their infringements against The Constitution of the United States of America today.  Likewise the Governors of the now 50 States United acting in 1933 had no new, special, different, or greater claim upon the resources of their States or upon the Citizens of those States as a result of any economic emergency affecting the “United States of America” as defined as “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam…..et alia”. 
               Likewise, powers and property interests that the Governors didn’t possess prior to the “emergency” did not magically accrue to them as the result of any emergency, economic or otherwise. Their action pledging the “full faith and credit” of the 50 States and their citizenry was pure fraud and extortion practiced at the level of State government.  As in all cases of fraud, the victims were not notified of any such agreement being made in their behalf, for the simple reason that the Citizens of the 50 States would never have agreed to it.
     ";The Constitution of the United States is a LAW for rulers and people equally in war and peace,  and covers with the shield of its protection ALL classes of men, at ALL times, and under ALL circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was EVER invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of the government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or to despotism."; [Statement of Opinion, U.S. Supreme Court, Annals 1866, in response to a new class of proposed infringing Reconstruction legislation that was similarly promoted on the basis “national emergency”.]
               The property interests of the 50 States United, their land and resources, including the “full faith and credit” of the citizenry so gratuitously offered by the treasonous Governors,  was the collateral accepted by the creditors (foreign principals) so the “federal government” aka, “United States of America” as defined as “the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam…et alia” could borrow more Federal Reserve Notes (private bank credit) and keep operating under reorganization.  Roosevelt issued Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111 and 6260:
               Executive Order 6073 issued on March 10, 1933, created the ";bank holiday"; and closed the doors of the bankrupt government chartered banks (they were bankrupted as a whole because they operated under government charter, and because of the Great Fraud committed by the Governors of the several States, not because they were individually bankrupt).
               Executive Order 6102  issued on April 5, 1933,  prohibited ";hoarding"; gold and required people to turn it (their property) in to the Federal Reserve Banks (the creditors).
               Executive Order 6111 issued on April 20, 1933, prohibited people from exporting gold.
               The affects of this particular Executive Order provide clear and trenchant proof of the fraudulent nature of the claim and the purposeful intent of the foreign government exerting it.     The creditors claimed that the gold no longer belonged to the State Citizens, as a result of having been pledged by their State Governors, one of the first dire results of the many illegal actions taken under the auspices of the Great Fraud.    
               The “United States” did indeed seize the gold and claimed—fraudulently---to assert the credit of the States and citizenry as cited, but because they had to remain in Honor internationally and create a “remedy” equal to the public liability they established, they set up a system whereby the people so defrauded got to charge off all bills presented to them via a process of “debt” forgiveness known as Accepted for Value.
               Of course, the same shiftless, criminal, fraud-mongering government responsible for the thefts and false claims to begin with never bothered to mention this “generous” accommodation to the victims, either, so that only those who were “in” on the con were able to discharge their debts. Everyone else got stuck paying double to the banks. 
               The banks acted as middle men in this whole proceeding and pressed the victims to pay them effectively coming and going----first by providing the banks with “debt credit” in the form of “checks” and secondly by charging off the victim’s “debt” using the Accepted for Value process that was supposedly put in place to repay Americans for the confiscation of their gold and their credit.
               Between the tender mercies of the fraud perpetrated by the “federal government” and the self-interested rape by the banks, Americans were immediately deprived of most of their resources and net worth, even though they were (and are) self-evidently the only source of wealth creation for all the predatory legal fictions represented by the “federal government” and the “banks” and the “banking associations”. The text of this whole arrangement is recorded in H.J. Res 192, 73rd Congress, First Session, principally prior enrolled as Public Law, U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 1, Public Acts, 3rd Congress, 2nd Session, Chapter 48.. 
               Anyone doubting the truth of this has only to haul out their “check” book and read the very, very fine print of the broken line below their signature confirming that the Signature on their check is the “Authorizing” Signature, i.e., authorizing the bank to consider them a “banker” as recorded in Title 12 of Federal Code and to (mis)use their authority to both create the debt credit and the debt discharge, a process known as “twinning” which is extremely illegal, but left to be practiced without oversight or audit of the Federal Reserve Banks.  
               Nobody but the Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for oversight of these “debt accounts” as in “government debt accounts” and he is acting in behalf of the foreign creditors only, so the ability to carry out fraud, extortion, and financial conversion against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, has been limited only by the extent of their ignorance and will to survive.
               Executive Order 6260 issued on August 20, 1933, combined 6102 and 6111.
               All of this is criminal and self-interested fraud, extortion, unlawful conversion, and treason against The Constitution of the United States of America and against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of _______________________. 
               The Governors of the 50 States acting at that time pledged the PUBLIC property of the State, which they didn’t own, and the PRIVATE property of the State Citizens, property over which they had no reasonable authority and upon which they had no valid material claim, to be surrendered in payment of the debts racked up by the “United States of America” as defined by the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia, and so confiscated private property to pay mammoth public “debts” never authorized and therefore never owed by the Citizens of any of the 50 States, all under color of law and a contrived economic “emergency” and in behalf of a Foreign government. 
               The economic raping and pillaging created by the Great Fraud has continued unabated to the present day.  The proclamations issued by FDR gave force to 470 provisions of Federal law.  These hundreds of statutes delegate to the President extraordinary powers, ordinarily and meant to be exercised by a representative Congress, which affect the lives of American citizens in a host of all-encompassing manners.  These unconstitutional powers, taken together, confer enough authority to rule the country without reference to normal constitutional process.
               Under the powers delegated by these statutes, the President may: seize property; organize and control the means of production; seize commodities; assign military forces abroad; institute martial law; seize and control all transportation and communication; regulate the operation of private enterprise; restrict travel; and in a plethora of particular ways, control the lives of all American citizens.  The several States were seduced into the new policy in 1939, with Roosevelt's promise of federal grants-in-aid. 
               Federal Revenue Sharing (31 U.S.C. ( 6700 etseq.) is the modern version of the grants-in-aid program.  In return for these grants and later, other forms of “federal income”, the Governors of the several States agreed to uphold and maintain their completely unauthorized, illegal, and fraudulent pledge of the life, labor and property of their respective citizenry as surety for the debt obligations of the Federal government.  The politicians of these respective states complied, because they viewed this as an opportunity to increase their own political power, and because in point of fact they are operating as municipal franchise corporations of the same Foreign government and its Agents, letting the next generation of office holders worry over the long term consequences of their acts and conveniently “forgetting” to enforce the contract provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America owed the Petitioners, Inhabitants of ______________________.
               The argument can be made that the State of __________________ as a municipal franchise of the “United States of America” as defined as “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico….et alia” cannot sue the parent organization, but that would be inconsistent with International Commercial Law or Admiralty, the only two venues that can be asserted in this instance.  Corporate subsidiaries of all kinds represent individual “persons” holding unique contracts and are perpetually found at Law asserting claims for and against their Franchise Sponsors, as neatly proven by any number of well-known court cases asserted by the State of _____________________________ against the “United States”.
               The Petitioners hold that enforcement of the provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America is not materially different than the State of ________________’s responsibility to enforce other contracts.  The de facto “government” gave up its de jure status entirely in 1933, or rather, fraudulently dissolved it and instituted corporate structures to replace the de jure government, becoming equal in status to any other corporate entity on earth by becoming a “corporator”.  The Great Fraud practiced against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of __________________, does in no way destroy any element of valid contract owed them by the “United States of America” or its subsidiaries, nor does it Extinguish any of their own asserted Natural property Rights.  If anything, the overall conditions of fraudulent usurpation and material harm already done to the Petitioners, Inhabitants of __________________, should lend wings to the feet of both the State of ____________________ Officials responsible for enforcement and demand equally prompt compliance from the “United States of America” and the Named Respondents.
               Petitioners note that these invalid claims against their persons and property interests were the result of collusion between both State Officials and Federal Officials, all busily and happily digging their unwashed hands into the Petitioners’ pocket under cover of darkness and non-disclosure; process via Executive Orders allowed under the presumption of equally invalid “emergency powers” claimed as a result of the banking collapse created by the Federal Reserve Banks manipulating the currency supply and then in predatory fashion calling in debts of the already unreasonable and improper debts of the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, et alia…..” allowed the fraud to be administered largely outside the realm of public cognizance.
               All interested Parties have been duly Noticed that the Petitioners have invoked their proper Rights from under subrogation and are in process to Void Contract absent prompt correction, such that the Respondents and the Officers of the State of ______________________ are under Demand to Perform, just as they would be under International Law if they left any other contract derelict for years at a time, exposed those to whom they owe fiduciary responsibility to the frauds and rapacious demands of entities who are themselves DEBTORS with respect to the Petitioners, not Creditors, and certainly not Masters.  
               The blatant self-interest and Disservice to contract exhibited by the Respondents and their Predecessors in Office may be in part to gross ignorance; Petitioners grant that the Respondents may have been taken in by the Great Fraud just as well as anyone else, and they may think, due to decades of dereliction of duty in this regard on the part of the State of ___________________________,  that they owe no Due Diligence to the Constitution of the United States of America under contract----but in point of fact, they do.
                Petitioners, Inhabitants of _____________________, cannot and do not entertain speculation regarding the intentions, personal motivations, or degree of understanding possessed by any of the Respondents named as parties to this Petition.  The Respondents are being addressed and given Notice as Office holders.  It is not “personal” and it is not necessary for us to establish any malicious intent on the part of the living entities holding Office. 
               Similarly, we do not entertain our charges against the State of _________________ Officials apart from their actions in Office once duly advised.  This is not about vengeance or even getting even. Given the present level of debt these Respondents have engaged in through the misuse, abuse, and inflation of their fraudulent claims against the Honor and credit of the 50 States United and the Petitioners, no such end result may be hoped for.  What can be accomplished is a prompt settlement of these issues in favor of the Petitioners, summarily protecting the Petitioners from any further predations undertaken at the hands of the Repondents and their fellow undeclared Foreign Agents and an end to Miscarriage and Hemorrhage of Justice in Templum Regis.
               This is about the re-assertion of our Natural, Civil, and Human Rights, respectively, in the face of ongoing contract-infringing legislation enacted under conditions of fraud and extortion against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of ______________________, and resulting in the abuse of the credit of the State of _________________and also the Petitioners, Inhabitants of _______________________ created by the Great Fraud.  This is about the  recognition of the Great Fraud itself practiced upon the 50 States United and their citizenry in 1933, and the true nature and meaning of The Constitution of the United States of America as a public contract. The Petitioners, Natural-born Citizens of their Respective States, now inhabiting _________________, are literally owed performance and due diligence that has not been in evidence for entire decades.
               The “consequences” have come home to this generation of State officials. The Foxes have been in charge of the hen house, in self-evident fact, helping their Sponsors to pillage Petitioners by not enforcing the provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America and consenting with obsequious alacrity to all proposals allowing the Respondents to do any outrageous thing they wish to the Petitioners. Fortunately for the Petitioners (and as it turns out, the State of ______________________ Foxes, too) there remains the thorny issue of the underlying Public Contracts to be enforced.  The Petitioners maintain that the State Governors never possessed any such Authority to indebt them nor any valid claim over their private property, nor any vested Authority to commit the “full faith and credit” and thereby the substance of any of the Several (now) 50 States to pay the debts of any Foreign Corporation whatsoever.
               The actual and only existing valid contract between the “United States of America” defined as the 50 States United and the “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, et alia, is “The Constitution of the United States of America” together with its provisions and limitations, both in the services to be provided and the means of payment for those services, which are explicitly stated and whether interpreted as law, contract, or Public Policy, are clearly in evidence and must be accepted as contracts because no level of “government” represented either by the Respondents or the Governor of _________________________ has recourse to Sovereignty over the 50 States United or the Petitioners, Inhabitants of _______________________, by any valid claim, and because by becoming incorporated entities they have no structure competent to function in anywise but under contract as made clear by Erie Railroad v. Thompkins.  
               To the extent that the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia…et alia” and the Respondents have overreached their Authority granted under contract, and abused the credit of the Petitioners and the 50 States United to do it, they are in the same position as an unscrupulous publisher of magazines, who uses the existence of one subscription as an excuse to present other magazines as if subscribed to, and then proposes that the recipients of his unsolicited products and services are under obligation to pay for them.
               No such provision of any kind, now or ever, has existed under any venue of Commercial Law, nor, if anyone should propose, the Law of International Admiralty. The just and universal result of such importunity is that the “magazine publisher” cannot demand payment for any goods or services that have not been knowingly, willingly, and under full disclosure provided under contract. Anything and everything that these Respondents have done in excess of the contract to which the 50 States United subscribed via their fraudulent claims against our credit must be emphatically denied by the Petitioners, Inhabitants of ___________________, and is so denied.
               Furthermore, Petitioners having mistakenly paid (or as in this case, having had their credit abused to do so) for goods or services they didn’t order, are entitled under International Law of Commerce to come forward and describe the fraud practiced against them and claim their innocence and restitution before any court of law having jurisdiction over the subject matter and ask for remedy.  The Petitioners and the 50 States United are the ones defrauded by the US Corporation, dba “United States of America” as defined as “…the District of Columbia, et alia”.
In all such cases and as universally recognized, those defrauded must be upheld.
                The State Citizens were not made aware of these actions in 1933, the consequences were never fully disclosed, and none of it was ever voted upon or approved by the State Citizens so impacted and purportedly “indebted”.  Similarly, the State Citizens were never made aware of any ability to present their own Bills as Bills of Exchange under the Accepted for Value process as remedy for the gold resources confiscated by the “government” in 1933, so that the remedy offered in exchange for the liability the perpetrators established was as vacant of Honor as their pledge of “good faith and credit” made against resources they didn’t own. 
               The original Trust Accounts were valued at $300,000 per person worth of debt repayment, and owing to the fact that two generations of Americans have lived and died without ever knowing they had recourse to any remedy, inflation and market conditions, these Trust Accounts are worth more than $7 million per person of guaranteed “debt repayment credit” on paper now, amounting to the piddly amount of $2.8 billion dollars, more or less,  that the US Corporation undoubtedly owes Americans on a per capita basis, but which in its unreasoning, endless greed refuses to pay except with the most pathetic snarling and ill-will toward the people it robbed and defrauded when they show up and present a Bill for payment.  
               Simply paying off this “petty debt” truly would have been a drop in the bucket compared to all the other spending done by the Respondents via the fraudulent claims made against the Petitioners’ credit and the credit of their States and the gross amounts of taxation added in on top of it all as a pressure valve for the fiat money system.  Many Americans who are literally owed &#064; $7 million per person would have enjoyed keeping their homes, if they had only known (1) that the government absolutely does owe them this money and (2) they have also been the victims of mortgage fraud practiced against them on top of all the rest of the ills which accompanied the insinuation of “fractional reserve banking” into this country. 
               These Acts of the Governors and the Members of Congress and the President of the United States in March of 1933, were blatant, gross, and virulent frauds committed against our Progenitors, and just as it was fraud then, is fraud now, and it cannot be applied by any means of rational argument to the Petitioners. We rightfully and emphatically renounce, deny, reject, and object to any such fraudulent agreements made in our behalf or the behalf of our Progenitors without their knowledge or consent, and certainly without our permission, and we assert our Natural Right (and in the case of “US citizens, Civil Right, and in the case of Non-Foreign entities, Human Right) to be free of the consequences of such constructive fraud, including the 470 separate provisions of Federal Law enacted at that time and those infringing Acts of Congress created since then including those known as the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012. 
               The Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus now appearing should be seen in the larger context of re-securing and preserving the property interests of the Petitioners and the 50 States as required by the still-potent public contracts known as The Constitution of the United States of America  and The Constitution of the State of _____________________ under the Law of Nations. The fraudulent acts of Governors long-dead cannot be held as debt or credit to this current generation, and no presumption of “debt” can be offered based upon fraud. The debts of the “United States of America” comprised of the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia, are precisely that---their debts. Let them conclude their bankruptcy amid Public recognition that the acts of the State Governors in March of 1933 were fraudulent, and that the private property and “credit” of State Citizens was never within the granted Authority of any State Governor to pledge. 
                As an analogy, the Petitioners will willingly Quit Claim all their property interests in the Island of Majorca, but as they have no property interests in the Island of Majorca, the Quit Claim while a valid instrument has no legitimate effect.  In the same way, the Governors of a State may “pledge” their credit and their property interests in a State or in the credit of the State’s citizenry, but if they personally have no such valid property interest, the pledge is valid but vacant of any legitimate claim. The Governors acting in this manner clearly knew that they were committing fraud and treason against the State and against the Citizens, and in favor of the Creditors enforcing the bankruptcy of the “United States of America” as defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia.
               On May 23, 1933, Congressman, Louis T. McFadden, brought formal charges against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank system, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Secretary of the United States Treasury for numerous criminal acts, including but not limited to, CONSPIRACY, FRAUD, UNLAWFUL CONVERSION, AND TREASON.  The petition for Articles of Impeachment was thereafter referred to the Judiciary Committee, and has yet to be acted upon.  (See: the Congressional Record, May 23, 1933, pp.  4055-4058.)
               This is prima facie evidence that the members of the Judiciary Committee have colluded to avoid correction and contractual compliance for almost 80 years.  The Petitioners, unimpeded by any necessity of Articles of Impeachment, denounce the Fraud practiced against them and their Progenitors, and demand that their contractually guaranteed Natural Rights, or in the case of “US citizens” Civil Rights, or in the case of Non-Foreign citizens, Human Rights (under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) must be held inviolate and protected by the State of ____________________________, Inc., under contract,  asserting that although they have been Victims of Fraud in the grossest terms imaginable, they are not in any case made Bankrupts, Debtors, Corporate Entities, rendered “property” of any legal fiction, or obligated to yield their “full faith” or their “credit” by acts of constructive fraud practiced against them by treasonous government officials, foreign or domestic, who never possessed granted Authority or property interest to make such “pledges” in the first place.
               We act sui juris.  We are fully Competent. We are Equal Sovereigns. We are not lessened by false claims against us, nor are our Natural Rights Extinguished by acts of fraud against us and our Progenitors, now or in 1933.
               The Petitioners, Inhabitants of _________________________, have observed through the course of their lifetimes the gradual usurpations of this foreign government calling itself the “United States of America’ without understanding the basis of the usurpation and economic predation. Like millions of others, Petitioners assumed that their government in the past was competent and honest and that whatever situation we now faced, we came to be here via a legitimate process.  Such is not the case. These mechanisms to date have served merely to cheat us, enslave us, and to extort our property interests from us under color of law. 
               We, the Petitioners, Inhabitants of ______________________, and each one of the several (now 50) States United have been the victims of a very high level, wide-ranging, and importunate Fraud promoted by the elected officials of both the State and Federal governments almost 80 years ago. Since then, we have continued to be the victims of Fraud, as these Foreign entities have under color of law and under pretense of being our de jure government subtly infiltrated our institutions, took over our Offices, and abused our credit to do so.  Unavoidably, though, these same “corporate governments” gave up Sovereignty and are not now “governments” with any de jure status.  They are corporations, albeit, very large and complex corporations, claiming before the world to operate under public contracts known as The Constitution of the United States of America and The Constitution(s) of the Several States.  What is claimed in Public must appear to be so and there is no opposition, and as all that ought to have been done must appear to have been done, they have no recourse but to consent to our assertion.   They are corporations by their own hand and under public contract.
               Legal fictions may not claim Dominion against the rightful Sovereigns.
               When asked how the District of Columbia, et alia, is to pay its debts and expenses and obligations now totaling over $15 trillion dollars, the Petitioners answer that the “United States of America” as defined as the District of Columbia et alia, must settle its bankruptcy however it sees fit, and not expect the Petitioners, Inhabitants of ______________________, to provide one penny more in support of them or in payment of services, than what is reasonably owed under the contract plainly stipulated by The Constitution of the United States of America. 
               Petitioners note that that public contract agrees to pay only for services related to the “common defense” of the 50 States United, and that most of the war-mongering and adventurist activities of the District of Columbia et alia, dba,“United States of America” engaged in against foreign countries now and since 1955 do not amount to “common defense” of the 50 States United, and cannot be claimed as our valid expenses. Ownership of all this equipment, all the profits and interests accrued from investment funds established “in Public Trust” and all enterprises paid for, and all property interests, trusts, corporations, funds, organizations, real estate and claims, titles, deeds, warrants, liens and mortgages upon real property made via the unlawful abuse of the credit of the 50 States and the Petitioners, Inhabitants of _______________________, belong by First Right of Payment  in Bankruptcy to those who have created the material basis of the claim.  Furthermore, Petitioners assert that vast amounts of public and private property rightfully belonging to the 50 States United and the Petitioners, Inhabitants of ________________________, have been illegally seized by this bankrupt foreign entity calling itself the “United States of America” and that all payments exacted from the 50 States United and the Petitioners by fraudulent means and in excess of the legitimate costs of services contracted for under The Constitution of the United States of America are now due and owing the 50 States United and the Petitioners, Inhabitants of _________________ and the Citizens of all the other Several, now 50 States, respectively. 
               The Petitioners assert that the continued usurpation of Authority by these Foreign Agents is based on fundamental and intolerable fraud and that their continued importunate and non-contractual operation on American shores is in violation of Public Law and International Edict.  Their continued infringement and lack of respect for the public contract under which they have been allowed to continue “in office” is likewise intolerable.
               The Petitioners assert their Sovereign Authority as living entities whose flesh lives and whose blood flows,  Equals to All Men, Sovereign Lords of Creation, granted Equal Dominion, and admitting no separation between themselves and the Divine, such that no other greater Authority or “Divine Right” may now or ever be claimed against them by the Creditors of the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia” or their Foreign Agents, the President of the United States of America, the Respondents, Members of Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury, Officers of the US Corporation, et alia.
               The Governors of the 50 States responsible for the Great Fraud swore to uphold the several Republican States of the Union, and by their acts and vacant pledges of property and credit not their own, breached their Duty to protect the People/Citizens and their Posterity from fraud, imposition, avarice and stealthy encroachment.  (See: Atkins et al. vs. U.S., 556 F.2d 1028, pg. 1072, 1074, The Tempting Of America, supra, pgs. 155 - 159, also see, 5 U.S.C.A. 5305 &amp; 5335, Senate ReportNo. 93-549, pgs.  69 - 71, C.R.S. 24-75-101).
               It is the Governors, therefore, who primarily acted in insurrection against the American government and who treasonously violated their Oath of Office by entering as Parties to the 1933 bankruptcy and pledging property they did not own in repayment of debts they did not owe.  The Respondents, Members of Congress, have in this regard merely performed their duty owed a Foreign Corporation.  As their actual Oath of Office proves, the Respondents have been more than loyal to the interests of the government they represent, howbeit, the long-standing subterfuge demanded by the Great Fraud resulted in generations of Americans believing tacitly in the existence of a “dual allegiance” on the part of the Respondents, assuming that the Respondents were somehow “both” Americans and United States Citizens. That assumption is also proved wrong:
               ";... the United States is to be regarded as a body politic and corporate.  ... It is suggested that the United States is to be regarded as a domestic corporation, so far as the State of New York is concerned.  We think this contention has no support in reason or authority. ...  The United States is a foreign corporation in relation to a State.";  Merriam's Estate, 36 NE 505, 506 22.   See also: See United States v. Germane, 99 U.S. 508 (1879), Norton v. Shelby County, 118 U.S. 425, 441, 6 S.Ct. 1121 (1866), etc., dating to Pope v. Commissioner, 138 F.2d 1006, 1009 (6th Cir. 1943); where the state is concerned, the most recent corresponding decision was State v. Pinckney, 276 N.W.2d 433,436 (Iowa 1979).
            There is no provision for “dual citizenship” or any “dual allegiance”---See: Title 8 USC §§ 1101(a)(3), (21) and (22) and Public Law, 15 U.S. Stat., Chapter 249, pps 223-224. 
            The Petitioners assert that far from being “representatives” of them or their interests, the Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation, are in fact operating under Oath as undeclared Foreign Agents in behalf of Foreign Creditors. Any assertion that the Respondents, Members of Congress, are valid elected officials representing one of the 50 States United and at the same time, are officers of a foreign government, the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia”, is immediately disproven by both the Public Law cited above and the requirements of Federal Code, thus we have it from both sides of this fence:  the Respondents, Members of Congress, cannot be in “dual allegiance”.  They must either serve the 50 States United, a Protestant government built upon the Sovereignty of All Men, or they serve the Vatican government of the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, et alia.” 
            To the extent that the Respondents, their Kith or their Kin, ever “served” the 50 States United, it has been merely under contract to provide enumerated services. From that Dishonored contract they have fruitfully endeavored to usurp the rightful government and harness the substance of the Continent and the Citizens thereof as slaves to their plow.   
            The Petitioners, Inhabitants of __________________, acting in their separate capacities as Natural-born State Citizens, or as “US citizens” owed equal Civil Rights, or as Non-Foreign entities owed Human Rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, have demanded performance under contract, and require both their freedom and protection from any and all presumed Authorities advanced by the Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation,  in the form of infringing and self-serving legislation, recognizing that these same Respondents, Members of Con
