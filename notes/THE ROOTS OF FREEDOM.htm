I do not believe that I have stressed enough to people just how important it is that they come to a complete understanding of the body of my work BEFORE they are placed under the cross hairs of bureaucratic attack, BEFORE they encounter the agent of the State claiming to have authority over them. <br /><br />It is PARAMOUNT that people understand that while I provide a complete body of work, detailing the foundation of the entire legal structure and framework of the law, from the very first initiation of imposition by a revenue agent through to trial, complete including instruction upon initiating your own case and criminal charge against those who would claim to possess the authority to exert force OVER you, that we seek above ALL ELSE to AVOID conflict and AVOID COURT all together. So how you perform and what is said from your initial stop is very much more important than people are lead to believe, no matter how serious the allegation, whether it is some minor traffic stop/citation or a criminal charge. How you deal with these agents of the State in the very beginning can be the difference between victory and defeat. It is why I have a very strict and very specificily detailed plan of how to conduct yourself during these ";arrests";. And they ARE arrests regardless of what they call them. ANY interference in your performance of lawful rights by an agent of the State IS an ARREST regardless what they call it. ARREST simply means STOP. So if you are doing something and an officer STOPS you, they have arrested you. It is important to understand that police do NOT always have the AUTHORITY to exert influence, force, or to in any way impose themselves upon you nor may they make demands or place orders or command you to perform in ANY way. IF they DO use the threat of FORCE and the COLOR OF AUTHORITY vested in their uniform, while carrying a gun, and they DEMAND or COMMAND or ORDER you to perform without the authority to do so they are liable for those charges, and this is the reason it is wise, although not required to enforce, to have a fee schedule on file BEFOREHAND with the county Sheriff. <br /><br />Understand if someone is forcing you to perform ANY action under threat of force, that generates liability, ORDERS always and I mean ALWAYS generate LIABILITY for a BILL. Even if you have not placed a fee schedule on file you can still bill the State for orders placed upon you by its agents, the same is true for local police departments. The ONLY tool these agents have are OFFERS. If it appears to be more the fundamental objective of the offer is to get you to accept that they have the authority to place orders upon you. KNOWING both your rights, and how to defend them, is the key to true freedom. If they are just an idea that can be violated at any time then they mean nothing. BUT, if they are MORE, and are what I assertively believe and explain that they are, then they are absolutely the highest law. It is comparable to a criminal pulling a gun on you and forcing you to clean their floor. Sure they have a gun so they have the color of authority, but if they do not have a contract YOU get to create the terms of those contracts FORCED upon you, CONTRACTS are FORCED upon you ANY TIME that you are being directed to perform ANY action against your WILL. Police ONLY EVER have the authority to intervene with respect to CRIME. CRIME is ALWAYS AND ONLY a violation of person, property, or fundamental rights. So if an officer has NOT witnessed a breech of the peace as explained, there is no VALIDITY to ANY ";CAUSE OF ACTION";, the elements of which ARE the same as the requirements to satisfy CORPUS DELICTI, also known as STANDING, which consequently is where and ONLY where JURISDICTION arises for a court to HEAR ANY MATTER. The ONLY other manner in which officers are empowered to impose themselves upon another, is when they are in possession of a LAWFUL WARRANT which MUST be signed off on by an actual JUDGE. In other words to get a warrant police have to be able to PROVE the existence of ACTUAL EVIDENCE that a crime has been committed. This nonsense where an officer arbitrarily stops someone without any cause, because of some mere statutory infraction, the less significant the more infuriating, which leads to officers forcing searches upon people and violation of other lawful rights. <br /><br />KNOWING in the very BEGINNING what your rights are BEFORE you even ENCOUNTER an agent of the state, is the most important thing. I have an entire body of work because while it is ideal that people come to my work BEFORE they encounter agents, I KNOW they usually do not come to it until AFTER they have had enough and broken the last straw. I sincerely wish that people, ALL of my members, readers, future readers and members, and everyone else, would simply become well informed as to what their rights are and how to assert and defend them. THIS ALONE can often help people AVOID the courts all together, by putting the PEACE OFFICER in their place when they approach us using their EMERGENCY LIGHTS. I hope that every one is ready to peacefully and lawfully fuck these criminal assholes up, and to destroy the illusions of authority they project upon the screen, a grand interwoven tapestry of artificially manufactured ignorance and fear. Every day more people learn the truth of the power they possess, of who and what they are as opposed to who and what these entities who wish to control everyone, want people to believe they are.<br /><br />Every individual alive is an ENTITY. It is CERTAIN that there are a number of entities, who may work alone or in concert with one another, with the sole intent of controlling mass populations, micromanaged control exerted over everyone psychologically manipulating behavior for the sake of power alone. These slaves to power, do not possess power, that is an illusion, the truth is that they are possessed BY power itself, it is their CRACK, money is simply a means by which they transfer this energy. Banking institutions of this world are at the top all controlled by one individual or a board of very few individuals, these banks implement their influences by POLICY and BILLS according to the contracts they force countries into. They do not just influence the individual's property, but their freedom as well. Virtually ALL natural lawful freedoms have been LEGISLATED AWAY by those who IGNORANTLY CONTRACT away their freedom by PROXY or RE-PRESENTATIVE. Those who instead choose as I do to retain their INDIVIDUAL SOVEREIGNTY and instead of limited liability privilege protection of contract, exercise responsibility and fundamental birthrights, will enjoy a rich lifestyle of freedom that few realize in life. It is the elimination of all fear and anxiety when dealing with PEACE OFFICERS in a public forum. <br /><br />Because fear is ALWAYS rooted in ignorance, and ACTIVE SOVEREIGN WILL is always rooted in WISDOM, KNOWLEDGE is the most sacred and fundamental root of ALL power. The power is within each individual, the illusion is that there is power in any other fictitious entity such as ";STATE";. The STATE is an illusion, is is factually, and very simply, a group of people working together by mutual consent in contractual agreement, agreeing that there is a STATE. The STATE which is CREATED BY the people, can only have the authority OVER the people, which the people themselves have CONSENTED to give in registration contract. And this is how it is ALWAYS done, EVERY SINGLE TIME. THe STATE does not FORCE people to give up their rights nor does it TAKE them from them. People have been manipulated into GIVING UP their rights VOLUNTARILY of their own CONSENT in various REGISTRATION CONTRACTS believing there to be some mandatory obligation of law in existence which requires them to do so when there is not. One cannot have BOTH a lawful birthright so fundamental in nature that it is as unaleinable as that of personal locomotion, to possess property, and at the SAME TIME an OBLIGATION OF LAW to sign over to the STATE that same property, in order to acquire the lawful authority to use and enjoy said property. It is simply not possible. The right to own and enjoy property is such a fundamental right of birth that PROPERTY OWNERSHIP ITSELF, is what is mainly meant by the phrase ";a right to LIfe, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness";. Make no mistake, the ownership of property is a birthright, and the PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, cannot become a possibility, or attainable, while governments can encumber property. <br /><br />So naturally, ALLODIAL, ABSOLUTE, INDISPUTABLE, and COMPLETE ownership of property is the form of ownership that was not just desired by the people, but DECLARED BY THE PEOPLEÂ  to BE in existence, the ONLY form of ownership possible. Understand that ALL registration and ALL clouding of title to property, is a fraud. How do we know? Simple. THIS like MANY of the other rights the people DECLARED, were rights possessed by their former KING. ALL individual Americans, possess ALL of the rights of their former king equally, individually, and undeniably. THIS is the purpose for the DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. And with it we created our OWN law which is based upon SELF GOVERNANCE, and the RULE OF LAW. <br /><br />The Declaration signing however was not the end of the war, so why is it that we celebrate our independence on July 4th in 1776? The date as I mentioned before relates to a phenomenon known as APHELION. The date July 4th was chosen because it is an astronomical and astrotheological symbolization of the separation between ENGLAND and the ORIGINAL 13 COLONIES. In truth the Revolutionary war did not end until 1783 at the signing of the TREATY OF PARIS. There is a REASON why the Declaration of Independence READS like an INDICTMENT of the KING. And the individual rights of the people are so clearly spelled out in it by explaining the egregious violations of the rights of the people perpetrated upon the people BY that ALLEGED king. While it is true that LIFE, LIBERTY (synonymous with freedom ONLY) and the PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS are very broad in scope. They are the foundational root of ALL other rights which bloom from them. The bill of rights contained within the Constitution, which is another subject entirely, ALSO contains various elements of the indictment of the KING contained within the Declaration of Independence, further evidencing additional freedoms and protections of it. The people of this country, individually sovereign, did not seek to install a NEW KING, they wanted NO KING. And it only took physically 2% of the population to win militarily against the most powerful military on the face of the planet at the time. The point is that ANY entity infringing upon the rights of the people in a similar manner to described in the Declaration if Independence as that king did, is a criminal, and is NOT government, NOT a court, NOT a peace officer, but just another criminal in a costume pretending to have authority. I hope that this thread enlightens the people who read it, and that this spreads like wild fire across the country, reminding people of the truth of who they are, and what they are, as well as what we are all doing here. <br /><br />THE BEST WAY TO BECOME INFORMED PREEMPTIVELY THAT EXISTS.
