Passed by Congress May 1, 1810 - Ratified December 9, 1812  ";If any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive, or retain any title of nobility or honour, or shall without the consent of Congress, accept and retain any present, pension, office, or emolument of any kind whatever, from any emperor, king, prince, or foreign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen of the United States, and shall be incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under them, or either of them.";  <br />This Amendment essentially prohibited any lawyer or person with Noble Title from serving in government as it stripped their citizenship. This was to prevent England from subverting American law by ensuring no representative of the B.A.R. or British Accredidation Registry, could enter public service. It is important to remember that as there is nothing abolishing this amendment it is currently the law of the land regardless of it's hidden nature. The following Constitutional points also reinforce this fact regarding titles of nobility.<br />Article 1 Section 9 - Limits on CongressNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State.<br />Article 1 Section 10 Powers prohibited of StatesNo State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.<br />How quickly we all forget The War of 1812. A war I remember being glossed over in history class, as I sat eagerly waiting for my teacher to instruct me in a matter that held my interest, but to my disappointment, not much was covered.<br />The war of 1812 had everything to do with The hidden 13th Amendment.  For over 50 years the 13th Amendment was included in the publications of the Constitution for the united States. it is no coincidence the targets of the English war effort were to destroy evidence of this Amendment's ratification, for without it, they could never subvert our courts and pervert law, which they are now doing. Wait, most people only think we only faught england one time and won in 1776. This is fabricated history.<br />This is the text of the 13th Amendment which has been hidden from history. It would have excluded all lawyers from holding offices of public trust due to their ";OATH OF ALLEGIANCE"; and ";TITLE OF NOBILITY"; to the crown, known as ESQUIRE. Our ocnstitution today while this is unlawfully omitted per it's lawful ratification, holds similar language with the same intent.<br /><br />People need to wake up. The English law society, with aide from the international banks, now owned by the FED, has subverted the rule of law. Do any of us comprehend the brain dead stuff they write? NO it is a different language. We are not meant to comprehend it. Better yet, MOST LAW IN AMERICA IS NOT LAW, IT IS STATUTE, AND THIS STATUTE NONSENSE THAT NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND IS NOT LAW. it is not just a foreign language, it is a foreign language written by men and women who have SWORN ALLEGIANCE to the CROWN when they accepted the TITLE of NOBILITY ESQUIRE. No wonder people do not trust lawyers.<br /><br />In the winter of 1983, archival research expert David Dodge, and former Baltimore police investigator Tom Dunn, were searching for evidence of government corruption in public records stored in the Belfast Library on the coast of Maine.<br /><br /><br />By chance, they discovered the library's oldest authentic copy of the Constitution of the United States (printed in 1825). Both men were stunned to see this document included a 13th Amendment that no longer appears on current copies of the Constitution. Moreover, after studying the Amendment's language and historical context, they realized the principle intent of this ";missing"; 13th Amendment was to prohibit lawyers from serving in government. So began a seven year, nationwide search for the truth surrounding the most bizarre Constitutional puzzle in American history -- the unlawful removal of a ratified Amendment from the Constitution of the United States. Since 1983, Dodge and Dunn have uncovered additional copies of the Constitution with the ";missing"; 13th Amendment printed in at least eighteen separate publications by ten different states and territories over four decades from 1822 to 1860. In June of this year (1991), Dodge uncovered the evidence that this missing 13th Amendment had indeed been lawfully ratified by the state of Virginia and was therefore an authentic Amendment to the American Constitution. If the evidence is correct and no logical errors have been made, a 13th Amendment restricting lawyers from serving in government was ratified in 1819 and removed from US Constitution during the tumult of the Civil War. Since the Amendment was never lawfully repealed, it is still the Law today. The implications are enormous.<br />The story of this ";missing"; Amendment is complex and at times confusing because the political issues and vocabulary of the American Revolution were different from our own. However, there are essentially two issues: What does the Amendment mean? and, Was the Amendment ratified? Before we consider the issue of ratification, we should first understand the Amendment's meaning and consequent current relevance.<br /><br />Again, no evidence of ratification; none of denial.<br /><br />However, on March 10, 1819, the Virginia legislature passed Act No. 280 (Virginia Archives of Richmond, ";misc.' file, p. 299 for micro-film): ";Be it enacted by the General Assembly, that there shall be published an edition of the Laws of this Commonwealth in which shall be contained the following matters, that is to say: the Constitution of the united States and the amendments thereto..."; This act was the specific legislated instructions on what was, by law, to be included in the re-publication (a special edition) of the Virginia Civil Code. The Virginia Legislature had already agreed that all Acts were to go into effect on the same day -- the day that the Act to re-publish the Civil Code was enacted. Therefore, the 13th Amendment's official date of ratification would be the date of re-publication of the Virginia Civil Code: March 12, 1819. The Delegates knew Virginia was the last of the 13 States that were necessary for the ratification of the 13th Amendment. They also knew there were powerful forces allied against this ratification so they took extraordinary measures to make sure that it was published in sufficient quantity (4,000 copies were ordered, almost triple their usual order), and instructed the printer to send a copy to President James Monroe as well as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. (The printer, Thomas Ritchie, was bonded. He was required to be extremely accurate in his research and his printing, or he would forfeit his bond.)<br /><br /><br />In this fashion, Virginia announced the ratification: by publication and dissemination of the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution.<br /><br />There is question as to whether Virginia ever formally notified the Secretary of State that they had ratified this 13th Amendment. Some have argued that because such notification was not received (or at least, not recorded), the Amendment was therefore not legally ratified. However, printing by a legislature is prima facie evidence of ratification. Further, there is no Constitutional requirement that the Secretary of State, or anyone else, be officially notified to complete the ratification process. The Constitution only requires that three- fourths of the states ratify for an Amendment to be added to the Constitution. If three-quarters of the states ratify, the Amendment is passed. Period. The Constitution is otherwise silent on what procedure should be used to announce, confirm, or communicate the ratification of amendments.<br /><br />Knowing they were the last state necessary to ratify the Amendment, the Virginians had every right announce their own and the nation's ratification of the Amendment by publishing it on a special edition of the Constitution, and so they did.<br />Word of Virginia's 1819 ratification spread throughout the States and both Rhode Island and Kentucky published the new Amendment in 1822. Ohio first published in 1824. Maine ordered 10,000 copies of the Constitution with the 13th Amendment to be printed for use in the schools in 1825, and again in 1831 for their Census Edition. Indiana Revised Laws of 1831 published the 13th Article on p. 20. Northwestern Territories published in 1833. Ohio published in 1831 and 1833. Then came the Wisconsin Territory in 1839; Iowa Territory in 1843; Ohio again, in 1848; Kansas Statutes in 1855; and Nebraska Territory six times in a row from 1855 to 1860.<br />So far, David Dodge has identified eleven different states or territories that printed the Amendment in twenty separate publications over forty-one years. And more editions including this 13th Amendment are sure to be discovered. Clearly, Dodge is onto something.<br /><br />The notion the13th Amendment was never ratified, Maybe you can show them that the ten legislatures which ordered it published eighteen times we've discovered (so far) consisted of ignorant politicians who don't know their amendments from their... ahh, articles. You might even be able to convince the public that our US forefathers never meant to ";outlaw"; public servants who pushed people around, accepted bribes or special favors to ";look the other way."; Maybe. But before you do, there's an awful lot of evidence to be explained.<br /> Consider some evidence of its historical significance: First, ";titles of nobility"; were prohibited in both Article VI of the Articles of Confederation (1777) and in Article I, Sections 9 and 10 of the Constitution of the United States (1787); Second, although already prohibited by the Constitution, an additional ";title of nobility"; amendment was proposed in 1789, again in 1810, and according to Dodge, finally ratified in 1819. Clearly, the founding fathers saw such a serious threat in ";titles of nobility"; and ";honors"; that anyone receiving them would forfeit their citizenship. Since the government prohibited ";titles of nobility"; several times over four decades, and went through the amending process (even though ";titles of nobility"; were already prohibited by the Constitution), it's obvious that the Amendment carried much more significance for our founding fathers than is readily apparent today.<br />Even though the Treaty of Paris ended the Revolutionary War in 1783, the simple fact of our existence threatened the monarchies. The United States stood as a heroic role model for other nations, that inspired them to also struggle against oppressive monarchies. The French Revolution (1789-1799) and the Polish national uprising (1794) were in part encouraged by the American Revolution. Though we stood like a beacon of hope for most of the world, the monarchies regarded the United States as a political typhoid Mary, the principle source of radical democracy that was destroying monarchies around the world. The monarchies must have realized that if the principle source of that infection could be destroyed, the rest of the world might avoid the contagion and the monarchies would be saved.<br />Their survival at stake, the monarchies sought to destroy or subvert the American system of government. Knowing they couldn't destroy us militarily, they resorted to more covert methods of political subversion, employing spies and secret agents skilled in bribery and legal deception -- it was, perhaps, the first ";cold war";. Since governments run on money, politicians run for money, and money is the usual enticement to commit treason, much of the monarchy's counter- revolutionary efforts emanated from English banks
