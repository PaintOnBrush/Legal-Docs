Box 247, Junction, Texas  76849  NOTICE OF CONDITIONALACCEPTANCE / NOTICE OF DISCHARGE BY WAY OF SEEKING CLARIFICATION / NOTICE OFPERMANENT ESTOPPEL BY ACQUIESCENCE / NOTICE OF NON PRESENTMENT  NOTICE TO AGENT IS NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL, NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL IS NOTICE TO AGENT   ANSWER TO: “Citation# 9608-543”     Dear Judge Peggy Ragsdale,  <ul><li>The main purpose for this notice is due to the fact that the notice I have (which accompanies the Citation, in the form of a Fee Schedule and other instructions) with Citation # 9608-543, says:  “It is not necessary to contact this office unless you have a question concerning the Citation or need to set up payments”.  I hereby give you the same courtesy.  However, you must respond within 15 days or you will forever create permanent estoppel by acquiescence to all points not refuted, forever barring this matter from being raised again.</li></ul> <ul><li>I am attempting to fulfill the requirements of your notice in honor, however it states I am able to answer online at <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kimblecountyonline.com%2F&amp;h=_AQHDmnWk&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.kimblecountyonline.com\/";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.kimblecountyonline.com\u00252F&amp;h=_AQHDmnWk&amp;s=1";);">www.kimblecountyonline.com</a>, but (1) That website has moved which I have found the new location, of my own due diligence and (2) The ticket referenced has not yet been uploaded to be answered and the site does not state how long it may take for it to be uploadedfor answering and pleadings. This creates a problem, as a default judgments entered against me after just 15 days, long before it is even possible to so answer.  As such, you are receiving my answer via this notice instead.  I am exercising due diligence in using your referenced mailing address to answer this ticket. </li></ul> <ul><li>I accept your notice conditionally. I accept that you are trying to communicate with me, something apparently of great importance, but I hereby discharge your notice by seeking clarification as to exactly what you are trying to tell me. It appears as though you are claiming I owe you money for some reason.  However, the amount is not specified anywhere on this notice I have received from you, nor is there an itemized statement of the charges and amounts of them.  I assume you are claiming I owe you money because the following words appear on the accompanying Fee Schedule presented to me with the Citation: ";Remittance, Cashiers Check, Money Order, Payable and Personal Check";.  In addition to the use of the words on the actual notice/citation:  “Payment of a Fine and Cost”.  I understand that transactions of security interests require the consent of both parties, as do adjudication services thereto and I do hereby deny said consent to engage in any transactions of security interests. The conditions by which I accept this notice of an alleged debt are simple. I request a signed original bill which was not duly presented and a copy of the lawful 2 party contract that makes me liable to pay it. It is clear to me this is not a criminal matter as there is no allegations of a breach of the peace. I will assume that if the information requested, an original signed bill to be duly presented and a copy of the lawful 2 party contract making me liable to pay is not provided, that it does not exist and that I am not liable for the charges. </li></ul> <ul><li>I was exercising my Right of Travel in my private motorcar and was not Transporting Goods/Items/Persons for Profit and therefore, am not subject to Commercial Vehicle and/or Driver requirements to be Licensed, Insured, Registered.  My actions were not a Regulable Privilege, but a Right of Travel upon public roads.  There’s plenty of case law in the state of Texas alone to support my claim, if need be. </li></ul> <ul><li>Let it also be known that I intend to ask questions should this matter go to a trial or a hearing. I intend to discover the validity or lack thereof, of the cause of action against me. I do not see any evidence of testimony in this ticket that indicates there is a complaining party.  There also does not appear to be any valid cause of action at all. I am aware of what a valid cause of action is and how many elements compose one and I do not even see one of those elements alleged against me.  At the arraignment hearing I intend to move to dismiss all charges for failing to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, as there is no actual injured party. I not only intend to question the officer about the validity of the cause of action, but also regarding the elements that compose it. </li></ul> <ul><li>I suggest it is in the best interests of all parties involved that these charges be withdrawn.  As I stated, I do not see any evidence or even allegation of a breach of the peace, standing, corpus delicti, actual or justiciable controversy or a valid cause of action. I await your response which will either inform me the charges have been withdrawn or the date of the hearing at which I will appear to secure discussion and discovery in this matter. I thank you very much for your time and cooperation. </li></ul> <ul><li>I hereby declare attest and swear that all information in this document is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and that I have personal knowledge of the facts contained herein and do accept personal responsibility for all statements made and facts presented.</li></ul>  Most Sincerely,    Autograph: _______________________________ Date: ____ - ____ - ______                 Robert-Michael:  Of the Forgette Family  Notary: _________________________ Date: ____ - ____ - ________
