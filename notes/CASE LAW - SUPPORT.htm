This Document is created to focus together in one place ALL of the various case citations I reference as well as other supporting ";items"; of law. This is a concentration of supreme court cases that have not been overturned as well as sections of American Jurisprudence. Focusing upon the freedom and individual sovereignty of the people, these case citations and other supporting items back up the work that I do. Enjoy these, and USE these to defend your own interests. It is VITAL to understand that no matter what State you live in the rulings of the various supreme courts in thsi country that are in support of the supreme law of the land ARE themselves the supreme law of the land. Where statutory CODE is NOT law at all and very confusing, decisions of the supreme court are worded in common English and thus, become the common law, BECAUSE they are the supreme law of the land and the court's decision is simply upholding that law, case citations can be used to clarify points of law. And under equal protections of law and equal rights, there is a MAXIM, a universally accepted truth of law, that equality under and before the law is paramount. It does not matter what State a case originated in, you are using the case to show parallels while ALSO arguing your own case based upon it's own merits. You COMBINE case law with YOUR case and use case law as a guide. The TRUTH in the end is what the law is, and if you operate upon truth and a good faith belief regarding what you know the truth to be in matters of law, you will always find yourself in a position where you can defend your lawful actions, because they are lawful. “Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.  Miranda vs. Arizona, 384 US 436, 491.  This is a very good citation David, because when we are speaking of rights as in this case, we are speaking of ALL, of the VAST plethora array of interlaced freedoms what weave the grand tapestry of  individual sovereignty we enjoy today. Hale Vs. Henkel., 201 U.S. 43 at 74 (1906) is another excellent citation, and I use this for people to assist them with the intimidation of child protective service type agencies. These agencies prey on ignorance and operate through fraud as a matter of routine. They violate rights even homicide detectives will not trespass upon out of fear they will get their case tossed out of court if they do. But in the name of the children of course people tolerate much more egregious travesties to be committed against their rights, a living atrocity. When it comes to our children we should be especially knowledgeable. I can understand people being ignorant and indifferent to the State walking on THEIR freedoms, but I cannot understand how people can tolerate their own indifference and ignorance with respect to their kids. And often it is not until the State has made an aggressive move in the form of legal posturing, intimidating threats, and investigations, that most people come to my work. My one regret is that most, and more people, do not come to my work BEFORE they have been approached.   People have such a willingness to please and are so genuinely good hearted that they will voluntarily open their doors to an investigation, not aware that the investigators do not care about the truth, but what will make them appear to be serving a purpose. In a perfect world of course having nothing to hide you should have no problem inviting investigations, but this is not a perfect world, and if we did this we would constantly be under investigation. To begin with, these child services agencies seem to believe that they do not require evidence or a valid cause of action just like the police believe they do not when they stop people on the roads. They will violate your rights and FIND SOMETHING wrong to meet their quota and call it doing their job. These people have been deceived by their own employers and worse, their own ambitions, placing their careers above the truth. OPENING your door to an investigation voluntarily is the most certain way to ensure they convict you fo something.   Cooperating with the police is NEVER advisable, and CPS are no different from police. They are agents of the State, they require warrants to access your private property, and they require EVIDENCE OF A CRIME known as PROBABLE CAUSE to get those warrants. There is no such thing as ";REASONABLE cause";. Just like an officer cannot get a warrant to search a random guy on the street based upon a hunch, CPS cannot acquire a warrant based upon some 3rd party complaint which is usually filed with questionable motives. Agencies of child protection receive complains all the time, and the percent which THEY THEMSELVES admit are unfounded complaints intended to cause harassment to people out of spite is 70%. So only 30% of complaints to child protection are valid and involve GENUINE neglect or abuse. The worst thing ANYONE can do is become a witness against themselves in ANY kind of investigation. Make no mistake, when these people are asking you questions, everything you say CAN and WILL be used AGAINST YOU, they will NEVER use ANYTHING you say for your BENEFIT.  But I digress, here are some citations that are magnificent.THIS is why all of this statutory contractual registration maritime admiralty nonsense is 100% voluntary. You CANNOT be obligated to it WITHOUT your consent, because without your consent it DOES NOT ever acquire the FORCE of law. So ANY act that violates the constitution or the rights of the people, is null and void UNLESS they have consented to STAND UNDER that act of their own free will.   Precedent - Cases that have NOT been overturned a VAST array of cases that apply to all of the Sui Juris philosophies and methodology. The practice of Law is an occupation of common right, the same being a secured liberty right. (Sims v. Aherns, 271 S.W. 720 (1925))No state may convert a secured liberty right into a privilege, issue a license and fee for it. (Murdock vs Pennsylvania 319 US 105 (1943))The practice of Law can not be licensed by any state/State. (Schware v. Board of Examiners, 353 U.S. 238, 239 (1957))  Should any state convert a secured liberty right into a privilege, charge a fee and issue a license for it, one may ignore the license and fee and engage in the exercise of the right with impunity. (Shuttlesworth vs City of Birmingham 373 U.S. 262 (1962))   “If you’ve relied on prior decisions of the Supreme Court you have a perfect defense for willfulness.” (U.S. v. Bishop, 412 U.S. 346),  ";All acts of legislature apparently contrary to natural right and justice are, in our laws and must be in the nature of things, considered as void. The laws of nature are the laws of God; whose authority can be superseded by no power on earth. A legislature must not obstruct our obedience to him from whose punishments they cannot protect us. All human constitutions which contradict his laws, we are in conscience bound to disobey. Such have been the adjudications of our courts of justice."; (Robin v. Hardaway, 1 Jefferson 109, 114 (1772)). ` The Supreme Court has warned, ";Because of what appear to be Lawful commands on the surface, many citizens, because of their respect for what appears to be law, are cunningly coerced into waiving their rights, due to ignorance."; (U.S. v. Minker, 350 U.S. 179, 187)the general misconception among the public being that any statute passed by legislators bearing the appearance of law constitutes Law. THAT A statute is not a ";law,"; (Flournoy v. First Nat. Bank of Shreveport, 197 La. 1067, 3 So.2d 244, 248), a concurrent or joint resolution of legislature is not ";a law,"; (Koenig v. Flynn, 258 N.Y. 292, 179 N.E. 705, 707; Ward v. State, 176 Okl. 368, 56 P.2d 136, 137; State ex rel. Todd v. Yelle, 7 Wash.2d 443, 110 P.2d 162, 165),“Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.  Miranda vs. Arizona, 384 US 436, 491. ";The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and the name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void, and ineffective for any purpose; since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment, and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it. No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce it.";16th American Jurisprudence 2d, Section 177, late 2nd, Section 256";All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are null and void."; Finding that the statute conflicted with the Federal Constitution, Marshall considered it “the essence of judicial duty” to follow the Constitution.He concluded that “the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void; and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument” It is a proposition too plain to be contested, that the constitution controls any legislative act repugnant to it; or, that the legislature may alter the constitution by an ordinary act. Between these alternatives there is no middle ground. The constitution is either a superior, paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and like other acts, is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it… . If the former part of the alternative be true, then a legislative act contrary to the constitution is not law: if the latter part be true, then written constitutions are absurd attempts, on the part of the people, to limit a power in its own nature illimitable. Marbury vs Madison, 5 US (2 Cranch) 137, 174, 176, (1803)";The claim and exercise ...of a constitutional Right cannot be converted into... a crime."; Miller vs. U.S., 230 F. 486, 489.";There can be no sanction or penalty imposed upon one because of this exercise of constitutional Rights."; Snerer vs. Cullen, 481 F. 946";For while a Citizen has the Right to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, that Right does not extend to the use of the highways, either in whole or in part, as a place for private gain. For the latter purpose no person has a vested right to use the highways of the state, but is a privilege or a license which the legislature may grant or withhold at its discretion."; State vs. Johnson, 243 P. 1073; Hadfield, supra; Cummins vs. Homes, 155 P.171; Packard vs. Banton, 44 S.Ct. 256;The RIGHT of the Citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, by horse-drawn carriage, wagon, or automobile, is NOT a mere PRIVILEGE which may be permitted or prohibited at will, but a COMMON RIGHT which he has under his right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Under this constitutional guarantee one may, therefore, under normal conditions, travel at his inclination along the public highways or in public places, and while conducting himself in an orderly and decent manner, neither interferring with, not disturbing another's RIGHTS, he will be protected, not only in his person, but in his safe conduct. (Emphasis added). See: 11 American Jurisprudence 1st., Constitutional Law, § 329, page 1123.";The use of the highways for the purpose of travel and transportation is not a mere privilege, but a common and fundamental Right of which the public and the individual cannot be rightfully deprived."; [emphasis added] Chicago Motor Coach vs. Chicago, 169 NE 22; Ligare vs. Chicago, 28 NE 934; Boon vs. Clark, 214 SSW 607; 25 Am.Jur. (1st) Highways Sect.163.  “A state may not impose a charge for the enjoyment of a right granted by the federal constitution. Thus, it may not exact a license tax for the privilege of carrying on interstate commerce” (this case is more important than one would think at first glance, but its scope is truly vast, as you can simply replace the right specified in that case, with ANY right). Murdock vs. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105.  “Law of the Land” means “The Common Law.” Taylor vs. Porter, 4 Hill. 140, 146 (1843)  ";Personal liberty -- or the right to enjoyment of life and liberty -- is one of the fundamental or natural rights, which has been protected by its inclusion as a guarantee in the various constitutions, which is not derived from nor dependent on the U.S. Constitution... It is one of the most sacred and valuable rights as sacred as the right to private property...and is regarded as inalienable."; 16 C.J.S. Const. Law, Sect.202, p.987. Teche Lines vs. Danforth, Miss., 12 S.2d 784; Thompson vs. Smith, supra.  ";An unconstitutional act is not law; it confers no right; it imposes no duties; affords no protection; it creates no office; it is in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed."; Norton vs Shelby County118 US 425 p.442The Individual may stand upon his Constitutional rights as a citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no duty to the State or to his neighbors to divulge his business, or to open his doors to an investigation, so far as it may tend to incriminate him. He owes no duty to the State, since he receives nothing there from, beyond the protection of his life and property. “His rights are such as existed by the Law of the Land (Common Law) long antecedent to the organization of the State, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the Constitution. Among his rights are a refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his property from arrest or seizure EXCEPT under warrant of THE LAW.” (not warrant of a statute) He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights.” Hale Vs. Henkel., 201 U.S. 43 at 74 (1906)CHILD SERVICES CASES“A parent’s right to the custody of his or her children is an element of “liberty” guaranteed by the 5th Amendment and the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.” Matter of Gentry, 369 NW 2d 889, MI App Div“a parents right to care and companionship of his or her children are so fundamental, as to be guaranteed protection under the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.” In re: J.S. and C., 324 A 2d 90; 129 NJ Super, at 489.
