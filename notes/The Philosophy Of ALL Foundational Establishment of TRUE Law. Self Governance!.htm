Every now and then a post I put up is SO profound and far reaching in its implications that i MUST not allow it to simply slip down the page in the threads, yet at the same time a new post warrants being pinned to the top. A post so prophetic and massively far reaching in its gravitic conemplation, that it must be immortalized by a FILE instead of a mere simple posting.There are times, when in the due course of good conscience, people must refuse to blindly obey certain orders, or to acknowledge certain rules, those specifically in question would be those that simultaneously acknowledge individual sentience, but ignore the most basic of individual rights and individual autonomy. In a moment of absolute exhaustion in a state half between wake and sleep, again, my greatest philosophical contributions to consciousness itself as a whole, come to light. How is it that something so basic and obviated by several millenia of historical example, could have remained so obscured and hidden in the darkest corner of our minds, shrouded by the confortable euphamisms of, PROPERTY, or SUBJECT. What is the purpose of Sui Juris Law people have and will continue to ask long after I, and the rest of us, and our remains have turned to dust and ash remembered only by the winds breath, and our contributions, deeds, and indeed GIFTS to the future of mankind, are carried only by legend and parable as those who have come before us? It is simple. This group, this effort, this work I do, often at the expense of my own health, but as today, never to my detriment, knowing when to break and recharge, will continue to exist and continue hopefull to inspire long iinto the future, to remember those basic guiding principles of individuality, that INDIVIDUAL rights, INDIVIDUAL sovereignty, and yess indeed INDIVIUAL AUTONOMY, save at the expense of the rights and freedoms of any other individual, ARE themselves the cornerstone building blocks of something much larger destined to reshape the entire world we pereive around us by reshaping our very perceptions o a microcosmic scale that will have lasting implicatins in macrocosmic reality long into the future. People would ask why I would embark upon such a daunting journey, take on such an enormous responsibility, and literally risk the very little, miniscule, mere shadow of freedom that individuals are accorded to enjoy in today's society. It is because consciousness itself demands no less as honor and integrity demand no less and perhaps that the miniscule will finally be viewed in mass perception as being as inadequate and infinitessimally constructed compared to the monument it could become if men and women did not lack the courage to envision what we truly are and even more so, what we might become. Sometimes the ONLY path to freedom is to hold on to those foundational cornerstone building blocks that so many have payed lip service to throughout the ages. Some times, once again getting back to the heart and point of this latest half conscious rambling of brilliance, that I recognize not in arrogance, but in awe that I am the one privileged enough to recognize and share it, it is necessary in the course of doing what is right, to break certain rules that bind and restrict consciouness's freedom to expand. This is as much an individual expansion as it is a collective, and as much an INDIVIDUAL right as it is a collective right, which so long as it hinders the freedom of no other, should be free itself to evolve naturally. That is the source and core goal of Sui Juris Law. LITERALLY to return, not just man, but the spirit of consciousness itself, back to a state of self governance, acting of his own right, own will, own oath, own law. A word where people of conscience choose to do what is right above what is legal, wen it comes to the behavioral legislation of moralities which effect ONLY the INDIVIDUAL, which IS ITSELF the core subject and objective of ALL established law. Contemplate it, and then live it. If you dare. It is not for the timid, but then again, those who are self aware should never shrink from a challenge to individual freedom. For no challenge should ever be allowed to prevail against the spirirt of consciousness while men and women ARE, and I submit they ARE, of good conscience.
