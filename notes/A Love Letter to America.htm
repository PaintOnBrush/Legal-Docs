A Love Letter to America
From the German Poor Orphans
Alma von Liechtenstein
 
          Most of us identify with our name.  Even those who have popular names like “Don Johnson” and “Joe Smith” are vaguely surprised and uncomfortable when they meet someone who has the same name.  Most of us would feel angered and frightened by the idea of someone else using our name to conduct business, and with good reason.  Long before the information age brought us the plague of computerized identity theft, the greatest practitioner of the art was the US Government. 
          When you sign up with the Social Security Administration, having been told (falsely) that it is a condition of employment (only federal employment) and that you have to have a Social Security Number before you can have a job, you are issued a number and a name.  Look at your Social Security Card.  There’s your number and your name, right?  It looks like your name, doesn’t it?  The only difference is that it is printed in all capital letters like this:  DON JOHNSON.
          This is called “Capitus Dominius Maxima” and it is the time-honored way used around the world to name corporate entities----corporations, trusts, transmitting utilities, foundations, and numerous other forms of legal fictions----are all and always named using all capital letters.  When we see the name Elizabeth Arden, we should know we are talking about a living person, but when we see ELIZABETH ARDEN we should equally know that we are talking about a corporation.
          Seeing our own names in all capital letters on our Social Security Card should immediately tell us that the name on the card represents a corporate entity, and in this case, though you are never told this, the corporate entity is a trust and transmitting utility.
          What?  I’m a trust and transmitting utility? 
          No, you’re not, but you’ve been given notice and proof printed on that little card that there is a corporate entity that is using your name, and if your name is Felix Schnickelgruber, its name is FELIX SCHNICKELGRUBER.   This is called “mirroring” and it is the first step toward two highly illegal financial practices called “twinning” and “unlawful conversion”, both of which are about to be practiced upon you by banks and corporations masquerading as your lawful government. 
          As soon as you signed up with the Social Security Administration a number of things happened----chief among them, you were identified as a “US citizen” and as a person who voluntarily submitted to federal jurisdiction (that’s the “voluntary” part of “voluntary income tax”). 
          Next, your name was given to the Secretary of the Treasury (of Puerto Rico) and the Department of the Treasury (of Puerto Rico) drafted up the paperwork to establish a trust and transmitting utility using your name.  When they hand you your Social Security Card they are introducing you to a trust and transmitting utility that is using your name and is associated with a nine-digit number written in the form XXX-XX-XXXX. 
          This Social Security Number is also a Taxpayer Identification Number, and when it is written in this form with all the dashes, it represents the negative side of an account ledger, the debt side.  This is the number that is always used when making payments to the US Treasury.  When it is written with a zero in front of it and no dashes, this same number becomes an Employer Number, and that is used when receiving payments from the US Treasury.  
          This isn’t your account we are talking about.  You, the living person, don’t have a Social Security Number or a retirement account or a Taxpayer Identification Number or an Employer Number, either.  These are all things belonging to and only associated with the trust and transmitting utility that the Secretary of the Treasury (of Puerto Rico) and the Department of the Treasury (of Puerto Rico) created using your name.
          All these years you have merely been acting as an “Acceptance Agent” for the trust and transmitting utility established using your name, and the trust and transmitting utility belongs to the US Treasury, not to you.   Your bank account belongs to the trust and transmitting utility. You have been “donating” your paycheck to it regularly for years, thinking that it was your bank account and your money, but no, it all belongs to you-know-who.  Just look at your checks, your bank statements, all your records are clearly addressed in Capitus Dominius Maxima.
          On the good side, all “your” debts belong to the trust and transmitting utility, too.  You only think you owe the IRS and the mortgage company and the car dealership and the college loans you racked up.  In truth, just as the trust and transmitting utility owns your bank account, your house, your land, your car, and your college loan, the trust also owes all those debts. 
          As you can see, you’ve been stupidly “donating” all your money to this trust and transmitting utility that belongs to the US Treasury, and working yourself senseless to pay all the debts it owes, when what you should be doing is acting as a conscious Acceptance Agent and “discharging” the debts of this trust and transmitting utility and making the US Treasury pay for its franchise’s expenses.
          If the US Treasury owns everything, the US Treasury can pay for it.   
          Actually, technically, nobody can make any “payments”.  “Pay” is a word associated with transactions that use real money.  Since 1933, America has increasingly functioned by using the equivalent of paper casino chips that represent debt and credit exchanges and transfers.  Since 1971, these paper casino chips called “Federal Reserve Notes” have been the primary legal tender in America.  Federal Reserve Notes are a private bank script, issued by the Federal Reserve Banks.
          The Federal Reserve itself is an association of private banks and is as “federal” as Federal Express.  Just as the name of this organization is a purposeful semantic deception, the Federal Reserve Notes (FRNs) are a physical deception.  Everyone calls them “dollars” but they only bear a physical resemblance to real “US Dollars” which remain the Reserve Currency of the entire world.  The Federal Reserve Notes are cheap privately counterfeited copies that don’t even meet the legal definition of a “note” because they don’t promise to deliver anything to anyone upon presentment, and in fact, the one thing that the Federal Reserve Notes do represent is debt.
          Whose debt? 
          FRNs individually represent debts of the Federal Reserve Banks, because a debt for them is a credit for you, the real you, who lives in the real world.  This is why this form of monetary system is called “a debt credit system”.  Everything is reduced down to either a debt or a credit, and there are only three things that can be done with a debt or a credit.  They can be transferred, converted, or exchanged.
          Transfers are uni-directional.  Think of a game of hot potato.  It’s the same game whether you are transferring debts or credits.  Each time you move a debt or a credit it is a discrete little bundle going in one direction, either to or from someone or something else.
          Conversions are where debts turn into credits and vice versa.  The debt of the Federal Reserve Banks creates a credit for you, while your debt creates a credit for them.   
          Exchanges are trades that go in two directions and cancel each other out. When you give a clerk at a sandwich shop $5 and he gives you a sandwich, you are both pleased with the result and you both get something out of it, but any gain is merely subjective.  It’s a “zero sum transaction”.
          Keep these three possible things that you can do with a debt or a credit firmly in mind: transfers, conversions, and exchanges.  There are two realms of commerce using these debts and credits.
          The realm of public sector commerce is inhabited entirely by corporate entities---corporations, trusts, foundations, transmitting utilities-----and each one of these organizes its financial operations around a fiscal year that they set to suit themselves.  Corporate entities have the privilege of corporate indemnity.  If a corporate entity goes broke or accumulates insurmountable debt the public takes the loss and the corporate shareholders, officers, and investors are protected from losing their own private property as a result.  All such privileges are taxable. Corporate entities operate using transfers of debts and credits, and if they show a profit, that accrual is known as “income”.  Only corporate entities have “income”.  Only corporate entities have privileges that are subject to an excise tax-----an “income tax”. 
          The realm of private commerce is equally well-defined.  It is inhabited entirely by Living Persons, operates according to the universal calendar year, operates only via exchanges, and when a gain is realized, it accrues as “property”.  Living persons operating in private sector commerce receive no relief from their debts.  If they produce a bad product, they can be sued and can lose everything they own.  There is no privilege involved, and any private property arising from private commerce is not taxable by definition.         
          The US Supreme Court has ruled on this exact topic many, many times and the answer has always been the same: “property” includes all wages and the earnings of any kind gained in private sector commerce, and property is not taxable.  See Eisner v. Macomber 252 US 189 (1918), Coppage v. Kansas, 236 US 1, Staples v. United States, 21 F.Supp 737 at 739, Slaughterhouse Case, 16 Well. 36, 130; Stratton’s Independence v. Howbert, 231 US 399, Butcher’s Union Co. v Crescent City Co. 111 US 746, Adair v. United States, 208 US 161, 172, et alia. 
          By now you are thinking---so how is it that I am stuck paying an income tax, when “income” by definition is a uniquely corporate thing?   The only corporate entity that I am in any way associated with is the trust and transmitting utility that the Department of the Treasury (of Puerto Rico) created using my name, and which they own. I have never received a penny of corporate “income” from it in my life. 
          What’s going on here?
          Unlawful conversion.  
          The “Department of the Treasury (of Puerto Rico)” and your bank are colluding to convert your private property into their corporate income.  Since you agreed to give all your money to this corporate entity that is using your name, when you deposit your property into the federally owned trust and transmitting utilities’ bank account, it automatically becomes ---“corporate income” and, it becomes subject to the income tax. 
          So the federal government and the banks are conspiring to cheat you, and doing a good job of it, too.  The government has its excuse lined up.  When you signed up for Social Security---according to them----you asked  them to set up the trust and transmitting utility in your name, because you officially applied to be recognized as a “US citizen” and to participate in all the obligations and benefits thereof. 
          Specifically, you signed up to receive benefits from the Public Charitable Fund set up to provide social welfare relief to freed black slaves after the Civil War, part of a “package deal” to undermine the citizenship guarantees of everyone who wasn’t in on the scam, and included in the 14th Amendment.  Read the Extradition Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and both the 13th and the 14th Amendment.  The elite white folk could bail out, using the Extradition Act.  Everyone else became a “US citizen” and from then on, it was just a process of getting each new generation to give their official individual consent to being a “US citizen”----which, according to the government, you knowingly did when you enrolled with the Social Security Administration.  
          Since then you have reconfirmed your doom on any number of federal documents that have asked you, “Are you a US citizen?” and then provided only a yes or no answer.
          As you will realize from reading these historical documents, the fix was in even way back then.  While loudly proclaiming the abolishment of slavery in America with the 13th Amendment, the criminals in Congress opened up the door to a new and much broader kind of slavery with the 14th Amendment.  Private ownership of slaves was outlawed, but a new era of public ownership of slaves was just beginning, and this time, people of any color could be owned by the government.
          This is admittedly an outrageous statement.  It is also true.  Where do you think the term “human resources” comes from?  That comes from looking at people as property in exactly the same way that we speak of “natural resources”.  There are only two elements to any economy----natural resources and labor. 
          The 19th century industrialists were keenly aware of that fact, and so was the government. The wealth of the Southern States wasn’t only in land and crops.  It was also in labor.  Seizing hold of the labor force of the freed slaves represented a very major economic benefit to the victors.  Then the question became----how can the government further expand on this theme and extract the wealth that is inherent in labor from the whole population? 
          Establishing some basis for a claim on the People’s labor was the first job to be done, and the 14th Amendment accomplished that aim.  By establishing this new class of citizenship and the Public Charitable Trust that went with it, the government could claim two vital things. First, it could claim that US citizens had only “civil rights”, not Natural and Unalienable Rights.  This is because unlike your Natural born American Citizenship, “US citizenship” is a privilege conferred by the government.  What the government giveth, the government can taketh away, and redefine, and tax, and enslave, and that is exactly what the US Government has done to the American People. 
          Second, it could claim the existence of a contract between you and the government, based on “equitable consideration”.  You are presumed to have agreed to donate your labor to the government in exchange for the benefits you receive from the Public Charitable Trust, though in fact you receive no “equitable” consideration at all.  
          In order for any contract to be valid, it must be entered into knowingly, willingly, and under conditions of full disclosure, and it must represent “equitable  consideration”---it must be fair, not grossly and self-evidently benefiting one party over the other.   Well, what do you say?  When you signed up for Social Security, did you knowingly, willingly, and under conditions of full disclosure agree to waive your Natural and Unalienable Rights and give all your property, including your labor and body, to the government?  Did anyone ever tell you any of this? 
          No.  That’s the whole point.  You were never meant to know.  If you found out, you could do something about it.  You could defend yourself in a court of law. You could be free again. 
          Your bank also has a plausible deniability excuse in place.  They “presume” that you were knowingly acting as an “Acceptance Agent” for the trust and transmitting utility that was created in your name.  After all, they can’t keep track of who is depositing money into accounts.  If you want to give all your money away to a trust and transmitting utility you never heard of, it’s a free country.
          So now you know how your non-taxable property earned in private sector commerce---your earnings and wages and salaries---gets converted into public corporate income and thereby becomes taxable for the purposes of the federal income tax.  There’s just one other thing you need to know about this.  The IRS works as a collection agency for the banks and every penny of “federal income tax” you have ever paid has gone directly into the pockets of the same privately owned banks.
          In other words, the banks get the benefit of the money they cut out of you via federal taxes.  The same privately owned banks that enable the unlawful conversion of your non-taxable private property into the taxable corporate income of federally owned trusts and transmitting utilities are the ones that get the resulting “tax” money.
          There is one other scam that misrepresents you, the Living Person, in a way analogous to this.  The federal government claims that your Birth Certificate is in fact a Berth Certificate, a type of docking manifest used by the shipping industry worldwide.  The phony government then claims that you are a “US vessel” subject to “marine salvage” and that you, the Living Person, are a member of the Merchant Marines representing that vessel. 
          The set up is very similar to the trust and transmitting utility sting. In that case, the government claims that you are an Acceptance Agent and General Partner of a federally owned franchise organized as a trust and transmitting utility operating under the same name as yours.  In the Merchant Marine scam, the federal government claims that you are a Merchant Mariner acting as the agent of a US vessel having your name. 
          The trust and transmitting utility set up is used against you at the initial level of an IRS claim entered with the foreign statutory court called the US Tax Court. If you continue to fight, they kick you upstairs to the US District Court, which is another foreign court operating under International Admiralty jurisdiction. 
          These crazy claims about you, the Living Person, are necessary because the perpetrators cannot enforce any claim against you otherwise.  Statutory courts can only address corporations and have no jurisdiction over Living Persons whatsoever.  So, to make you “stand under” statutory law, they have to “redefine” you as a “statutory citizen”---that is, a corporate entity.  Admiralty courts can only address maritime subjects and have no jurisdiction over you as a Living Person on the Land.  Same story.  To enforce a claim against you, the Living Person, the rats have to cook up a claim that you, the Living Person, are actually a “US vessel”, and then explain away your presence as a member of the Merchant Marine acting as a Salvage Agent for the vessel.
          Anytime a Judge asks you if you “understand” the charges against you, you should immediately realize that he or she is asking you if you “stand under” the charges, that is, if you submit to their jurisdiction and accept being tried in their court. You answer should obviously be, no, I don’t “under stand” the charges.  Period.
          By long-standing international declaration, all Americans are sovereigns. You are not a corporation, not a marine vessel, and, though this is going to come as a big surprise, you are not a citizen of the “United States”, either. 
          All this is outrageous, but it is also true.  If you are ever brought to trial in an Admiralty Court (US District Courts are all Admiralty Courts without exception) you are “interpreted” by the court and “presumed” to be a Merchant Mariner acting as a Salvage Agent for a derelict vessel named DON JOHNSON or whatever you name is,  when you walk through the door. 
          You must object that as a Living Person on the Land, they have no jurisdiction over you, and while you may act as a Salvage Agent for DON JOHNSON, you are not a member of the Merchant Marines.
          In order to enforce any of their frauds against you, the perpetrators must rely on the Law of International Admiralty and the Roman Merchant Law, neither one of which apply to Living Persons born in one of the 50 States United----only to “US vessels” and to corporations, respectively.  If you are not a US vessel and are not a corporation, there isn’t a court in America that can touch you. 
          It is essential that you immediately challenge the jurisdiction of these courts and never let them bring you into their venue.  As we state, the only way out of the Bar Association Trap is to never go in.  You do this by always answering any of their claims by making a “Special Appearance” as a Living Person. 
          You never, ever offer any petition, answer, motion, or take any other action with respect to yourself as a Living Person, except by Special Appearance and you never allow them to call you a “Plaintiff” or “Defendant” or “Petitioner” or whatever else they may want to make of you. 
          You are a Living Person.  You are a Special Appearant.  You do not consent (to the court’s jurisdiction) and you waive any unearned benefits (of “US citizenship”)
          Stating it that way makes the situation explicit for the judge.  They cannot possibly misunderstand who you are and what your intent is. You are a Living Person making a Special Appearance to inform the court and nothing else. 
          Some people are unnecessarily sacrificing their earned benefits, like Social Security payments and payments due as a result of the gold seizures, thinking that they can’t receive payments from the federal government and still be free.
          If you earned a benefit, meaning that you paid for it, it’s yours.  Collect.  Even if you wind up collecting more than you actually paid in, dollar for dollar, the profit the fake government corporation made on you is far more than you can ever collect back from it in this lifetime.
          If you choose to act as an Acceptance Agent or Marine Salvage Agent, you can address the court in the same way a lawyer addresses the court—that is, you can retain your separate identity as a Living Person and you can act via Special Appearance as a non-attorney and you can make motions in behalf of the trust or the vessel to your heart’s delight without allowing the court to impose its jurisdiction on you, the Living Person.
          Just keep in mind---the court has no jurisdiction over you, the Living Person, until and unless you hand it to them and consent to their jurisdiction.  They will be trying every trick in the book to importune your cooperation and misinterpret your statements, trying to find an excuse to claim jurisdiction over you, so you must be explicit and clearly state your role.
          When you, the Living Person, address one of these courts via Special Appearance and deny consent to their jurisdiction, you may also want to reply to the claims being made against you, the trust named after you (statutory courts), or the vessel named after you (admiralty courts).  Just keep in mind that any motion you present to the court can only be a “recommendation” if it pertains to you as a Living Person, otherwise you are handing them the keys again.
          Almost all actions undertaken by the Admiralty Court (aka US District Courts) are fed to them by the statutory courts.  In statutory court they accuse “you” of being a trust and transmitting utility that is a franchise of the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico and presume that you, the Living Person, are an Acceptance Agent for this trust.  In Admiralty Court, they accuse you of being a “US vessel” and allege that you are a Member of the Merchant Marines representing that vessel.  Of course, you walk through the door thinking that you are a Living Person on the Land and an American Citizen, and get creamed by these unstated presumptions before you even open your mouth.
          Now that you know what these presumptions are and that these courts have no jurisdiction over you, the Living Person on the Land, you can prepare your answers accordingly. If you squash their attempts to corral you at the level of the statutory court, you will most likely never see the inside of an Admiralty Court, unless the judges are openly criminal and hoping you will crack under the stress of maintaining your lawful identity.  
          This is always how they prosecute IRS cases: first, the IRS sends you a “Notice of Deficiency” that is basically an unsigned affidavit alleging that you owe tons of money to the Department of the Treasury (of Puerto Rico).  The US Tax Court, a foreign statutory court that operates exclusively out of Washington, DC, also receives a copy of this Notice from the IRS.  This “Notice of Deficiency” is always addressed to you as a Living Person, using upper and lower case naming conventions.
          The bank records that the alleged “deficiency” is based upon are always accounts belonging to the “strawman”---the trust and transmitting utility owned as a franchise by the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico. 
          This circumstance invalidates their claim.
          They are addressing one person, the Living Person, as if you were in fact the corporate “person”.  They do it this way trying to establish a connection between you, the Living Person, and their corporate trust.
          If they get called on it, they can scramble back and claim that they were intentionally addressing you as the Acceptance Agent, aka, “Withholding Agent” for the trust and transmitting utility, but that’s not credible----if they intended to address you in that role, they would have included a bill and a promissory note for you to sign authorizing the discharge against the US Treasury, but they never do. They always try to brazen it out and establish a claim against the Living Person. 
          They will try to argue, if they are especially determined, that Thompkins v. Erie Railroad, places you in “general partnership” with your strawman trust, but a general partnership like any other contractual agreement requires full disclosure and knowing and willing participation.  None of this arrangement was ever fully disclosed to you.
          Either the money in those bank accounts represents your non-taxable property accrual as a Living Person, or the money represents legitimate corporate income earned by a franchise of the Department of the Treasury, and all of its debts have to be discharged against the US Treasury.  
          The IRS loses in either case.  They get no money out of you, the Living Person.
          We repeat, there are only two possibilities:  either there is no legitimate “corporate income” in evidence, only your property accruals earned in private commerce, or whatever corporate income there is, belongs to the trust and transmitting utility the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico established in your name, and any tax debt must be discharged against the US Treasury as a valid expense of the federal franchise.
          The Notice of Deficiency informs you that you may “Petition” the US Tax Court if you disagree with the IRS’s assessment.
          They make this invitation so that you stupidly file a “petition” and grant the US Tax Court jurisdiction it otherwise doesn’t have over you. 
          Instead, you file a signed Counter-Affidavit via Special Appearance.  You tell the court that you are compelled under duress to act in two capacities: (1) as a Living Person, you are not a “US citizen” and do not voluntarily submit to federal jurisdiction, are not a member of the military or the Merchant Marines and do not engage in any regulated or interstate trade, so that the US Tax Court has no jurisdiction over you. Tell them that you operate only in private commerce, and accrue only non-taxable private property. Note that the following US Supreme Court cases have long since clarified the point that private property is not subject to the income tax and includes the wages and salaries of non-citizen Nationals: Eisner v. Macomber 252 US 189 (1918), Coppage v. Kansas, 236 US 1, Staples v. United States, 21 F.Supp 737 at 739, Slaughterhouse Case, 16 Well. 36, 130; Stratton’s Independence v. Howbert, 231 US 399, Butcher’s Union Co. v Crescent City Co. 111 US 746, Adair v. United States, 208 US 161, 172, et alia.  
          Inform the US Tax Court that you do not consent to a transaction of a security interest.  They won’t believe their ears, so just keep on repeating that.
          Secondly, inform the US Tax Court that you are by Public Law 73-10 et alia enabled to act as an Acceptance Agent for a trust and transmitting utility created using your name that is a franchise of the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico.  If this trust has accrued a valid public debt, you are able to authorize discharge of the debt against the US Treasury, but the IRS hasn’t provided you with the needed paperwork to do so.  
          Spell it out for them. 
          If you get an ignorant attorney or judge they will continue to harass you.  Once it gets to their superiors who are in on the sting, the silence will be complete and deafening.  You will simply never hear from the IRS or the “US Tax Court” again.
          Until that happens, insist that they recognize you as a Living Person on the Land making a Special Appearance challenging the jurisdiction of the court and merely offering the court information and recommendations.  The rats gain nothing by dragging their own strawman trust into court.  Actually discharging the debts of the strawman trust against the US Treasury reduces the fake “National Debt” and the bank’s Trustee, the Secretary of the Treasury of Puerto Rico, doesn’t want to do that.  He wants to convince you that you, personally, owe him and the banks he works for the entire amount represented by the “National Debt”.
          Here’s the strange truth about the National Debt.
          The banks loaned you your own money.  The National Debt is owed to the American People, not the banks. The American People act as both fiduciary debtor and fiduciary creditor.  The only “debt” owed, is what you owe yourselves.  You can “forgive” yourselves any debt you want to forgive. Simply say it doesn’t have to be paid back, and the National Debt is gone.
          It is always the Living Person they are after, but as you can see now, they are caught in their own web.  The trust and transmitting utility they have created belongs to them, and the “US vessel” they have created on paper also belongs to them.  The liabilities of these “proxy” entities have no connection to the Living Person on the Land, so long as the Living Person knows that and staunchly defends their identity.
          Remember--- all statutory courts, like the US Tax Court and the State Courts, have nothing but statutory jurisdiction over corporate entities.  You are not a corporation. They have no jurisdiction over you, the Living Person.  At most, they can cause trouble for the trust and transmitting utility that is a franchise of the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico.   Likewise, the mighty court of International Admiralty, the venue always employed by US District Court, has no jurisdiction over a Living Person on the Land.
          Stand up and say so. 
          If they keep on bothering you, allow them to set a trial date.  Be patient.  Make sure that the Court Recorder is set up and taking down the proceedings and that the court is officially on the record.  When they call your name, specifically ask if the proceedings are on the record and politely refuse to answer any questions or take any actions until they confirm that yes, we are on the record.
          Then immediately look at the judge(s) and say, “I, John M. Doe, a Living Person and Beneficiary of the Trust, am appointing you, Judge Harold J. Fiddlestick, Judge Diane Finkelstein, and Judge Herbert Castaglio, my Trustees.”
          There should be a prompt draining of any color from the smug faces.
          Next, you say--- “As my Trustees, I want you to discharge any and all matters that have been accused against me, and erase the record that any such thing ever occurred.”
          They have no choice.  They are now your Trustees.  They have to act in your best interests.
          Next, you say, “I wish to be compensated and require (however many dollars) in redemption.”  This represents redemption of the court’s sins and errors against you, the Sovereign.  The money comes straight out of the court’s pocket.
          If you ask them to “establish in a new public record that I am a Living Person and not a corporation or marine vessel of any kind” they will be obligated to do that, too.
          The courts will very shortly become as depopulated as the waiting rooms of banks and lawyer’s offices. 
          You can and should do the same thing to all the fake Public Officials who are running around without any fiduciary responsibility to act in your best interest.
 
A Brief and Ugly History
          There are three commonly used legal definitions of “United States of America”.  There’s the 50 States United we always assume.  There’s another version of American “states” calling themselves by the same name----“mirroring” again----composed of “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia”, what we think of as the Territories, and there is the “US Corporation”, which is the “doing business as” corporate persona of the “District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico” version of “United States of America”.
          DC, Guam, and so on, are “states” of a kind, and they are located in the American Hemisphere, and there’s no reason they can’t form a “union”, but it does seem odd to be calling two separate entities by the same name, doesn’t it?  It’s like calling a trust and transmitting utility by your name.  
          It’s the same scam, just a different venue.
          We have to dig back in time to understand how this came about.  It’s 1861, and the Southern States have walked out on Abraham Lincoln, leaving him without a functioning Congress.  So he formed a corporation and made the remaining members of Congress from the Northern States the Board of Directors.   The “federal government” has been functioning as a glorified corporation ever since. The state of emergency allowing Lincoln to do this, and the de facto institution of martial law under Executive power, has never been rescinded.  Technically, America has been in a state of emergency and functioning under martial law for over 150 years.
          That fact and the fact that the lawful government of the 50 States was replaced by a corporate proxy government was never broadly revealed to the population at large.  Lincoln was conveniently assassinated. The real government was never reconvened.  Succeeding Presidents cherished their almost unlimited executive powers too much to give them up. 
          In 1901 two US Supreme Court cases, Downes v. Bidwell and Hooven and Allison Company v. Evatt created a new kingdom for Congress.  In the Downes decision the Court allowed Congress to administer the District of Columbia and the Territories without regard to the Constitution for the united States of America (yes, that is the right name and capitalization for the organic, original Constitution). In the second case, the Court expanded that to include all federal jurisdictions.  
          Stop a moment and take in the view.  As a result of those two US Supreme Court decisions, Congress can do anything it likes wherever it has federal jurisdiction, without any regard for the Constitution of the United States of America.  
          So, where does the federal government (Congress) have jurisdiction?  In 1901, that meant the District of Columbia and the Territories, plus it gave immediate jurisdiction over federal employees, members of the military, and “US citizens”---basically, anyone who didn’t know better and failed  to insist on being called an “American Citizen”.
          These were the founding errors serving to create the Two Kingdoms----the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia” is ruled over by Congress as an increasingly criminal oligarchy, while at the same time, Congress, which is now nothing more or less than a very large corporate Board of Directors, is obligated to abide by its public contract, the Constitution of the United States of America, in administering the affairs of the 50 States United. 
          So how did we come to this pass, where virtually every piece of legislation coming out of Congress ignores or attacks the limits and principles of the Constitution?
          Congress routinely passes legislation related to the “District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico….et alia” as if it also applied to the 50 States United, and then simply lets ignorance and presumption take over.  
          Legislation that applies only to this other version of “United States” is described as an “Act of Congress”.  Any legislation that applies to the 50 States United clearly identifies itself as an “Act of Congress” which is enacted as Public Law.
          It’s perfectly okay, according to the US Supreme Court, for the Congress to rule the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, et alia, as despots. It’s all right for Congress to own slaves, detain people indefinitely without the right to due process, engage in the drug trade, impose selective service, or do anything else it likes.
          So long as they are in “federal jurisdiction” the Congress can do any crazy, immoral, criminal thing it pleases to “US citizens”.
          The Internal Revenue Act is a good example.  It lawfully applies only to people living under federal jurisdiction, but it is presumed against everyone, and then the cutsie little bank sting and the phony corporate entity, your personal trust and transmitting utility, expedites enforcement against you.
          The IRS walks in, presents proof that you have a Social Security Number and that is their proof that you are a “US citizen”.  Then they plunk down the bank account records and what does the judge see?  DON JOHNSON is the owner of the account. It’s obviously a federal corporate entity that owns that bank account, and the money therein must be federal income that is subject to the federal income tax. 
          Most IRS agents and most of the people who work in your local bank are completely innocent and the majority of IRS agents are more to be pitied than feared. If you spend time with them and talk to them you will discover that there are two distinct kinds of IRS employee and none of them will answer a straight question to save their souls.  If you ask them to sign off on any answer they give you, a verbatim quote, they will refuse to do so. 
          If you ask them a simple, obvious question like---- “What is the definition of income?”----they will give you answers like, “Well, income, you know, all the money you take in.” 
          They don’t know the real, legal definition of “income” any more than you did when you started reading this, but just like you, they know something is wrong.  Deep down, they sense that they are involved in a criminal racket.
          There is a reason that so many Puerto Ricans work for the IRS.  The IRS works for the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico. 
          This Confusion at Law regarding which role Congress is playing and which laws apply to which version of “United States of America” has served to create an unlawful conversion of our government using the same basic bunko scheme as is used to unlawfully convert your private property into federally owned corporate income.
          Average Americans living their lives in one of the 50 States United are not obligated to obey any “Act of Congress” that does not specifically state that it is enacted as a Public Law, but these “laws” are presumed to be valid and are routinely enforced against Americans as if they were lawfully “US citizens”.
          As an example, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 is an “Act of Congress” and it does not lawfully or generally apply to the 50 States United nor to their Citizens.  The problem is that law enforcement and military commanders are as clueless about the Two Kingdoms as the American populace and will assume that they have to obey any and every Act of Congress.  A further problem is that Congress knows this and promotes the confusion to exceed its constitutional limits.  
          The final problem is that over the years the federal government has finagled ways to enable its chicanery and make claims to the effect that virtually everyone is a “US citizen” and subject to the whims of Congress.  Do you have a Social Security Number?  A trust and transmitting utility named after you?  Use the public roads and schools?  Have you ever served in the US military?  These are the means by which the federal government seeks to lay claim to you, body and soul. 
          Now that you know that the “federal government” is nothing but a corporation and has been nothing but a corporation substituting for the lawful government since 1861, you should be asking yourself:  How does a corporation get away with “taxing” me?   Sears can’t tax me …..and neither can the corporate proxies operating all the various levels of government in America.
          They just call their various membership service fees “taxes” and delude you into paying.
 
Why You Should Never Hire an Attorney
          You’ve learned why you should never hire a banker.  Now learn why you should never hire an attorney. None of these deplorable abuses would be possible if the American attorneys were acting as Americans.  This system of things wouldn’t last a week without the full help and determined support of the American Bar Association.
          The Constitution of the United States of America is a giant and hugely public commercial contract. The original organic “Constitution for the united States of America”  started out as a “compact”---an agreement by the several States to indebt themselves to pay for certain enumerated services, and so, it has always been a contract defining the structure, limits, duties, and means of paying for services to be provided by a new level of government. 
          If the Constitution ever meant anything, the lawyers should be defending it, if not out of patriotism, out of greed; but, as you have begun to suspect, the Constitution no longer means anything because the government it binds no longer exists.  The lawful federal government has been replaced by a corporate imposter for over 150 years, and that corporation has neither the rights nor the obligations of the lawful government.
          In 1933, the original government of the States was also taken over by a corporate coup d’etat, and the original Constitution that had been honored by the American States up to that point, was replaced by the commercial contract that is in evidence today “The Constitution of the United States of America” and at first glance, the two documents appear largely the same, except that the original 13th Amendment does not appear in the modern version.  The original 13th Amendment outlawed the Bar Association in America.
          As a commercial contract, the present version of the Constitution is enforceable only if you knowingly act as an Acceptance Agent and bring suit against the federal corporation under the Uniform Commercial Code as a franchise operator.
          How many Americans are prepared to do that? 
          You don’t know you’re an Acceptance Agent.  You don’t know there is a trust and transmitting utility owned as a franchise by the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico named after you.  You don’t know that your lawful government has been replaced at all levels by corporations merely “representing” it.  You don’t know that you have a “US vessel” named after you, either.  
          Here is the simple fact---- you cannot hire an attorney to represent you.
          Attorneys always represent the Crown Temple.  They never represent the people who pay them, and who mistakenly assume that because they have hired an attorney and paid him lots of money, his job is to defend them.  That is not what “your” attorney has agreed to do.  
          An attorney’s entire job is to make sure that the Judge doesn’t make an appealable error.  His job is to protect the judge.  He’s there to make sure that when you are nailed to the cross, it is done in a workman-like fashion, and you pay him for this service.
          If you don’t understand that your lawyer’s allegiance is always and only to the Court, you may well be mystified by their suggestions and behavior.
          Why are the junior attorneys always bobbing up and down like birds drinking at a fountain?  If you are watching senior attorneys perform, what are those strange hand signals about?  Why does the judge suddenly jump up from his chair, go into his chamber, and then come back out?
          You are watching an ancient ritual. Each person is performing their part, according to their level of initiation.  The young lawyers are doing obeisance, the older lawyers are calling their shots, like a game of billiards, and the judge’s little in and out of chambers dance just changed the jurisdiction of the court on you without announcing it in court.
          The attorneys practice a very strange religion in which everything is twisted around, redefined, and is upside down and backwards---a religion that mirrors everything.  Oh.  Where have we encountered that before? 
          Naming trusts and transmitting utilities after Living Persons is purely a lawyer’s trick.  Calling the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and other Insular States the “United States of America” is typical of their semantic deceits.   
          An attorney’s use of language is meant to be blasphemous, deceptive, and warped against any true or honest meaning. They have managed to record over 350 different so-called “legal meanings” of “United States of America” alone.   Black is white and up is sideways, an objection isn’t an opposition and a conditional acceptance doesn’t accept anything at all. 
          The attorneys excuse all this as “tradition” and as “legal meanings of words” but that’s claptrap to hide the obvious.  
          Attorneys are professional liars.  The Crown Temple worships the Father of All Lies.  When an attorney tells you that the practice of law is all about finding the truth, they have just told you the biggest lie in their whole kit bag.  
          Attorneys lie when they have to, and they lie when they don’t have to. They lie just for fun.  They lie to make money.  They lie for entertainment.  They lie as a blood sport.  They will happily, gleefully, lie about you, their client, but they will never lie to the judge.  That is because they are always working for the judge.
          So your lawyer isn’t your lawyer, any more than your bank account belongs to you.  The judge works for the Court, the Court works for the Crown Temple, and the Crown Temple belongs to the banks. The lawyer you hired works for the judge.  If the judge doesn’t get you, your lawyer already has.  It’s impossible for the Bar Association to lose, and equally impossible for you to win.
          At the end of the day, when the House counts the chips, the Bar Association always wins, and the only way out of this trap is to never go in. 
          When you hire an attorney to “represent” you, he is representing you in the same way that the trust and transmitting utility is “representing” you.  By hiring a lawyer you are presenting yourself to the Court as a ward of the State, literally as a person who is mentally incompetent to speak for yourself and make your own decisions.
          This is what a “General Power of Attorney” does----it grants your authority to act, to speak, to ask questions, and to make decisions, to your lawyer or to whomever else you grant a General Power of Attorney to. You become bound by their words and deeds. Most of them make a show of asking your permission, but the deal is already cut. Nine times out of ten, there isn’t the least little bit of a question about the outcome when you step into the courtroom with a lawyer by your side, because the lawyer you hired has already signed off on the deal “for” you, and you gave him permission to do this by hiring him. 
          So you have handed your keys to a perfect stranger who works for the judge who works for the court which works for the Crown Temple which works for the banks, and the banks are, as it turns out, the ones prosecuting you.  You might as well strip naked and lay down on the nearest Teller’s Counter.
 
The Great Fraud
          Our historical thread broke off with the Hooven and Allison Company v. Evatt decision by the US Supreme Court in 1901:  next, in 1913, a group of extremely wealthy and mostly European bankers got together and conspired to create a Central Bank in America.  The Federal Reserve was born.  The story about this is recorded in The Creature from Jekyll Island, which is highly recommended reading, but not for the faint of heart or mind.   
          The Federal Reserve was founded to undermine the value of the American currency, just as the 14th Amendment had to be passed first to undermine the guarantees of your natural citizenship. The pieces were being put in place for the greatest and longest-running fraud in history.
          In 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt came to power, and the bankers were ready for the coup d’etat they had been planning for decades prior.  They bankrupted the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia, with ease, and then Roosevelt went whining to the Governors of the 50 States United, telling them ---the United States of America is bankrupt!
          FDR didn’t bother to explain which “United States of America” was bankrupt. Most of the State Governors acting at that time assumed that the bankrupt entity was the 50 States United.  They didn’t know about the existence of the other version of the “United States of America” that was concocted during Theodore Roosevelt’s Administration, but FDR knew. 
          Like any high class con artist, FDR didn’t exactly lie.  He didn’t exactly tell the truth, either. 
          The federal government had been functioning as a corporation since 1861 but the States had all retained their individual sovereignty and were continuing to function as legitimate State governments.  That had to be overcome.
          So Roosevelt appealed under false pretenses to the Conference of Governors and on March 6, 1933, the Conference of Governors replied by generously coming to the assistance of the  “United States of America” aka the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico,  et alia,  by “pledging” the “full faith and credit” of their States and the “citizenry” thereof.  (See:  Pages 18 - 24 of The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin Roosevelt, Volume II, The Year Of Crisis, March 6, 1933).
          This is exactly what the bankers wanted.
          As a result of the Governor’s actions, the 50 States United and “the citizenry thereof” were entered as “adjuncts” to the bankruptcy proceedings---- which are still ongoing nearly eight decades later.  By agreeing to stand good for a bankrupt entity, the Governors laid the States and the private wealth of the People on the table as surety for the debts of the federal corporation.  Instead of simply settling the bankruptcy, the politicians used it as carte blanche for unlimited credit with the banks.
          Who is owed the vast bulk of that National Debt?  You are.   That money is owed to you.  The banks loaned you your own money. 
          Ever known a furniture store that has a “Going Out of Business Sale!” every three years, yet plainly, remains in the same or nearby location selling furniture for thirty years more? The name might change, but it’s the same store, selling the same merchandise.  They are doing the same thing that the government did in 1933. 
          They “split assets”.  The named furniture store that you think you are doing business with is just a corporate fiction.  It doesn’t actually own the furniture you are buying.  Other entities own the vast bulk of the assets. The bankrupted entity that is going out of business is just a “corporate proxy” with few assets of its own to lose, and the majority of the debt accrued. 
          When this corporate proxy goes “bankrupt” the bankruptcy process wipes away the legitimate debts, and all that has really been lost to the owners and operators is whatever small amount of capital assets they have assigned to the bankrupt entity to “validate” the bankruptcy. 
          They sacrifice the trivial assets to off-load the debt, retain the “majority assets” under different ownership, and reboot their business.
          The corporation functioning as the “federal government” in 1933 did the exact inverse of this --- instead of sacrificing the small holdings---DC, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia, they used the small holdings to draw the entire nation into a giant “bankruptcy” that even one of the 50 States could have paid off.  Why? 
          This was done “backwards” so that the banks and the “United States of America” represented by DC, Puerto Rico, Guam, et alia,  could become the majority asset owners instead of you.  Bit by bit, using the fraudulent bankruptcy as their mechanism, the banks have accumulated a phony “debt” held against the American People.  They used the American’s money, their dollars, to create this debt.
          Working together with the Crown Temple lawyers, they have endeavored to hide the fact that the real creditors owed the “National Debt” are the American People, and that the real debtor is the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam….et alia”, by interposing the banks as intermediaries claiming to be owed the National Debt.  
          The banks are again usurping your own identity to enrich themselves.  The “United States of America” ran up all these debts on your credit card without your knowledge or permission, and now the banks are claiming that you owe them a ton of money. 
          But wait, whose money was borrowed?  Yours.
          Not the bank’s. 
          You are both the fiduciary creditor and the fiduciary debtor.  The banks “loaned” you your own money and they are now pretending that they are owed that entire amount, plus interest, as the National Debt.
          The only ones benefitting from the so-called “national bankruptcy” are the banks using it to make a false claim of indebtedness against the American People.  They are attempting yet another unlawful conversion of real property, seeking to convert the majority assets of the American People, into the majority assets of the banks.  
          Can a Governor of a State in 1933, or now, really pledge anything on your personal behalf?  No.   Your Governor can’t enter you into a bankruptcy.  He can’t exercise your private credit to buy himself a new Lexus.  The Governors back in 1933 had no granted authority to “pledge” your “full faith and credit”, and they had no material interest to back their claims. They simply did it, and the banks, who were “representing you” as Creditors, accepted.
          The People, of course, weren’t told about any of this.
          The banks and the politicians created a gigantic unlawful conversion, claiming that all the private property in America was in fact a public corporate asset.  Does this sound familiar?  It should. 
          It’s the same scam they use to convert your non-taxable private property into taxable federal income, only this time, instead of a “strawman” trust and transmitting utility acting as a corporate proxy representing “you” the Living Person, the banks are acting as corporate proxies representing “you”, the American People.      
          On May 23, 1933, a lone US Congressman, Louis T. McFadden, brought formal charges against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank system, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Secretary of the United States Treasury for numerous criminal acts, including but not limited to: conspiracy, fraud, unlawful conversion, and treason.  The petition for Articles of Impeachment was thereafter referred to the Judiciary Committee, and has yet to be acted upon.  (See: the Congressional Record, May 23, 1933, pp.  4055-4058.)
          In 1938, the whole of America was bankrupted by design and by fraud.  The creditors, (foreign powers) seized ownership of the flag, State governments, their laws and constitutions, including every last comma and period, the whole country and its citizens.  These acts of fraud and treason placed Americans in peonage. 
          The 1937 Edition of the Book of the States openly declared that the people engaged in such activities as the Farming/Agro Related Industry had already been reduced to mere feudal ";Tenants"; on their Land, see the Book of The States, Book II, Volume II, 1937, p 155.  This is precisely the meaning of all “Deeds of Trust” presently offered by the “government” on all property naturally possessed by allodium----yet another devastating fraud practiced against the Americans. 
          The reorganization that took place under this bankruptcy and which is functioning to date, is recorded as Title 5 of the Federal Code. 
          So let’s recount.  Your entire country has been embroiled in a fraudulent bankruptcy for eight decades, every scrap of land, water, oil, food, and everything else that the States or the People own has been purportedly mortgaged to the hilt to international banks who have been loaning you your own money and charging you interest for the “service”.
          This has been done “on your behalf” without your knowledge, without your consent, (for most Americans) before you were born, by people who were not acting under any valid granted authority whatsoever.
          You and your country have both been defrauded on a huge scale by international banks pretending to represent you and by corporations masquerading as your legitimate government, and they have done this by pretending to represent you. 
          Neither the banks “substituting” for you as the Creditor owed the National Debt on one hand, nor the phony corporation “substituting” for your legitimate government on the other, care a rat’s rump about you.  You are only necessary as the “excuse” for their existence and the source of their sustenance.
          The banks and the corporations masquerading as your real government care about you the way a tapeworm cares about its host.
          These same banks standing in your stead as the “Creditors” owed the National Debt, also literally own and control the Crown Temple, the worldwide control center of the Bar Association, the organization you have entrusted to educate your judges and rule over your attorneys.  
          Thanks to you, Dear Victim, and the disappearance of the 13th Amendment to the original Constitution, your attorneys can’t do anything but what the British-controlled Bar Association recommends, or they will lose their licenses to practice law. 
          So, in the end, which entity stands to benefit from all this deceit and fraud?  Why, the  “United States of America”-----a Commonwealth nation with its headquarters in the State of New Columbia, aka, the District of Columbia.  The name change has already been made.
          The original, legitimate States of the Union are still embroiled in this fraudulently imposed bankruptcy.  So what happened ----again?   Just as in 1861, in 1933 corporations were formed to substitute for the legitimate government.
          Thus, the State of Wisconsin is being “represented by” the “State of Wisconsin, Incorporated.” 
          The “State of Wisconsin” is a living, organic entity comprised of land and waters, the flesh and blood of a geographically defined “state”.  The “State of Wisconsin, Inc.” is a piece of paper, a dead legal fiction, the equivalent of a trust and transmitting utility, established “in the name of” the real State.
          All fifty of the corporations that are masquerading as the real States are Municipal franchises of the “US Corporation”.  Just like McDonald’s. 
          As corporations they are merely “persons” before the law, like any other person.  The so-called federal government, defined as a corporation, has and can exercise no sovereignty, and neither can its franchises.  The de jure States are embroiled in a fraudulently-imposed national bankruptcy and are considered wards of the Court, so they cannot exercise any sovereignty, either.  
          “America” hasn’t functioned as a sovereign nation of any stripe since 1861 and none of the States have functioned as sovereign states since 1933.  
          There remained one final card to be played, and in 1940, the Congress played it: the Buck Act.   The Buck Act is another conversion.  It made “US citizens” the property of the federal corporation.  It literally defined “US citizens” as “franchises” of the federal government----that is, slaves.  This brings it all full circle. 
          What started out as a fruitful means of transferring the privately owned black slaves to the public ownership of the US Government via “US citizenship” became the means of literally enslaving the entire American populace.  
          The corporation masquerading as the legitimate federal government could now enforce Selective Service requirements and had unlimited credit with the banks; the banks were now in a position to wield the “natural and human resources” of America to profit themselves. 
          For the past eight decades, that is precisely what they have been doing, like pigs at a trough.  The bankers have been using American blood to fight wars in their behalf, and have then charged the Americans for the privilege of doing so.  They have started the wars, mostly over oil fields and rubber and similar resources, sold arms to both sides, and have profited both in the means and in the results. 
          As rich as the rest of the world assumed that the Americans were, judging by the way Congress spent money and carried on wars of aggression, at a certain point, the illusion began to wear thin.  People in China and Saudi Arabia and other points of the globe smelled a rat. Something wasn’t right. The Americans weren’t acting like Americans.  They were acting like cheap hoodlums, running drugs and guns and alcohol, dealing in slaves, bullying everyone, and not paying their debts. Washington, DC, ceased to be a respectable capitol, and began to resemble a Roman bathhouse instead.
          Had the character of the American People degenerated to that extent and so quickly, too?  No.  The Americans were just as honest and hard-working and kind as they had ever been, but the corporation “representing” them is a criminal enterprise, based on fraud.  Like all criminal enterprises it is violent, immoral, and bound to fail.
 
The Wreck
          The present version of “US Corporation” is ostensibly on life support, already technically bankrupt, and its franchises, the corporate States, are on average not in much better shape if all you look at are the public budgets.
          As you should expect by now, public accounting practices are just as dishonest and upside down as everything else in the make-believe Wizard of Oz world created by the bankers and lawyers.
          In 1946, the federal government imposed a new system of public accounting. It happened to be the same accounting system used by Al Capone against the IRS. The federal corporation and its state franchises began keeping two sets of books, the “budgeted” money and the “off book” or “non-budgeted” money. 
          The government at all levels fails to report its total income to the People.
          All the American People ever see or talk about is the “Budget”, and they innocently assume that the government budgets money the same way that they budget their meager salaries.
          Not so.
          Let’s pretend that you take in $200,000 per year as your salary, and then, let’s pretend that you are a miser, and you choose to live on only $20,000 per year.  During the course of the year you wind up spending $25,000, so from the perspective of your budget, you have a $5,000 budget deficit to cry about. Just forget about the $175,000 invested in South African gold mines.
          That’s precisely what every unit of government, from the local School Board to federal government, has been doing since 1946.
          Once per year there is a giant national accounting that takes place to keep the banks happy.  The corporate federal government requires its franchises, the incorporated States, to produce a “Comprehensive Annual Financial Report”.  It requires all the subfunds of the States and the lesser units of government, which are in turn corporate subsidiaries of the States, to produce an “Annual Financial Report”.
          This is to keep the corporate States honest and up to date---at least with respect to their own tithe-paying to the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury (of Puerto Rico), and to prove their stewardship of the federal corporation’s assets---you, me, everything we own, and all the land and water and natural resources of our respective States.
          If you get a copy of the State of California, Inc. “Comprehensive Annual Financial Report” as opposed to their corporate “Budget” you will discover an amazing thing.  The State of California, Inc. is incredibly wealthy. The income coming in from just one of its many major investment funds is sufficient to pay off every expense of the entire University of California system.  The corporate State of California is so very far from being “broke” that it is laughable, and people should laugh every time they hear about any of these franchises being “broke”. 
          All such claims are merely poor-mouthing by the bankers, who want all the money and income for themselves and so, use every excuse possible to drain more money out of you and practice yet another conversion.  They take your private property, run it through the trust and transmitting utility’s bank account to make it into “corporate income” for the purposes of the federal income tax, and then, they tag along and the California Franchise Tax Board takes another cut of it.
          Apparently, nobody asks---“Franchise of what?”
          The State of California, Inc. has learned its lessons from Big Brother, and is applying the same Cider House Rules against the People. 
          Remember the Buck Act that makes all “US citizens” franchises of the federal government?  In California, all “citizens of California” are ALSO deemed to be “franchises” of the State of California, Inc.
          It’s very important to remember that none of these corporations belong to you. You belong to them. You are literally a slave, a “human resource” for them.  The banks own these corporations, and the banks have uniformly converted every scrap of private property that they can extract from the People without causing mass hysteria into “income” for these corporations, that is, themselves.  On top of outright stealing ownership of your private property, they tax you for the privilege of giving them your money, your house, your car, your land, your very body.
 
The Gold Confiscation
          One of the very first acts of the banks acting as Creditors in the 1933 bankruptcy was to seize all privately held American gold.  There are still plenty of old-timers around who can remember the public announcements and the IRS agents coming around, collecting wedding rings and amulets and coins.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued four Executive Orders declaring “gold hoarding” to be a crime at a felony level. (See Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111 and 6260). Never mind that he and his banker cronies were obviously in the business of hoarding gold.
          To be fair, the corporate government didn’t keep that gold.  The Secretary of the Treasury (of Puerto Rico) shipped it all off to the Creditors, the foreign, privately owned banks. There isn’t even the trace of gold dust left in Fort Knox and there hasn’t been for eight decades.  There was just one little problem.
          The corporation posing as our legitimate government couldn’t explain away such obvious theft of private property very easily.  That would have involved admitting the whole bankruptcy scam.  To keep a lid on their nefarious activities and expedite the conversion of the monetary system to something backed only by paper and promises, Congress offered the Accepted for Value program, to “make things up” to those constituents who had lost enough gold and had enough savvy to cause trouble.
          The trust and transmitting utility that was created using your name is called your “Strawman”.  Not only does your Strawman own all your assets and owe all your debts, your Strawman is owed money by the US Treasury as a direct result of all the gold the government collected from your grandmothers and grandfathers. 
          Since you don’t know that your Strawman exists or what it is or how it works or how it came into being, it’s obvious that you can’t discharge any of “his” debts against the US Treasury and you can’t collect on that debt for him.  The phony government corporation gets all the cream, you get all the chicken bones at the bottom of the slop bucket.
          If you don’t know who you really are and how your Strawman trust and transmitting utility functions, you are in no position to defend yourself from these usurping predatory banks and corporations.  You can’t force them to pay for all the Strawman’s debts or collect on the money the corporate government owes “him”. You are just another hapless creditor, aka, victim, among the billions of other people to whom the “US Government” owes money. 
          Here’s the take home point---again----- the vast majority of the money represented by the “National Debt” is money that the corporation that has been “representing” your lawful government owes to you and the rest of the American People.  The banks have acted as middlemen converting the wealth of the nation into the purported ownership of foreign corporations, just as they act as middle men to convert your private property into “federal income”.  
          The wealth of the State of Wisconsin, for example, has been surreptitiously transferred to the State of Wisconsin, Inc. via unlawful conversion in precisely the same manner that your personal non-taxable property has been unlawfully converted to the ownership of a trust and transmitting utility that is a franchise of the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico.
 
Light Comes Forth
          Kilroy is in deep, deep corporate Kim-Chee.  He’s a slave.  A federal trust and transmitting utility owns all his real property on earth.  Another corporation called the “Department of the Treasury” owns the trust and transmitting utility, and the banks own the “Department of the Treasury” (of Puerto Rico).  They also own every judge and lawyer in town.  They’ve worked their fraud scheme to the point where they claim to own everything, every blade of grass and every school child in America.
          Having come face to face with the monster now, doesn’t it seem hopeless?  What chance do you have?  What ray of hope is there?
          All of this was done by fraud and semantic deceits, and fraud vitiates everything it touches.  In the world of international commerce, any contract tainted by fraud is instantly and from its beginning, null and void.  You can stand on your own two feet and shout, “I’ve been defrauded! My country has been defrauded!”-----but who will hear you?
          The judge who gets his paycheck from the corporation, and takes his orders from the Bar Association, which is an agency of the Crown Temple, owned lock, stock, and barrel by the banks that have defrauded you?  He cannot and will not defend you until the coals of Hell are under his feet, unless, of course, you name him as your personal trustee.
          How about armed insurrection?  All you do is wind up killing other innocent Americans who are still deluded, still believing that this “thing” that “represents” their government, is their government.  Are you going to gun down your neighbor’s child, or is he going to gun you down, for the sake of a corporate entity that has defrauded both of you?  
          No.  The corporation would like that, but no.  We, the People, aren’t going in that direction.  Americans aren’t getting mad.  Americans are getting even. 
          Day by day, they are reclaiming their proper heritage and identity. They are peacefully repopulating the American Republic.
          Remember what happened way back in 1861?  Congress stopped functioning as a legitimate government and was reduced to a substitute corporate entity.  The original government wasn’t destroyed.  It was just set aside, left lying on a table to gather dust while the Civil War ---more rightly known as the War of Secession----raged. There it remained, forgotten, for a hundred and fifty years: the de jure, rightful, lawful Constitutional government of America, has still existed.  It simply hasn’t been “inhabited”.  It has been “depopulated”.
          How?
          The rightful American Citizens have been arbitrarily redefined as “US citizens”.
          The first step toward home is to click your heels together three times and say, “I am a non-citizen National.  I am not a “US citizen”.  I was defrauded of my birthright status, and I hereby reclaim it in full.  All agreements and signatures by my hand seeming to agree otherwise are null and void ab initio, nunc pro tunc.”
          Title this simple statement “Affidavit of Political Status” and get it notarized and file it with your County Clerk or Recorder’s Office.  Ask them for a Certified Copy of the filed document, and send copies of it via Certified US Mail to every alphabet soup agency of government that you may have reason to deal with.  Make sure that you give adequate Public Notice to the federal and state officials and agencies, most especially the IRS.  Save all your mailing receipts so you can prove it.
          You’ve just shoved your fist down the Monster’s throat and hit them where they live. You’ve taken back who you really are, and now you can contemplate your next steps. 
          You may close your bank account, or just leave it with a small deposit so you can cash checks.  If the IRS comes after you, you know now what to say--- (1) those bank deposits represent private property, which is non-taxable and (2) if it really is “corporate income” belonging to a Strawman trust using my name, I am an Acceptance Agent and need to discharge that debt against the US Treasury.

          The IRS is completely bollixed either way.
A Tale of Two Trusts
          The real owner of America is the Vatican.  Most of us have no concept of how old the world is, but those in positions of long term leadership and power do.  Some of the oldest laws and agreements still in effect date to the year 432 A.D.  The accord signed by King John in 1213 A.D. with the Vatican is relatively recent, compared to that benchmark, and King Henry VIII notwithstanding, England is still owned by the Vatican.   All British Monarchs have been similarly and contractually bound to Rome, obligated to act as Royal Stewards in the temporal realm, vouchsafed by the Popes, who have claimed for centuries to be Vicars of Christ and Stewards of Christ holding dominion over the whole earth.
          The idea was (and is) that as God created the earth, the earth belongs to God.  Furthermore, according to ancient Christian doctrine, God gave all things on earth to His Son, Jesus.  The Popes of the Roman Catholic Church claim to be the representatives of Christ on earth, and stewards over the earth in His absence. Thus, the Church laid claim to everything, land, sea, man, and beast, and the Popes then delegated caretaking responsibility to their representatives, the Kings and Queens and other potentates of Europe and other places. 
          When the British King claimed land in America, he claimed it for the Vatican.
          Much of the blood and the misery of the past 2,000 years stems directly from the Church of Rome making these ownership claims via the activities of its monarchies over several centuries.  Catholics worldwide must come to terms with the fact that within their beloved Mother Church is another institution that mirrors the Church, just like the federal corporation mirrors the legitimate government of America.  For every Saint there is a Satanist in the heart of the Church.
          It’s true that the American Revolution was quite a jolt to this Ancient Regime of the Church and the Monarchs that serve the Church, but far from a death blow.  It was more like a minor inconvenience. 
          The Americans, though Christian, were Protestant, and they had a radically different take on the source of earthly sovereignty.  They read Genesis 1:26-28, and they realized that God granted the Dominion over the earth to all people, equally.  The earth belongs to all of us, the creatures of the dust.  That grant of land and sea and tree was meant to be shared equally, such that every man and woman is a steward of the earth and equal to any Pope or King.
          The concept of equality is a death-knell alike for the Papacy and the Monarchies.
          Thus there are, and within any living memory have always been, two completely different concepts of sovereignty operating at the same time in America: that of the Papists who honor the Pope’s claim to be the Steward of Christ, and that of the Protestants who honor the Old Testament grant of Dominion.
          The Communists, who don’t believe in God at all and who have long declared to be Atheists, are more aligned philosophically with the Protestants than the Catholics, which has meant that the Catholics and those allied with them, including the British, naturally seek to create enmity between the Communists and the Protestants.   
          If the two groups supporting the concept of human equality stop fighting each other long enough, they will most likely turn on their common enemy, the Papacy and the Monarchies that support the Papacy.  It is therefore politically expedient for Rome and for its agents in London to create hatred between the Americans and the Communists. Doing this keeps their own natural enemies at each other’s throats instead of marching into St. Peter’s Square.  
          They have been quite successful in maintaining this hatred between the Americans and the Communists, but it is beginning to wear thin, and the Americans commercial ventures with the Chinese are extremely worrisome.
          It is because of this underlying argument about the nature and source of sovereignty that the Protestant nations are forever at war---whether they know it or not---with the Vatican and the Monarchies.  It cannot be otherwise. We cannot at one and the same time declare the equal dominion of all people, and bow to a king or a pope, so there’s the rub.
          Here is how it was stated by the Vatican and the British King in the Treaty of Verona signed in 1822----Article I---basically states that the “high contracting powers” agree and decree that all those representative forms of government and governments that recognize the individual sovereignty of ordinary people, is incompatible with “divine right” and all agree to use all of their efforts to bring an end to such governments, wherever they may be found or exist.
          That means you, America. 
          The Brits have been sworn to undermine and use and abuse and destroy America since its founding, because the British Kings, despite their protestations otherwise, are Electors of the Holy See, and have been for 800 years.   Their own claim to being Kings depends on the Vatican’s support and upon the idea of Divine Right to Rule. 
          How stupid have the Americans been, to ever mistake the Vatican or the British Monarch as friends of a Protestant government? 
          As the Treaty of Paris (the agreement signed ending the American Revolution) makes clear, the King and the Vatican retained all their property and all their claims of indebtedness.  They still owned everything they had ever owned in America after the Revolution, and actually, quite a bit more, because the Americans had racked up debts to France and France at that time was claimed by England and was in debt to the Vatican.   
          Only the people of America—the Living Persons--- were freed and enabled to enjoy a version of self-rule to the extent that they could elect their own Trustees.
          Trustees?
          The idea of trusts and trustees is part and parcel of the public stewardship concept promoted by the Vatican and its allies, including the Kings and Queens of England.  The King of England and the Vatican placed their holdings in North America into a trust, administered by elected trustees, for the benefit of the Americans who were still loyal British subjects---the Tories, in other words. This was the First Trust, and it was a clever means of undermining any real self-rule in America.
          This was a land trust, and the Vatican and the British King were the donors placing their property into a Trust.  The elected public officials were the Trustees administering this Public Trust.  The American People were the beneficiaries.  That is what is meant in one sense by “Public Trust”----it’s referring to the fiduciary obligation of the Trustees, the elected officials, to manage the actual properties held in the Trust so as to benefit the beneficiaries.
          Are you a Tory?  Do you feel benefited yet?
          The trustees in Britain are hereditary rulers, and in America, they largely are, too. In recent years there has been much public disclosure by genealogists who have discovered the close familial ties of major politicians in America.  President after President is related within three or four marriages with another President. This isn’t an accident and it isn’t a result of happenstance.
          As long as the Beneficiaries remain ignorant of the fact that they are Beneficiaries, the Trustees can do whatever they like.
          There are rules, but if you don’t know the game, you can’t play it.
          The Trustees have very harsh and demanding fiduciary obligations under Roman Ecclesiastical Law, but if you don’t appoint an individual politician or public official as your Trustee, even though they have been elected and appear to inhabit a Public Office, they have no obligation to act as your Trustee, because there is not a single legitimate Public Office left in America and so, Oaths of Office mean nothing.  
          All offices that appear to be public offices in America---Governor, Mayor, President, Judge----are merely private corporate offices, and these corporations masquerading as your legitimate government belong to the “Higher Contracting Powers”.   
          There is, therefore, a vital and necessary element missing from the current situation ---the binding down of the Trustees. 
          In a real government, the appointment to Public Office is as a Trustee, which then holds the politicians responsible for their acts. The elected trustees take a valid Oath of Office and if they then fail to act as Prudent Men and in the Public Good, they can not only be kicked out of office, but thrown in jail and fined. If their acts are egregious enough, they can be charged with treason and hung. 
          Without a real government and real Public Offices there are no attendant responsibilities imposed on the politicians. 
          Look up the Oath of Office that your members of Congress take.  You will notice that they take their Oath to the Constitution of the United States, which if you are not thinking clearly and precisely, sounds like they are taking their oath properly to “the” Constitution. 
          But look again.  The “Constitution of the United States” that they are swearing an allegiance to is not the same as the “Constitution of the United States of America”.  These are two different documents, clearly stated, right in front of your nose, and your elected officials are taking their oath to an unknown private corporate version of a “Constitution” of some sort and an equally unknown “United States”. 
          Mirroring, again.
          For all you know, they are swearing an oath to a “union” of Russia, Zimbabwe, and Ireland, and calling it the “United States”.   These other nations are “states” in the same sense that “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico….et alia” are “states”.   They can form a “union”.  They can write up a document called a “constitution” just as well as they can write up a laundry list.  Our friends, the attorneys, all members of the British-based Bar Association, have been at it again, and not in the best interests of the Beneficiaries.
          No national government has existed in America since 1861and no state government has functioned for almost 80 years.  There are no Public Offices.  There are no Governors.  There is no President.  These are all merely officers of corporations owned by banks masquerading as and substituting for the legitimate American government.  They cannot take a legitimate Oath of Office. 
          As a result, the only way that these people can be bound to the fiduciary responsibilities of a Trustee, is if you individually bind them and do it in Public Record.  This normally requires their presence in a court of law, or by adequate Public Notice, such as sending Letters of Appointment via Registered Mail and having the appointment witnessed by three sworn Witnesses, and then having the text of the whole thing published in the newspaper three times.
          If you, as a Living Person, appoint Barack Hussein Obama, the Living Person, as your Trustee, he suddenly and personally becomes obligated to act strictly for your benefit.  As a Trustee, he cannot offer to indebt you, enslave you, or do you other mischief without being immediately subject to severe punishments.
          The Members of Congress have somewhat managed to evade their culpability by claiming to be members of a foreign government owed diplomatic immunity.
          You can, however, name any Living Person your Trustee, and they are then obligated to act in your best interests, so it doesn’t really matter if they are from Kenya or Hawaii, or if they are the President of a nation or the President of a corporation.  
          It is extremely counter-intuitive to name criminals as your Trustees, but if you want to hold their feet to the fire, that is exactly what you must do.  The words to bind them are:  “I, John M. Doe, the Living Person, am a Beneficiary of the Trust, and I am appointing the Living Person Barack Hussein Obama, my Trustee.”
          Fill in the blank with the names of your purported Governor, Mayor, or whomever. You can name as many Trustees as you wish.  Name the entire list of Federal Marshalls and the Joint Chiefs. If they do anything to harm you, they’ll be fried, toasted, battered, and baked by the same system they use to enslave you.  
          The attorneys who are currently holding public offices will resign en masse rather than be bound as trustees, and everyone in America will be better off.  Those “Public Officials” who remain will suddenly be very obliging and attentive and public spirited----or else the Beneficiaries won’t be happy and will not hesitate to have their trustees thrown in jail. 
          Why?  Once these people have a fiduciary responsibility to act in your best interests, they are in deep international legal waters if they do anything at all contrary to your good health and wealth.  They become personally culpable. 
          Prior to naming them as a Trustee they have been holding what appears to be a Public Office  and are exercising the powers of Public Office with no strings attached, thanks to the fact that they are not really Public Officials and have taken no valid oaths.  Once you name the Living Persons as Trustees and make them responsible for their actions, it’s a different story.  They become directly and personally accountable to you.
          It was Roman Ecclesiastical Law that got us into this mess and it is Roman Ecclesiastical Law that can get us out.   As a thing is bound, so it can be unbound. 
          Here, America, is an inexpensive answer to your Gordian Knot.  Millions of people need to make use of their computer printer and give their local newspapers a bit of business.  
          For less than a few hundred dollars apiece, you can seize control of those who control your government. 
          To go on, that was the First Trust, and you still see references to it, mostly in the names of banks, like First National Bank of Kansas City.
          Only the bankers, lawyers, Jesuits, and corrupt politicians insist upon being recognized as Living Persons and Beneficiaries of this trust, most commonly called, The Trust.  The rest of the Poor Orphans call it the “Tory Trust”. 
          There is another trust which is a mirror image of the First Trust, which was created by the 14th Amendment to the private corporation’s “constitution”.  Unlike the First Trust which was and is a land grant trust, the Public Charitable Trust created by the 14th Amendment is a cestui qui trust. 
          The beneficiaries of the First Trust are all Living Persons.  The beneficiaries of the mirroring cestui qui trust are all corporate entities.
          The Public Charitable Trust was ostensibly a do-gooder trust established to take care of all the disoriented freed black slaves left adrift after the Civil War in America, and to benefit “citizens of the United States”.  It is not Public, not Charitable, and not a true Trust.
          We’ve visited this ruse before.
          “US citizenship” was always a membership, as in Health Spa membership, calling itself a “citizenship”.  There are no real “citizens” without a real government.  Instead, the federal corporation masquerading as a government conferred a membership on the freed black slaves who couldn’t qualify to be Natural-born State Citizens and called it “US citizenship”.   Such “citizenship” conferred only “civil rights” which were also conferred and guaranteed by the corporation that was already then substituting for the real federal government.
          Just as “US citizenship” mirrored “State Citizenship”, and just as “civil rights” mirrored “Natural and unalienable Rights”, the 14th Amendment Public Charitable Trust mirrored The Trust.  This practice of mirroring everything and everyone has been part and parcel of the entire fraud practiced against Americans at every level.
          The Public Charitable Trust is a poor, miserable, stinking shadow of the real trust that Americans are heir to, exactly what you would expect of a trust created for slaves.  Eventually, of course, the Masters contrived to make the slaves pay even for their own “trust expenses”. 
          Remember how the government had to be able to claim that they gave you “equitable consideration” when you “agreed” to give up your land, home, labor, and body to their ownership?  That “equitable consideration” was comprised of all the benefits you supposedly receive from the Public Charitable Trust---all of which you in fact pay for.  And, you pay top dollar for very shoddy benefits, on top of it.
          In living memory, there has been no “equitable consideration” of any kind paid by the corporate government in exchange for its laying claim upon you, your labor, your money, your land, and every worldly possession.  You have funded any benefit you have ever received, and have provided for the benefits of all the other slaves, too. 
          Your so-called income tax payments go, in part, to pay for very hefty Life Insurance Policies owned by the International Monetary Fund, which holds your Birth Certificate as a monetized security.  When you pay your “income taxes” they are collected and returned (minus a slice of the action) by the Federal Reserve Banks to the IMF.  Since you are paying for this Life Insurance Policy and the IMF signs itself as your beneficiary, they simply “tax” you to pay for a six or seven million dollar Life Insurance Policy to benefit the bank when you die.
          The massive die-off (and equally massive monetary rewards anticipated by the IMF) that will occur when the Baby Boomer generation leaves the stage isn’t happening as fast as the IMF and Federal Reserve thought it would.
          The bankers are getting pinched.
          The Baby Boomers are living too long, far longer than their predecessors, and medical costs have skyrocketed.  That’s putting a crimp in things.   Instead of being productive and paying large amounts of taxes into the system, the oldsters are lining up by the millions to collect on their Social Security insurance benefits.
          Meager as these payouts are, the bankers are restive.  It’s true that the Americans provided more than enough money in taxes to pay for their Social Security benefits several times over.  It’s true that their money was invested at a vast profit to the banks, but this little miscalculation in average life expectancy and the increased costs of medical care are eating into the banker’s profit margin.
          This is why the politicians are suddenly so very concerned about healthcare and trying to create yet another tax so that the slaves are obligated to pay the difference.  Obamacare doesn’t have a thing to do with social justice or health care. It has to do with preserving the profit margins of the banks at the expense of the slaves.
          Short of lining up old people in front of trenches, which everyone would recognize as genocide, the bankers and the politicians who serve them are casting about for something to base a nice war on.  Wars have always been profitable in the past, and effective in killing Americans and other highly insured persons.  
          It’s actually more profitable for the banks to kill young people, so wars are always popular.
          Just as with any Life Insurance Policy you might buy, the pay off amount is the pay off amount whether you die when you are 20 or 90.  Killing an American at 20 saves the banks the bother of collecting their taxes for forty years and provides instant financial gratification they otherwise have to wait for.
          Look at the Germans in both the First and Second World Wars.  The busy, industrious, socially responsible Germans had faithfully paid their state-sponsored Life Insurance policies to the hilt, only to have the bankers kill them off by the millions---to collect on those Life Insurance policies.  
          The same scenario is building up again, only this time, the main targets are Americans.
          As long as the banks are allowed to exist in their present form, allowed to buy Life Insurance policies on their victims with their victim’s own “tax” money, there will be motivation for the banks to murder millions of innocent people. 
          Instead, millions of innocent people need to wake up and kill the banks. 
          The Communists are philosophically the natural allies of the equality-minded Americans, and they figured out what the banks were doing a long time ago.  Thanks to efforts by Russia, China, and non-aligned nations, nobody is taking the banker’s bait.  The only ones trying to start World War III are, predictably enough, the American politicians and the bankers who own them.
          It’s a cycle.  The banks are motivated to create death and destruction because it results in more money for them. Around and around it goes.
          Like an evil spouse putting a massive secret Life Insurance policy on his wife, and then killing her off so that he can collect the money and run away with his Mistress, the IMF wants World War III, so it can collect on the Americans.  If the old people won’t die off on schedule, they figure the young people must.
          Americans are alarmed, and they should be.  They have seen the FEMA Camps.  They have seen the war preparations, the Executive Orders being prepared by Barack Obama, and the Chem Trails in their skies.  Like the livestock milling around in front of the slaughterhouse, they know something is terribly wrong.
          Now you know what the problem is.
          The banks.
          Americans should not hesitate a moment.  They should tear down every bank they see.  They should build their memorials to their dead loved ones and their ruined lands with the bricks and stone culled from the bank buildings.
          Wherever a franchise stands, of any of these foreign and evil institutions, the Americans should tear it down. 
          Money, corporations, states, trusts, ---- these things are unreal. They are lies.  They are all fictions, beginning to end and front to back.  Just as your “strawman” trust and transmitting utility isn’t you, that paper in your pocket isn’t money, that man on the television isn’t your President.
          Contrary to what you’ve been taught to believe all your life, Great Britain and the Vatican are not friends of America and never have been.  They are mortal enemies that have been instrumental in the deaths and misery and impoverishment of millions of Americans and Germans, Poles, Russians, and Slavs.  
          They are mortal enemies because they do not and cannot believe in the basic equality of all men and still claim Divine Right to Rule.
          The two trusts that mirror each other belong respectively to the Tories who still support the King of England, much as they ever did, and to the Americans, who believe in equality and wind up financing the motivation for their own murders.
 
The Problem of Money and Christ
          Jesus Christ, the Son of Man, opened His arms to anyone who would obey His Father and give allegiance to the Kingdom of Heaven.  He lived and died a simple life of love.  He cared nothing for gold and lived by faith. Does it make sense to you that someone claiming to be His direct representative owns the largest gold hoard on earth?  The Vatican Bank owns or claims to own virtually everything.
          There are only a few problems.  All that American land that the King of England claimed for the Vatican was stolen from American Indians, and the Americans, including the Indians, still claim it.  Oh, that, and the fact that gold is intrinsically worthless.
          If people realize that the paper in their wallets is worthless, it isn’t much of a stretch for them to realize that gold coins are worthless, too.  Gold has very limited uses in industry and other than that, what is it good for? 
          You can’t eat it or drink it.  It won’t keep you warm, cook your food, or run your car.  It won’t keep the rain off your head.  The entire cachet of gold is that it is in relatively short supply, and most of it is now owned by the Vatican. 
          If the Vatican can engineer a worldwide collapse of paper currencies and a return to the “gold standard” it will be able to keep everyone sweating for many years to come, struggling to pay back the “debt” owed as a result of converting currencies from paper to gold.
          Any such change to the gold standard is self-interested hokum promoted by those who have been hoarding up the gold ever since the 1933 gold confiscations.  The same people who provided you with paper Federal Reserve Notes will give you gold coins.  To them, it is no big deal.  A symbol is a symbol.
          What did the English use to purportedly “buy” the North American Continent from the American Indians?  Beads.  They offered the Indians pretty porcelain and glass beads of various colors. Blue beads were in special demand and therefore thought to be especially valuable.  Are blue beads really worth hundreds of acres of land?
          At one time, the entire economy of Holland revolved around trading tulip bulbs. You could buy ten houses for a tulip bulb of the right kind.
          The point is that whatever is used as “money” has no intrinsic value and never has had. It’s a symbol, yet another fiction, a lie, more Tall Tales to enslave you.
          The value of any form of money depends on what you and I and Joe decide it is.
          If I am hungry enough, your roast beef sandwich is worth a million dollars. If you are dead, no amount of money means anything at all.
          Everything we’ve described for you is fiction used to entrap, enslave, defraud, control, rob, and murder people. Money is the biggest lie of all.  America, your money is a fiction.  Your government is a fiction.  Your history is a fiction.  Your incorporated “states” are fictions.  The rats have even endeavored to make all of you, individually, into fictions----trusts and transmitting utilities and non-existent boats. 
          If America returns to the gold standard there is no safe haven there.  Something worthless, paper, will be traded for something almost equally worthless, gold. The only ones who benefit are those who stole your gold in 1933 and gave you “Federal Reserve Notes”.  Now they will take the “Federal Reserve Notes” back and give you nice shiny gold coins called “Ameros” instead.
          They will trump it up as if these Ameros are the real deal, of great value, “money you can trust” and it is all bogus.  It’s all fictional.  They are trading on a mass delusion that these symbols, whether gold coins or pieces of paper, have value, when they do not. 
          This is the reality.  There is no money.  There never has been any money.  Your labor has value, your natural resources have value, and your products, the useful things you make, have value---to the extent that there is demand for them.  
          Money represents market demand for these things, the same way that the trust and transmitting utility named after you represents you.    
          Demand for goods and services, not money, is what makes the world go round.
          Take away the demand, and poof! ---the money is worthless.  Cut the supply of money and you can for a short time create the illusion of demand, which is what the banks have been doing tinkering around with the prime interest rate.
          A bad economy means one thing: lack of demand for your goods and services. 
          What are America’s top exports?  Refined oil products, weapons, air craft, motor vehicles, vacuum tubes, and telecom equipment. 
          Read the list. War increases the value of America’s top export products. 
          Not only do the bankers want to kill off Americans to avoid debt owed senior citizens and to reap the pay offs on all those Life Insurance policies, but war benefits demand for America’s top exports.  Since the Second World War, war has become our business, and increasingly, it is our only business.   
          This shift of the American economy toward production of war-related products was consolidated sixty years ago and the economy has never returned to peacetime production.  This is what President Eisenhower was talking about when he spoke of the dangers of the “military industrial complex”. 
          America exports war, war, and more war, because peace is anathema to the American economy. 
          If we can’t find anyone else to fight, we will have to fight ourselves.  Far from being the peacekeepers, Americans have become the war mongers of the world for obvious and self-interested reasons.  Death, destruction, and misery are our final “products” that we deliver around the globe, and when the economy needs a perk, what do the Presidents and the Congresses do?
          They start wars.
          The reason that America has been kept at near-constant war since 1916 is now evident to anyone reading this.  As long as the American export economy is based almost entirely on war-related products, it can’t be otherwise. 
          The Iranians and the Israelis are at this moment facing each other armed with weapons made in America. 
          Increasingly, other nations have refused to take the bait when the Americans have sought to get a war started.  They all realize that the Americans want some excuse for a fight, because that will create more demand for America’s export products. 
          That leaves us in the distasteful position of interfering in the internal politics of other nations, stirring up conflicts so that other people and other nations will be forced to spend their capital and labor buying American weapons, vehicles, aircraft, and refined oil products.
          What if America manufactured plowshares instead?  Hand pumps?  We could be exporting life instead of death. 
          The Department of Defense could just live up to its name, in a sane world.
          Unfortunately, this world is not sane and cannot be sane so long as people remain fearful, ignorant, and deluded.
          The Communists deprive themselves of the comfort of God. They see that the Pope is self-serving, and assume that God is just another fiction dreamed up to enslave people.  They refuse to have any faith whatsoever in what cannot be seen.   
          Looking at the fictions that have been employed to enslave you, can you blame them?  
          The Americans have turned away from God, too, but they are so deluded that they think they can serve two masters----chunking out nuclear bombs, bayonets, gas masks, and jet fighters on one hand and singing hymns on the other. The Americans are the most enslaved people on earth, in the “land of the free”.
          There is always the truth, and the lie, side by side. 
          There is a real Church, one that lives in the hearts of those who love God, but the real Church doesn’t gather gold, doesn’t preach obedience to men, and doesn’t celebrate death.  The real Church, like real love, is patient and kind and poor, humble in its good works, silent in its own behalf, and it has no name, no human leadership at all.  The Holy Spirit is its Vicar.
          It should surprise no one after reading this that the real church, like the real government of America, has been mirrored and overtaken by the lies and self-interest and corruption of an usurper merely pretending to be the Church.
          Satan mirrors the real with the unreal, the thing of value with the thing of no value, and his servants do the same thing: they create fictions that enslave, they murder people for profit, they rule by making everyone fearful. 
          The bankers created the fiction of money to serve themselves.  The lawyers have created all the legal fictions---corporations, trusts, transmitting utilities, foundations, cooperatives, and so on----as a means of supposedly escaping liability, but in fact, all they do is shift the burden of liability to innocent people.  
          Congress has created a fake government to oppress and plunder other Americans, and used more fakery, lies, non-disclosed contracts and semantic deceit to pull it off.  All the various levels of government in America are based on the same lies.
          Next time you get a bill for DON JOHNSON, or whatever your name may be in all capital letters, send it to the US Treasury.  Tell the nice criminals that DON JOHNSON doesn’t live here anymore, and since DON JOHNSON is a federally owned trust and transmitting utility, you are forwarding the bill to them for payment. 
          The enemies that the real America faces are the same enemies that everyone on this planet who believes in peace, must face. 
          These enemies pretend to be what they are not, but you can recognize them by their methods and their works.  
          They always use fear to get what they want.
          They always use lies to get what they want.
          They always deliver the exact opposite of what they promise.
          America, you need to remember what is true and forget what is false.
          Eighty percent of every dollar Americans spend on social welfare is eaten up by the government in “administrative” costs.  Only 20% of it ever reaches the people that money was supposedly meant to help.  Only 2% of the money Americans give as foreign aid ever reaches its intended destination. 
          The Evil Ones in this world want other humans to be subservient, hopeless, helpless, worthless, dependent, ignorant, and fearful.  They want you to be slaves, and they have done everything they could in terms of deceit and lies and usurpations to make you into slaves--- corporations substituting for your government, false claims against your credit, pretending that you are trusts and transmitting utilities, “US citizenship”, the works, all of it.  
          They have given their own minions, people like Barack Obama, great power at your expense.  They have used your own money to buy Life Insurance policies on your life, so that they may profit by killing you. 
          The usurping corporations that are substituting for your lawful government have joined the banks in criminal conspiracy to defraud you, and have enabled this evil to be practiced against you. 
          The same means that have been used to defraud you can be reversed and used to restore America. 
          Just as they depopulated the American Republic by claiming that every American was in fact a “US citizen” and subject of the British Crown, you can “re-populate” the America you love, by firmly stating who and what you are.  
          They claim that you are not a Living Person, but a trust and transmitting utility belonging to the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico.
          Repudiate it.  Stand up and say, I am a Living Person.  I can act as an Acceptance Agent for this trust and transmitting utility, but I undertake no public office and do not stand as surety for it when I do so.
          They claim that you are a US vessel. 
          Repudiate it. Stand up. If they are foolish enough to haul you into US District Court, make them swab the decks.   
          They claim that you owe a huge “National Debt” and that they loaned you the money. 
          Ask them whose money it was that they loaned? 
          It turns out that the American People are the Creditors owed the National Debt, not the banks.
          Ask them to show you the lawful two-party wet-ink contract that you personally signed making you liable to pay taxes, etc.. 
          Of course, they have documents that they claim represent contracts with you, but none of their supposed contracts were disclosed and none of them make sense. 
          Once you shine the light of day on them, are they going to have guts enough to show the jury your Birth Certificate and claim that you are a vessel in the US Merchant Marine?
          Are they going to explain that you are actually a trust and transmitting utility owned by the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico, and that you just popped out of the file cabinet and took on a human form for the day? 
          The Brits and Vatican have set up a Trust of great wealth to benefit their minions, and left you with a Public Charitable Trust that you pay for.
          Claim the real thing by appointing their trustees as your trustees. Put them in a bind.  They already know what they have waiting for them in International Court, so there’s really no place for them to run.  
          Once you get into it and stop being afraid, taking back America is almost as much fun as playing “Whump the Weasel” and is remarkably similar.  
          The enemies who pretend to be friends have fettered and usurped your lawful government by substituting corporate proxies in its place.
          Does Mc Donald’s have the ability to collect taxes or wage war?  So, then, does a corporation calling itself the “US Congress” have any such right or ability?
          Call them on it.
          These bankers and imposters have placed an openly fraudulent claim against your personal credit and against the credit of your States.
          Refuse to pay it without Proof of Claim. Any “service” not enumerated in the Constitution for the united States of America is on their ticket, not yours.
          They have insinuated a foreign infrastructure to support these nefarious efforts called the American Bar Association.
          Refuse to hire anyone who is a member of the Bar Association.  
          You can’t hire a lawyer, because they are already working for your enemies, but once you realize who you are and what the game is, you will never need a lawyer again if you live peaceably and respect the rights of others.
          The statutory courts and their 800,000 statutes don’t apply to you, because you are not a corporate entity. As you are not a “US vessel”, neither do the Admiralty courts have a claim left to stand on.
          Make a Special Appearance. 
          In Statutory Court say, “Hello, I’m Don Johnson, a Living Person, a “non-citizen National” as defined by 8 USC 1101(a)(21). I am not a “US citizen” nor a “statutory citizen” nor any kind of “citizen” at all. I do not consent to any transaction of a security interest and am a Creditor with respect to the US Treasury. I do not stand under the jurisdiction of this court.”
          In Admiralty Court say, “Hello, I’m Don Johnson, a Living Person, not a “US vessel” and I do not exist under any naval or federal jurisdiction at all.  I do not consent to any admiralty authority and am entirely a Man on the Land. I waive all unearned benefits and I owe nothing whatsoever to the Crown. I do not stand under the jurisdiction of this court.”
          It is the same thing with the banks.  They have colluded against you to unlawfully convert your property and “tax” you-----so refuse to do business with them. No loans. No credit cards. No cash on deposit.  No savings accounts.
          Stand up and take the banks to court.  File criminal complaints against them for unlawful conversions and conspiracy to defraud.  They are corporations.  The statutory laws apply to them. 
          When lawful American banks reappear, give your banking business to them.
          As for the Congress, they can’t pass a law against you or any law that pertains to you, without breaking the law themselves.
          These people are impersonating the lawful US Congress, and merely calling themselves “US Congressmen” and “US Senators” when they are nothing of the sort and they do not even inhabit a Public Office.    
          Refuse to pay taxes to a corporation masquerading as a government.  No corporation has any ability to “tax” you. 
          If they come after you with the IRS, you know what to tell them:  I am a living person.  I operate only in private commerce and accrue nothing but legally defined property.  These bank accounts you claim are mine obviously belong to a corporate entity, a trust and transmitting utility that is a franchise of the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico.  If the franchise has any debts they have to be discharged against the US Treasury.
          It is the same thing with State and Local Municipal taxes.
          These are all corporate substitutes for your real government.  They have no more ability to tax you than Sears.  
          Most of all, if they stage one of their hideous False Flag attacks remember the Reichstag Fire and the Lusitania and Pearl Harbor and “Weapons of Mass Destruction” and 9/11 ---- realize that it is a criminal corporate syndicate masquerading as your legitimate government doing these things and fattening its bottom line with your lives and at your expense.
          Now that you know the game and can play it, get busy, America.  Clean up this mess.  Restore your real government.  Declare the frauds for what they are.  
 
Ex dolo malo non oritur actio. Out of fraud no action arises; fraud never gives a right of action. No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or illegal act.  Black's Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition, page 509.
