&lt;p&gt;I live in Western Massachusetts.  The following is an article that I wrote for the Shelburne Falls Independent Newspaper a few years ago.  Although it is somewhat specific to Franklin County, the area in which I live, the same story is happening in small rural towns all over America.  As a result of the outcry raised by this article...the new zoning regs did not pass...until a couple of years later when we were all asleep at the wheel after they stacked the town boards with their appointees.  One more reason why we should all remember that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                           West County Growing Pains, Is SmartGrowth the Answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The winds of change no longer skip over the remote rural hill towns of West County. These days, the unceasing demands of rapid growth increase with broadband speed over dialup wiring, with frequent disconnects. These growing pains have disrupted the easy ebb and flow of life of the quiet villages and pastoral farmsteads.
 
Everyone agrees that they want and need a thriving economy to survive. They share a strong appreciation for the natural beauty and lifestyle that make the region unique. And yet, preservation and planned growth discussions are pitting private landowners against town planners in the age old battle between ownership rights versus the collective good of all.
 
";Many times, growth is random and makes poor use of land and does not attempt to preserve town character, "; explains Shelburne Planning Board member John Payne. ";We need to decide as a community what common guidelines will determine how land is used without taking away the value and the rights of private landowners.";
 

&lt;p&gt;What is SmartGrowth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Gisela Walker of the Charlemont planning board states ";SmartGrowth is the latest buzzword for growth management. It formalizes what we have always tried to do with our town’s zoning bylaws.";
 
According to <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smartgrowth.org%2F&amp;h=mAQH1m-2v&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.smartgrowth.org\/";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.smartgrowth.org\u00252F&amp;h=mAQH1m-2v&amp;s=1";);">www.smartgrowth.org</a> SmartGrowth is fueled by ";demographic shifts, a strong environmental ethic, increased fiscal concerns and more nuanced views of growth."; SmartGrowth ";invests time, attention and resources in restoring community and vitality to center cities and older suburbs."; It is ";more town-centered, is transit and pedestrian oriented, and has a greater mix of housing, commercial and retail uses. It also preserves open space and many other environmental amenities.";
 
Conceived by the international environmental movement of the late sixties and seventies, coupled with economic and health studies funded by several different sources, SmartGrowth incorporates the shared common land beliefs of Native Americans and blends them with land use practices common to Israeli kibbutzes, and the early collective farms of China and the USSR.
 
The underlying theme is to concentrate people and their employment and access to daily services like shopping, medical services, and restaurants into well-designed mixed use spaces. Proximity to daily activities will increase numbers of people walking and biking, thus increasing the overall health of the population while helping to reduce medical expenses.
 
SmartGrowth mandates open space preservation. The belief is that clustered areas of habitation will concentrate pollutant and resource use-loads, so open space will help to offset these effects by providing areas and places for recharge. Critical Environmental areas are identified and preserved via land use programs such as open space regulation and the purchase of development rights. Restrictive land use covenants and environmental regulations assist so that these large parcels of land may contribute to the balance of the overall ecosystem in which they exist.
 
In theory, SmartGrowth encourages stronger communities because proximity fosters social interaction and increased collaboration in the effort to develop a pleasant, sustainable life for all residents.
 
This approach to town growth and development has the backing and financial support of a strong network of national groups like American Farmland Trust, American Planning Association, the Environmental Law Institute, Fannie Mae, National Association of Local Government, National Association of Realtors, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Wildlife Federation, the Natural Resources Defense Council, The Trust for Public Land, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
 
";Communities that incorporate SmartGrowth principles into their planning and zoning bylaws become eligible for various types of competitive state funding programs that are based on something called Capital Scores,"; states Payne. ";Eight categories of implementation are assigned points and the more points a town gets, the more successful they will be in the competition for the limited grant funds.";
 
Payne described the eight areas which enhance these capital scores including, Planning for livable communities, zoning for compact development, encouraging housing, redevelopment of previously developed sites, conservation of natural resources, sound water conservation policies, sustainable working landscapes and promotion of sustainable development.
 
With so many idealistic theories spurring the SmartGrowth approach, several rural American communities are interested and beginning to develop the systems necessary to implement it in their planning processes.
 

&lt;p&gt;SmartGrowth and West County&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

";SmartGrowth is new in philosophy because it promotes tools to deal with approaches that have not worked in the past."; explains Walker. ";People out here seem to have a very strong belief that they can do whatever they want with their land. It seems to be very difficult for collective thinking to take hold in this area. But people need to understand that your land value is as much impacted by what your neighbor does with his land as it is by what you do with yours.";
 
Many local residents believe that SmartGrowth is not a concept to be approached lightly.
 
";SmartGrowth has been bred by a select group of people in the area who want no growth or development at all,"; comments Chris Singley, local Realtor and Landowner.
 
From inventories of scenic vistas provided for scenic byway funding programs, to local zoning bylaw revisions, to open space and forestry practices, the tentacles of SmartGrowth snake through areas of growth, development and local economics in ways that one would never predict or suspect without a careful, detailed examination. Whereas in theory, it all sounds potentially idyllic and quite workable, in reality, it’s adoption as a guiding principle has another side that is often ignored in the flush of enthusiastic attempts at utopian implementation.
 
";The SmartGrowth agenda restricts the inherent cultural and economic diversity that we value strongly up here in our hill towns."; Singley adds, referring to the blend of local businesses which exist in the Shelburne Falls business district.
 
Singley attempted to build a car wash in Buckland center. However, when he approached the Planning Board as part of the project review and permitting process, he was denied permits based on the fact that it did not fit the ";vision"; that had been recently discussed by a local group. Singley quoted John Cohen of the Buckland Planning Board as saying ";This does not fit my vision for what I’d like to see in Shelburne Falls.";
 
SmartGrowth frequently clashes with private ownership rights. Whereas one would be hard-pressed to find a local farmer who disagrees with common-sense environmental practices such as manure pile management and riverbed vegetation preservation, very few will respond positively to local zoning bylaws dictating the amount of space that they can and cannot use for various purposes, or the type or size of structures they may build to support their farm operations.
 
As he drafted the Massachusetts state constitution, John Adams wrote ";Each individual of the society has a right to be protected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and property, according to standing laws….But no part of the property of any individual can, with justice, be taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his own consent, or that of the representative body of the people."; SmartGrowth practices shift the focus from private land ownership to public land use agendas and desires while using loosely worded regulations that often leave enough wiggle room for corruption and biased interpretations.
 

&lt;p&gt;Buckland Bylaws and Proposed Shelburne Bylaws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

A quick look at the recently completed Buckland Zoning Bylaw Revisions illustrates SmartGrowth Principles that have been recently written into local ordinance. For example, Section 6-2, Cluster Development, Section h.1 outlines a series of seven ways a developer may obtain ";points"; which may be traded for an increased number of legal lots allowed under section 6-2d. This incentive was created to encourage cluster development as outlined in the SmartGrowth principles; but are zoning bylaws the correct place to create ";incentives and rewards"; to support special interest agendas?
 
Section 8-1c of the same Buckland bylaws states that buildings that do not comply with the new code when it is enacted are grandfathered under the old regulations. Under the new regulations, many town properties become non-compliant as soon as the regulations take effect. As long as the owners choose to maintain the status quo, there is no problem.
 
However, if a non-conforming building is destroyed by fire the same may be constructed or repaired on the same location for the same use, ";provided the new building may be equal in appearance and character to the original structure.";
 
This means if a resident’s two hundred year old farmhouse burns down, the only way she can rebuild without special permits or variances is to build the same size structure in the same spot with the same outward appearance for neighborhood ";scenic preservation"; purposes. If the owner wants to locate the new home further back on the lot or prefers modern architecture and wants to replace the older residence with such, she will become subject to all new regulations and the extensive site plan review for special permits or variances.
 
In this case, the owner purchased a property thinking she had free use of the land for whatever legal purposes she wished, she paid for and maintained the property and paid taxes on it, however, rules enacted after her purchase have determined that she is no longer compliant with land use regulations, and her current use is permitted only as long as she is not inclined to make any style or size changes. Her right to use her land as she wishes has been replaced by the open space, historic and scenic preservation principles of SmartGrowth planning and zoning. Should she decide to appeal this policy, she will be required to spend thousands of extra dollars in the extensive permitting process that will be required to override these determinations.
 
As an isolated case, the above example might appear to be much ado about nothing, but a review of the proposed zoning bylaw changes for the town of Shelburne, provides a more common type of illustration. Section 2.1.1 defines accessory apartments, dictates the maximum number of rooms they may have and the maximum amount of square footage they may occupy.
 
This proposed regulation states that only two people may legally occupy the space, which leads one to wonder what happens to the young couple who rents the space and has twins. Is it really the town’s right to tell them where they can and cannot live? If they cannot afford a larger space and feel that they are able to manage in the current space, should SmartGrowth regulations tell them that they must move?
 
The same regulation also states that ";the owner of the property shall permanently occupy the principal or accessory residence,"; thereby eliminating a second rental unit in what may presently be a two family house. How many homes in Shelburne Falls will already be out of compliance with this bylaw if it passes, although grandfathered until they want to make a change that takes them out of that status?
 

&lt;p&gt;SmartGrowth theory in practice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The recent controversy over Wesley Rowe’s proposed Flagg Mountain Development in Conway, points out the problem with private land ownership uses becoming tangled up in the wants and desires of abutting neighbors. Rowe’s plan to subdivide 161 mountainside acres has aroused the ire of neighbors who feel that the environmental and scenic effects of the development will present too large a change to their quiet rural neighborhood.
 
Despite Rowe’s attempts to follow the existing rules and regulations, neighbors still object because there is still the dispute over whether he should be allowed to develop the area at all.
 
";Who protects the rural character and the scenic beauty of our hills?"; questions Walker. ";If more people around here drove East, they would see how ugly uncontrolled urban sprawl can be!";
 
Is it the landowner who wants to legally change the use of the land he has paid for, maintained and paid insurance and taxes upon for many years? Or do the needs, concerns and opinions of the general population dictate what will and will not be allowed?
 
The objections of these neighbors, many of whom live a mile or two down the road and in another town from the proposed development, have cost Rowe thousands of dollars in lost time and extra costs. He has been required to pay for the town Conservation Commission to hire consultants to review the work of the consultants he has already paid to develop the plan. These costs will be passed along to buyers, and will raise the price of the lots considerably. How many smaller landowners could actually afford this kind of cost?
 
Charlemont was recently embroiled in a battle over one company’s wish to put a paintball course on a large parcel of land that is already being used as a ski resort.
 
Neighbors, long used to a quiet, undisturbed rural atmosphere, are objecting to the as yet undetermined noise and the increase in traffic in the woods that they believe this business will bring. Operators of the proposed facility, Frank and Jennifer Mooney voluntarily presented the project to their town and neighbors and were very willing to work with them to make sure this project created as little disruption as possible, short of not putting it in at all. From the first meeting to share ideas and information about the project, a contentious controversy has developed over whether or not the neighbors’ wish for serenity supercede the rights of the Mooneys to legally proceed with their business plans.
 
";We obtained a conditional permit for the business,"; explains Frank Mooney, ";but we have asked to have it annulled. No business would invest the resources to develop and market this type of enterprise with the knowledge that the license could be revoked after a year if the neighbors complained about the noise.";
 
SmartGrowth zoning bylaws have yet to be adopted in Charlemont; however, the thinking to support them is already in place as is evidenced by the Paintball Business decision. How many jobs and tax dollars has Charlemont lost because of this minority’s objection to another recreational use of what is already used as a large recreational property?
 
";There’s a lot more prohibiting economic development in this area than SmartGrowth."; comments Walker. ";People need to look deeper for the real reasons companies locate overseas rather than in Charlemont. I don’t think it’s the zoning practices.";
 
Michael Coffman, PhD., of Bangor Maine has studied SmartGrowth extensively and does not support its approach or implementation anywhere. ";One of the biggest downsides of SmartGrowth is that it creates an artificial limit on developable land."; He explains, ";This makes it far more expensive to build because of the burdensome permitting process and extensive delays."; Coffman points to an article written by Randal O’Tool in which O’Tool illustrates that the evolution of SmartGrowth becomes ";horribly expensive and punitive to lower income families."; (<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americandreamcoalition.org%2Fpenalty.pdf&amp;h=sAQFXpHdI&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.americandreamcoalition.org\/penalty.pdf";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.americandreamcoalition.org\u00252Fpenalty.pdf&amp;h=sAQFXpHdI&amp;s=1";);">www.americandreamcoalition.org/penalty.pdf</a>)
 
Given the already high housing costs and low paying jobs available in West County, is SmartGrowth something that this area can afford?
 

&lt;p&gt;The need for a balanced approach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Both SmartGrowth and landowner rights have many long-term implications. Nobody argues that development needs to be approached carefully, with the overall health and well-being of the general population as a major consideration. SmartGrowth encourages residents to create a vision for a good life in their communities, and to use
 
this master plan as a major tool upon which to base the zoning bylaws and land use regulations.
 
Local farmer, Karen Gould, states, ";Obviously the farmers around here are invested in protecting their property. Most of them have given their lives to work their land, maintain it, improve it and keep it beautiful. We don’t need legislation or zoning bylaws to tell us to do this.";
 
";The worst part, ";Singley notes, ";Is that SmartGrowth divides our community, encourages snob zoning and only allows certain types of business to locate in a district once it is implemented.";
 
Self-appointed groups gather to set visions and develop ";Master Plans"; for growth. They profess to solicit community input, but one has to wonder who in West County would not want a car wash to locate closer than Greenfield. These groups make their recommendations to local boards that are often too hard-pressed to look beyond the apparent benefits of these recommendations, missing hidden agendas altogether. Rather than foster positive community spirit, SmartGrowth begins to create bitter polar oppositions based on unclear communication, and perceived and real violations of constitutionally guaranteed land use rights.
 
Singley and Mooney spoke of the suspected illegality of the decisions which they are forced to live by, but as civic-minded local businessmen who are also aware of economic realities of their towns, both have decided to forego legal action in order to spare the towns costly litigation expenses.
 
SmartGrowth moves the decision-making power on land use from elected officials to unelected special interest groups and individuals who have no accountability to the town meeting members. Who will make the decisions as to what is ";scenic";?
 
";Sign me up for the taste police!"; quips Shelburne businessman and landowner, Jim Richardson.
 
In his work as a Shelburne town assessor, Richardson warns of the dangers of selling development rights. ";People don’t really understand what this does,"; he explains. ";If a farmer sells off his development rights and then has a few bad years and needs money, he can’t go to a bank for a loan, because essentially, he has lost his collateral.";
 
SmartGrowth subtly shifts thinking and planning from the individual perspective to the collective group perspective.
 
";This is a big leap in a state and a country in which private land ownership rights fueled the fires of revolution,"; states Gould.
 
Waving the carrot of promised federal funding to impoverished small towns, SmartGrowth comes into town with slick marketing tactics and strong financial backing, touting all the good things it will do, never mentioning the restrictions and changes of use that it will require if funds are accepted and used.
 
Productive land is taken off tax roles when SmartGrowth open space and preservation guidelines are implemented. When land use is restricted and taxes are lowered, the remaining land must be taxed at a higher rate in order to compensate for lost tax revenues. With some of the state’s highest tax rates already stressing the pocketbooks of residents, can more be expected of them because of SmartGrowth zoning practices?
 
SmartGrowth is like Middle School. Everyone strives to fit in and keep a low profile, because when they stand out as individuals, they are open to the potshots of the homogenized masses. It removes the power of the individual to determine what is best for him, and forces individuals to subjugate their views and approaches to those of their neighbors and peers.
 
";SmartGrowth is a far cry from the society and the personal property rights envisioned by the founders of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the United States,"; states Gould. ";Personal liberty, tempered by prudent social responsibility was expected, not legislated back then.";
 
Has West County really become so far removed from its roots that it needs a local bylaw to define the family unit and then dictate how many unrelated persons may live together in one large house? The proposed Shelburne zoning bylaws will do that if adopted.
 
";But you have to draw lines and start somewhere to define what will and won’t be allowed,"; explains Walker.
 
The most zealous SmartGrowth Proponent will agree that the independent Yankee farmers have wheelbarrows full of common sense and can generally be trusted to avoid shooting themselves in the foot. The farmers already know that the SmartGrowth principles have sound environmental and land use considerations which is why so many of them are already incorporating these ideas in their farming practices. But each approach taken alone cannot work in the complexities of today’s world.
 
";One needs to look carefully at the program and think of how it applies to our area. Obviously not all the principles are something we may want,"; explains Payne. ";People need to come together and really listen to each others’ concerns, then work at finding a balanced approach that will work for the good of all residents.";
 
The wisdom of the Cherokee reminds everybody that all decisions must consider the impact of present actions on the next seven generations. As West County struggles with
 
the task of finding this balance, looking deeper and working harder to blend the best of both approaches can step beyond contentious squabbling and create the new model for growth that truly is smart.
