THOSE WHO HAVE RECEIVED ANY FORM OF ";SUMMONS"; INCLUDING TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS PAY SPECIFIC ATTENTION TO THIS DOCUMENT AND USE IT. IT IS INDISPUTABLE THAT IF ONE ANSWERS A SUMMONS IN WRITING TO EITHER THE COURT OR TO OPPOSING PARTIES, THAT THERE IS NO OBLIGATION TO APPEAR. I was under the impression this was widely known but apparently it was a point that missed.
 
I created this brief document because I found this point etymological historical fact fascinating. This will probably be the shorted doc I ever post to the files. I was explaining the subpoena power that people have in the compulsory process that they have for obtaining witnesses and evidence in their favor. The subpoena power goes BEYOND discussion and discovery, but is an essential element OF discussion and discovery. The subpoena power is virtually unlimited.
 
 
To get right to the point I broke down the word SUB-POENA because many of the words we use today especially in court have ancient Latin definitions. Breaking the word down like this is the best way to understand exactly what you are talking about. Most people of not desire this level of understanding and detail concerning these matters. SUB: ";under"; ";beneath";, from SUBmersible meaning to place UNDER water. The majority of definitions for SUB have to do with replacement, but it definitely has connotations relating to BENEATH, such as in SUBordinate and SUBway which is a train that goes under ground. POENA: Poena was the Roman spirit of punishment.
 
 
Now that we have thoroughly examined the word we can see that it's meaning is much more intense than most would consider. SUBPOENA literally translates into ";under the spirit of punishment";, and the subpoena power is a power that exists UNDER the spirit of punishment, as one who fails to comply with a subpoena will most certainly be punished.
 
 
We can also see how a SUBPOENA differs in radical distinction from a ";SUMMONS";. The summons announces a date by which the defendant(s) must either appear in court, or respond in writing to the court or the opposing  party or parties. The summons is the descendant of the writ of the common law. It replaces the former procedure at common law by which the plaintiff actually had to ask the sheriff to arrest the defendant in order for the court to obtain personal jurisdiction in both criminal and civil actions.
 
 
This definition of summon is perfect and explains that when one receives a summons, they are not necessarily OBLIGATED to appear. You can answer a summons in writing, either to the court OR opposing parties. So when one gets a ticket and answers it in writing, that ANSWER lawfully negates any and all obligation to appear. THIS is why my tickets were dismissed after the second hearing date which I did not appear at, having appeared at the first hearing but the officer did NOT appear to the first hearing. The court could take no action against me because I answered the summons and I was ignored.
