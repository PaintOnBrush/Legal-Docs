<h5><span>I am confused by the state of this country today. Not only does thie government routinely violate the people, but these violations have become so routine that they are more than just expected, they have become so familiar, and so comfortable, that the people would be confused if they stopped violating people. Every sherdd of conventional wisdom has been designed to manipulate people into enslaving themselves to the will of others. Rights, freedom, law, sovereignty, sui juris existence, is all but a thing of the past. This country has been conquered without a single shot in resistance or defiance. Terrorists, are no longer people that use violence against innocent people to create fear fostering political change, the terrorists have been identified as people that exercise the very rights we were told on 9/11, were why the terrorists hate us. Logic, reason, rational critical thinking, every instinct and intuition that guides us, dictate that the way you defeat terrorism is by DEFYING IT, by NOT capitulating to the fear they attempt to force upon us. Government understands this well, that is why they have attempted to rob the people of all of their remaining freedom, it is why they began using terrorism themselves in false flag events. First they had to create a boogeyman they could severely punish, an excuse to justify the atrocities they would commit against those terrorists. They did not even need a real boogeyman thsi time, they just fucking made one up. Phase two of government conquering the people, was in defining the terrorist. The definition given is so broad in scope in encompasses fucking Jay Walking, Fishing, walking out your front door etc. It no longer requires an act of violence, it doesnt even require a thought, all it requires is a bureacrat to allege it, and without any due process of law, punishment. Terrorism is the 21st century witch hunt. Nothing more. I do not fear that the people will not try to take their freedom back. I fear that as happened to the Jewish people in Poland, Germany, and other countries, that by the time they do it will be too late. You do not wait until you have been imprisoned and enslaved to resist. You defend against tyranny by resisting it the moment it rears its ugly head, you meet it with ALL DELIBERATE FORCE and blast it back into the bowels of hell where it derives from. Duty, Honor, Integrity, Justice, Law, Valor, Courage, Equality, Freedom, and Rights, ALL are an endangered species. <br /><br /> PEOPLE, UNDERSTAND, we are under attack, we have been invaded, deceived, manipulated, and almost wholly conquered. The difference between an occupation and conquest, is the capitulation by the people to the servitude being forced upon them. The same evil fought in 2 world wars is upon us again. Hitler was a well financed patsy, a fall guy in case of failure in the effort of global conquest. The only difference is that this evil has taken root within our own country, not some far off land. Only the face of the agenda has changed, the power behind it is identical, and is as it always has been. The Vatican, the world banking elite, also known as the Crown, which has invaded england as well, has ALWAYS BEEN the true force seeking to enslave and control the people. Government failed, religion failed, they could not control the people here because of our sovereign birthrights. This country is the only thing that stands between the world power elite, and global conquest. NEVER in history has global control been so close. The infrastructure has been created and built before us. This is why technology exploded in areas that promote entertainment, but the technology to allow individual independence, to achieve self sufficiency with ease, is not allowed into the public domain. This force has had to implement an agenda over many centuries, to break down the values of this country in order to be able to conquer it. The people are now controlled psychologically by their own preconceived ignorant notions and ill read mad beliefs. And the people at the top of the power structure attempting to rule the world, if not the same exact people themselves, are direct blood line descendants of the old world order rule of Pharaoh. I personally believe that those at the highest levels of this worlds power structure, are not like us, not exactly....human. It may seem a little out there at first thought, but when you contemplate it more, it is the only logical explanation for the complete and utterly inhuman atrocities being committed against man kind today. Whatever land we hail from, we are all sentient free thinking beings, in our natural state. Enslavement is not natural, and is not human. This all being said, all we can know for certain is that we know nothing for certain about them. We do not know who they really are, how long they live, how long they have lived and ruled, nor where they even come from. Something tells me that things we see in religious texts across the globe throughout all history, about beings descending from the heavens, are literally actual accounts of real historic events that actually took place. These descending entities likely installed themselves as kings and explains the unnatural forms of control forced upon people throughout many millennia. They likely created MOST of the world religions, or conquered and perverted the ones like Christianity that teach very much the same things I do at their core once you get passed the dogma and obvious control mechanisms. This explains why religion has been such a successful form of social control. It also stands to reason that these entities, whatever they are, did not always agree with one another, which explains why some kings did everything they could to clench their sphincter around the throat of the people forcing them to breath foul air, and why some kings promoted what I do, individual sovereignty. People have got to begin to question everything that they think they know, because most of it is flat out wrong. If we do not take our freedom and ensure it exists for future generations, one thing is certain, and one thing alone, if we do not defend freedom, it will become extinct and cease to exist. If this country falls to tyranny, the whole world goes like dominoes.</span></h5><br />
