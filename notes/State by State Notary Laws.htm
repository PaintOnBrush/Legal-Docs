Eventually I hope to have all States on here, it is just going to take some time.ALL notaries public across the country are equal and ALL have a duty to hold for collection your bills of exchange (notices), drafts, checks, notes, and other negotiable instruments, as well as to protest the same for non acceptance or non presentment. Non presentment is where the officer demands you to sign their ticket and imposes the copy refusing to make presentment of their original bill, non acceptance is where the entity you try to enter discussion with refuses to accept your notices and respond honorably.<br />If notaries did not want the responsibility of these duties, they should not have become notaries. They are not just guilty of a misdemeanor for failure to perform, they are, but it is more serious than that. They are guilty of dereliction of duty, for having abandoned a duty given to them by law, they are guilty of gross negligence which is equal to fraud, for having a duty and never having exercised the due diligence to become aware of how to perform that duty. If ";I do not know how";, were an excuse for failing to perform a duty our soldiers could quit just by saying they do not know how to hold a gun.<br />The Attorney general, as I mentioned and proved in other posts, works for the crown. I do not care what they say, even if their office over sees the Notary in their state, they cannot redefine what a notary is by allowing them to be ignorant unprofessional and incompetent. These charges are criminal charges, malfeasance and misfeasance are your civil charges. And you can sue according to your fee schedule for damages. The damages ARE the violation of your rights themselves. Notaries will continue to be ignorant until they are forced to perform. And only WE can force their hand by holding them accountable for their inaction or derelict incompetant action.The sooner people stand up and demand they execute their duty under penalty of law, the sooner the notary will be reacquainted with their power. But people first have to learn their duty to discussion to avoid conflict. I try to come from a perspective of empowering the notary by teaching them. If you stay respectful and simply inform them of their duty, they will become compliant as mine did allowing me to obtain protest for non acceptance perfecting my claim of right upon the county sheriff. You can use notices to inform the notary also. Just get another notary to notarize your notice to the notary, and send the notice to them demanding that they perform and explaining what will happen if they do not. Explain the sections that give them their power, and explain you do not wish to take action against them but will have no choice if they continue to break the law willfully.<br />A notary that is uncomfortable performing notarial duties, is no notary, just an individual in another costume pretending. THEY can only be as good as WE are. It is not hard to prove they have the authority to do what you are asking, and it is easy to show them how to execute their authorized duties. If they refuse after being informed it is a willful act and absolutely criminal, and you should not hesitate to throw their ass in a cell under criminal charge. Your charges will establish corpus delict and satisfy all 3 elements of a valid cause of action. The attorney general not any other authority in the county or State can abrogate the duty of the Notary to serve the public in their lawful duties, nor can they be excused from their duties for incompetance of them. If they try add them to the charges as well and do not back down. The statutory codes from state to state are only part of the battle.<br />ALL notaries being equal can perform these duties regardless of what the state statutes say. The State cannot redefine the Notary's role by enacting man made rules. The role of the Notary in common law is long established and unchanging. They are an officer of the court established by LAW to serve the public in matters of non contention.************************************************************************ARKANSAS<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sos.arkansas.gov%2FBCS%2FDocuments%2FNotary%2520Public%2FNotaryhandbook.pdf&amp;h=uAQEd_jMY&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.sos.arkansas.gov\/BCS\/Documents\/Notary\u002520Public\/Notaryhandbook.pdf";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.sos.arkansas.gov\u00252FBCS\u00252FDocuments\u00252FNotary\u00252520Public\u00252FNotaryhandbook.pdf&amp;h=uAQEd_jMY&amp;s=1";);">http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/BCS/Documents/Notary%20Public/Notaryhandbook.pdf</a>§21-6-309Arkansas law provides a fee schedule for the following acts (see §21-6-309 in the back of this book):For protest and record of same ................................ $5.00For each notice of protest ........................................ $5.00For each certificate and seal .................................... $5.0021-14-106.Acknowledgments and authentications.

Illinois is one of those states that do not specifically mention negotiable instruments or protest by a notary OF negotiable instruments directly in their statutes. However, ALL notarys across the country are equal, and the laws of IL also do not specifically PROHIBIT the Notary from performance in respect to protesting notes and other negotiable instruments. The laws of IL DO in fact identify the Notary as a PUBLIC oFFICER as they do here in NY. the laws of NY are very clear and specifically mention the ability of the notary to protest notes. I have used this service personally and I have secured a notice of protest for non acceptance served by a notary upon my county sheriff. People have to understand that LAW is itself what establishes the position of Notary just like SHERIFF. STATUTES can NOT redefine the role of the notary and pervert it into something lesser than what a Notary is. A Notary Public with respect to negotiable instruments, and matters of non contention where there is no contest or dispute or conflict, that Notary is a JUDGE ranked above a justice of the supreme court. A common law judge. In IL it will be more difficult to prove the notary's power because the statues do not specifically mention protest, but protest IS a function of ALL notaries public whether or not the state statutes agree. See any time there is a conflict between federal and State law Federal law supercedes. And the law of the land, the common law, IS federal law and established the position of notary. The LAW itself, the rights of the people, demand the establishment of the notary to assist the public in non contentious matters.MOST states DO specifically mention protest in their statutory rules, but a few do not, IL and NC are among those. But it is so very important that YOU understand and that you can convey calmly to a notary, that they do have this power to protest negotiable instruments for non acceptance or non presentment. And your notices most certainly ARE BILLS OF EXCHANGE. Every single element of a bill of exchange is present in your notice. it is the same exact process of common law discussion that the police initiate with their violation tickets and then of course end up in default if you know what to do. It is SO important that people understand the term notarization is ALL INCLUSIVE INCLUDING THE PROTEST OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS. Protest IS a NOTORIAL ACT so where IL Notary law mentions NOTORIAL ACTS they ARE also referring to the protest of negotiable instruments for non presentment non acceptance.See according to 5 ILCS 312/1-104 b) ";Notarization"; means the performance of a notarial act.

A notary's main functions are to administer oaths and affirmations, take affidavits and statutory declarations, witness and authenticate the execution of certain classes of documents, take acknowledgments of deeds and other conveyances, protest notes and bills of exchange, provide notice of foreign drafts, prepare marine or ship's protests in cases of damage, provide exemplifications and notarial copies, and perform certain other official acts depending on the jurisdiction.[1] Any such act is known as a notarization. The term notary public only refers to common-law notaries and should not be confused with civil-law notaries.*********************************************************LOUISIANA<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sos.la.gov%2Ftabid%2F506%2FDefault.aspx&amp;h=kAQF4ox-_&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.sos.la.gov\/tabid\/506\/Default.aspx";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.sos.la.gov\u00252Ftabid\u00252F506\u00252FDefault.aspx&amp;h=kAQF4ox-_&amp;s=1";);">http://www.sos.la.gov/tabid/506/Default.aspx</a>How to Become a Louisiana NotaryAny resident citizen or alien of the state, eighteen years of age or older, may be appointed a notary public in and for the parish in which he resides provided that he meets the requirements established by law, La.R.S.35:191(C).<br />Notary applicants must be qualified by the office of the Secretary of State and must take and pass the state notary examination unless they are licensed to practice law in Louisiana.

After you have received your commission, you are authorized to take acknowledgments, administer  oaths or affirmations, and witness or attest to a signature. A notary public may act as a witness to and notarize the same instrument. When a notary public takes a verification on oath or affirmation, or witnesses or attests to a signature, the individual signing the record must do so in the presence of the notary. An acknowledgment does not require that a record be signed in the notary's presence.  An acknowledgment merely confirms the identity of the signer, who acknowledges that he or she signed the record.  When taking an acknowledgment, a notary public must determine that the individual appearing before the notary and making the acknowledgment is the person whosesignature is on the record<br />(MY COMMENTS) See this is explaining exactly what the statutory regulation of NY where I live explain in detail regarding functions a notary can perform. Remember the restrictions of the office of Notary Public here relate to documents for use in CIVIL law or RECORDS. What we are using are not that type of document, what we use are notices, bills of exchange, it is a document to offer discussion, for use SOLELY in COMMON LAW. THIS regardless of what statutes say mean that the notary can act as this explains, as a witness to your attmepts to offer discussion to avoid conflict, and can grant judgments based upon witnessing that process. A Notary is clearly explained in Michigan to be an OFFICER(of the court) commissioned by the SOS for the purpose of being an UNBIASED witness. They may not explain what they are witnessing, but the statutory rules of NY STATE go into further detail upon this as to exactly HOW they perform as a witness, by holding bills of exchange for collection and protesting the same for non acceptance.<br />************A notary should not decide what type of notarial act a document requires. The customer must know and tell the notary. ******************.<br />And the notary once it is requested is supposed to know how to execute the duties you request of them. In the 2003 MODERNIZED State of Michigan Notary laws, there is no clear language like there is in NY explaining that Notaries can protest negotiable instruments and hold them for collection, but the prohibitions section explains what the notary CANNOT do. And the duties you are requesting with respect to a notice for use in common law discssion, the process as explained in the state of NY is NOT prohibited of the notary.****************************************************************************<br /><br />Missouri<br />490.560.

And they have only removed it from their page online. I am willing to bet they were getting too many questions about the Notary probably due to my work spreading the truth about this position. Hell, the information that I have provided regarding the Notary alone is worth what I charge for the book and the book covers many many topics, all which lead to the road of freedom. Other notary sections will be posted in due time as I look up each state for those who live in States I have  not yet added. Or just ask in the comments, name the state and Ill update that document like I am about to do right now editing it to add PA.BUT that being said it is still obvious that the Notary in PA CAN protest for non acceptance just like in any other State. your statutory rules are a little harder to follow, but the protest ability of the Notary in PA is absolutely clear. Your notary CAN protest for non acceptance as confirmed by BACKGROUND, hosted by the Department of State. Not only does the background mention the protest power of the notary, but the CURRENT fee schedule reflects the appropriate charge for PROTEST services.<br />This is prima facie evidence that the notary in PA has the same duty to protest for non acceptance / non presentment of negotiable instruments. PA has desperately made all effort to hide or remove fro online access the specific statutory rules that detail these protests, try as I might I cannot find them, but luckily I already know what a notice of dishonor and protest for non acceptance entails. It is a good thing we are not seeking legal advice, but instead acting of our own free will according to our conscience and literally making our own law.  Just because the State of Pennsylvania has decided to hide the statutes that explain protest, it doesn't mean protest does not exist. PA may use the statutory rules of NY and other States where protest is authorized to the Notary to infer their duties and powers to protest negotiable instruments. I have provided here in this PA Notary Laws Section, multiple cross referenced links between BOTH the ACTUAL statutes of PA official Department of State hosted links, WITH Wikipedia, and between those two links we see the obvious, that the Notary in PA is absolutely equal in every respect to the Notary in NY, as well as every other State as a Notary Public is a common law position, the responsibilities of that office just like the office of Sheriff, CANNOT be diminished by statutory ACTS.<br />(<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.suijurislaw.net%2F&amp;h=6AQF6W5H0&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.suijurislaw.net\/";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.suijurislaw.net\u00252F&amp;h=6AQF6W5H0&amp;s=1";);">www.suijurislaw.net</a> get MY book and learn in complete organized detail)<br /><a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dos.state.pa.us%2Fportal%2Fserver.pt%2Fcommunity%2Fwhat_is_a_notary%2F12612&amp;h=oAQHBQ7fy&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.dos.state.pa.us\/portal\/server.pt\/community\/what_is_a_notary\/12612";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.dos.state.pa.us\u00252Fportal\u00252Fserver.pt\u00252Fcommunity\u00252Fwhat_is_a_notary\u00252F12612&amp;h=oAQHBQ7fy&amp;s=1";);">http://www.dos.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/what_is_a_notary/12612</a><br />BACKGROUND<br />As public officials who are appointed and commissioned by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, notaries public are held to the highest standards of integrity, honesty and trust.
