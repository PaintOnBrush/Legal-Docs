 My book contains a chapter that expresses similar thoughts, but I thought I would do a document here about medical rights and flip conventional wisdom on it's head once again. ANY individual, of competent judgement and sound mind, has the lawful authority to authorize their own prescription medications without the oversight or input of a doctor. Any individual may walk into any pharmacy and write an order upon ANY piece of paper, to obtain medicine.
 
      Many are going to freak out about the potential for abuse of this, but even with the complteely overregulated market we have now, people are still getting exactly what they want and becoming addicted. Because these substances are ";controled"; and people cannot get them lawfully, it causes crime. The underground market when it comes to drugs, charges so much and has such a high profit margin, that addiction to these substances in a controlled atmosphere causes crime.
 
    I am not syaing anything needs to be done to deregulate the controlled drug market. What I am saying is that individuals of sound mind and judgement can operate outside of that system. The only requirement for claiming and exercising ANY right is the DUTY to cause no harm to another through such claim and action. You must be more responsible when exercising rights because your freedom can be taken if you make a mistake. Like the exercise of all rights, it is a big responsibility. However this responsibility when in the proper hands of the individual, is almost never breeched. It is the shift in personal responsibility to government in exchange for a limited liability privilege, that has caused irresponsibility. The very prohibition of substances is what has created the criminal underground market that exploits the addictions and irresponsibility of the people.
 
   ALL authority when it comes to medicine, is derived from the individual's CONSENT. You MUST posess this authority in your own right to be able to give it to another through transferrance. A doctor has no authority to force you to obtain a medicine he recommends, ONLY individual consent gives doctors the authority to write medications.
 
  I have personally spoken to the local police here in Tonawanda NY and as police have a DUTY to differentiate and distinguish between that which is law and that which is statute, they will answer correctly as they did when I spoke to them. The police REFUSE to claim that it is unlawful for an individual to write and attempt to fill their own order for medicine. They refuse to claim that a pharmacy has an obligation of LAW to refuse the order. Because it is not unlawful, it IS lawful, because there is no obligation of law to refuse the order, the pharmacy CAN lawfully fill the order.
 
   Before people freak out about potential for abuse they must first realize that everyone who is currently using drugs is already getting what they want regardless of medical need. This effort on my part is about personal responsibility and the exercise of rights, as opposed to the claim of limited liability privileges. Too many of the individual's rights have been stolen and sold back to them as a licensed taxable privilege. Ignorance when it comes to the law is rampant, and people actually have to fight to defend their rights, when law was supposed to do that. Law IS the lawful defense of rights, ALL RIGHTS, and ALL ACTIVITIES which do not involve harm to another are both lawful and rightful. Any statutory code that attempts to violate or infringe the rights of the people in this matter is null and void. The law is on the side of the people. It is only ingorance of the law that is the problem. Everyone is expected to both know and obey the law, but people are not abiding the law, they are abiding their own flawed beliefs about the law, which were derived from others who have never read the law. This conventional wisdom is a cancer on freedom. And I will see it the day it ends.
