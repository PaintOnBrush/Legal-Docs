&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUDGMENT AS YOU ARE ALREADY IN DEFAULT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Dear BTVB,
 
I am writing to you today once again to attempt to offer discussion and conditional acceptance to
 
avoid conflict. As the officer failed to appear for the hearing scheduled for 03/26/2012 I am afforded more
 
time to try to communicate with you regarding notices
 
2A22087CSP, and 2A22087DSP. As my honor
and duty demand I am compelled to continue to attempt to offer discussion to avoid conflict
 
regarding this matter. I hereby withdraw conditionally the not guilty plea I entered in honor on
 
03/26/2012, but I am also NOT at this time entering a guilty plea either. It seems that the last
 
notices I sent were erroneously mistaken to be the entering of a plea which they were not as
 
clearly indicated in them.
This is also not a plea, it is an attempt on my part to act honorably and
offer discussion and ";conditional acceptance"; to avoid conflict in this matter.
 
My first notices offered discussion and conditional acceptance as well as discharged your
 
notices by way of seeking clarification. I am not in any way creating dispute or conflict or
 
otherwise refusing to pay any charge for which I am contractually liable. My previous notices as
 
this one, simply express my understanding of the facts and truth of the matters. Your notices were
 
not clear, concise, and unequivocal as a notice must be. They were very vague and completely
 
insufficient. 1. There is no amount specified which I am allegedly contractually obligated to pay.
 
2. There is no feasible method to answer them as there were no instructions to follow on the back
 
and the web site mentioned on them had been moved. I only found a method to answer of my own
 
due diligence. The new web site address states the tickets have not been uploaded yet, and that I
 
will receive email notification when they are. I did receive an email, but all it told me was that
 
they had still not yet been uploaded. I located the address to write to by mail myself.
 
I accepted your notices with my last two notices, that you are trying to communicate
 
something of great importance to me, but I did not and still do not understand what. And I still do
 
not understand the cause and nature of the charges and proceedings against me regarding the
 
administrative proceeding because I did respond to your notices offering conditional acceptance.
 
As my previous notices did offer I here by once again extend the same offer to conditionally
 
accept that I could potentially be contractually liable to pay the unspecified charges your notices
 
allude to.
 
If you would simply provide what was requested in my original notices, 1. A signed
 
physical bill, and 2. A copy of the lawful 2 party contract making me liable to pay it, I will gladly
 
pay my contractual obligations. If you cannot provide these things which should be very simple to
 
do if these charges are actually valid I will assume that there is no contract making me liable to
 
pay these.
 
Additionally, I am not aware of the existence of any contract where I have knowingly,
 
wilfully, or intentionally of my voluntary consent, waived any of my fundamental rights or
 
protections. As such if these notices remain unanswered and your bureau continues to seek to
 
deprive me of my property, I will be force and compelled by my duty to claim and exercise the full
 
scope of my rights, including to that of due process of law, involving a full jury trial. As the
 
amount in question exceeds $20.00, and I am not aware of any civil contract which would make
 
this a matter of civil law, I claim and demand this common law remedy. Again this is my
 
understanding of the facts. If there is in fact a valid contract I would love to see it, as I have never
 
knowingly or wilfully waived any right, any such contract would be inherently void. Thank you
 
again for your time and cooperation in this matter.
 
Sincerely,
 
Robert D. Johnson
