<span>Notice
to agent is notice to principal, notice to principal is notice to agent.
Affected parties wishing to dispute the claims made herein or make their own
counterclaims must respond appropriately within FIFTEEN (15) days of service of
notice of this action.<br /><br /><b>I am serving herewith, My Notice Of
Understanding and Intent and my Claim of Right, as well as Notice of Estoppel
through acquiescence. You will find the enclosed intact and complete.<br /></b><br />
I Robert of the Forgette Family, a flesh and blood living soul do hereby make
oath and state the following is my truth and my law.<br /><br />
Whereas: it is my understanding that America and all her people enjoy the
protection of common-law and<br /></span>it is my understanding that all living beings (flesh and blood) are created
equally under one creator and<br />it is my understanding that we are sharing this existence on Earth together
under our creator and<br /><span>
it is my understanding that we have been given a conscience to deliberate and
make decisions for ourselves and<br />
it is my understanding that equality before the law is paramount and mandatory
and<br />
it is my understanding that a statute is defined as a legislative rule of
society which has been given the force of law, and<br />
it is my understanding that a society is defined as a number of people joined
by mutual consent to deliberate, determine and act for a common goal and<br />
it is my understanding that the government of America is a Representative Body
and Representation can only come from consent and<br /><br />
Whereas I am a peaceful and responsible human being and<br />
it is my understanding that peace officers have a duty to distinguish between
statute and law and<br />
Whereas I have the power to refuse intercourse or interaction with peace
officers who have not observed me breach the peace</span>

<br />Page 2 of 3

<span><br />
Whereas permanent estoppel by acquiescence barring any peace officer or
prosecutor from bringing charges against a Freeman-of-the-Land under any act is
created if this claim is not responded to in the stated fashion and time,<br /><br /></span>

<span>Therefore
be it now known to any and all concerned and effected parties, that I, Robert a
Freeman-on-the-Land do hereby state clearly and specifically and unequivocally
my intent to peacefully lawfully exist free of all statutory obligations
restrictions and maintain all rights at law and trade, exchange and barter.<br /><br />
Furthermore: I claim the right not to apply for licenses, permits or to seek
permission to do any action, that are already lawful,<br /><br /></span>

<span>I
claim the right to exercise my “common law right to travel”, unhindered,
unencumbered, at my discretion in my private conveyance of the day, to wit, my
private, unregistered, unlicensed mechanically propelled automobile,<br /><br />
I claim the right to possess, cultivate or use medicinally any plant or other
medicine. Also to exercise omnipotent control over all of my own medical
affairs with or without a Doctor's oversight.<br /><br />
I claim the right to possess unregistered firearms and ammunition and to use
the same for target practice at a range or for hunting for food and further
swear under oath never to open fire on another human being unless I am in fear
of my life and as a last resort to protect any other human life. I Also swear
to come to the aide of any peace officer should they request my assistance.
That is my personal oath.<br /><br />
Furthermore, I claim that the intentional blurring of the lines and the failure
to define between that which is legal, and that which is lawful in order to
extract capital from the masses by legislating freedom and then putting a price
tag on it is a crime on Man, and the failure to define between the Natural man
and the State created Fiction is nothing short of fraud, theft, breach of trust
and forced slavery, a heinous criminal activity of the most odious form.<br /><br />
I claim that the courts in the United States of America are de-facto and are in
fact in the profitable business of conducting, witnessing and facilitating the
transactions of security interests and I furthermore claim that they require
the consent of both parties prior to providing any such services.<br /><br />
I claim that anyone who interferes with my lawful activities after having been
served notice of this claim and who fails to properly dispute or make lawful
counterclaim is breaking the law, cannot claim good faith or colour of right
and that such transgressions will be dealt with in a properly convened court de
jure.<br /><br /></span>

<span>Furthermore,
I claim all transactions of security interests require the consent of both
parties and I do herby deny consent to any transaction of a security interest
issuing under any Act for as herein stated as a Freeman-on-the-Land I am not
subject to any Act.<br /><br />
Furthermore, I claim my FEE SCHEDULE for any transgressions by peace officers,
government principals or agents or justice system participants is (1oz of gold
) ONE OUNCE OF GOLD or portion thereof if being questioned, interrogated or in
any way detained, harassed, searched or otherwise regulated and (5oz of gold)
FIVE OUNCES OF GOLD or portion thereof if I am<br />
handcuffed, transported, incarcerated or subjected to any adjudication process
without my express written and Notarized consent.]<br /><br />
Furthermore, I state that it is my duty to Claim such rights, to protect them
and ensure they exist for future generations.<br /><br />
Furthermore, I claim that the law of agent and principal does apply and that
service upon one is equal to both.<br /><br />
Furthermore, I claim the right to deal with any counterclaims or disputes
publicly and in an open forum using discussion and negotiation and to capture
on video tape said discussion and negotiation for whatever lawful purpose I see
fit.<br /><br />
Responses must be under Oath attestation, upon full commercial liability and
penalty of perjury and registered in the Notary Office herein provided no later
than ten days from the date of original service as attested to by way of
certification of service.<br /><br />
Failure to register a dispute against the claims made herein will result in an
automatic default judgment and permanent and irrevocable estoppel by
acquiescence barring the bringing of charges under any statute or Act against
My Self, Robert of the Forgette Family.<br /><br />
Signed: .<br /><br />
