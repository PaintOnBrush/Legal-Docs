The definition of a word in statutory code, is very important. If one does not know the definition of a word used in these codes they will not understand what it is the statute requires. I make careful effort NOT to call these laws because they are not. When looking st the statutory code regarding the registration of firearms we can gleen insight when compared with the highest law of this land, the Constitution.
Every American posesses the inherent right to keep and bear a firearm. A right is not something one needs license, permission, or accreditation to exercise. When looking at the section of code that governs firearms it is important to look at the definitions. For example 26 U.S.C. 5841 says, ";The Secretary shall maintain a central registry of all firearms in the United States which are not in the possession or under the control of the United States."; Without looking further into this to find the definition of the word ";FIREARM"; one woul incorrectly assume ANYTHING with a barrell and a trigger must be registered to the State.
26 U.S.C. § Section 5845 Definitions defines the word firearm to exclude most rifles shotguns and revolvers. The most important aspect of determining your obligations of law is differentiating between statutory rules and laws. TITLE 26--INTERNAL REVENUE CODE Subtitle E--Alcohol, Tobacco, and Certain Other Excise Taxes, IS NOT LAW. This is a mere ACT of congress, statutory code, maritime admiralty law. Registration and licensing requirements can only be lawful by your signed consent. Your rights supercede the authority of the coded statutes, your rights, are the highest law in the matter.
The 2nd amendment, NOW THAT is LAW. It is not unlawful to own and carry a displayed firearm unlicensed and unregistered. As covered in other ";notes"; we understand exactly what those terms mean. A city, county State, or even Federal branch of government cannot remove the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Registration is an offer, a voluntary civil adhesion contract, a limited liability privilege, it is NOT an obligation of law. I am using this example to show how ONE WORD can be redefined to make something mean something entirely different from what it means in common language. This is why one can only be bound to these rules by their own signed consent when they beg to bend to the will of another and leave their property to the discretion of another. It is very similar to the way the word ";Sources"; of income are redefined in the income tax code to excluse the earnings of the average American living and working exclusively within the States. The 16th amendment says the government may lay and collect taxes from whatever source derived, but did not repeal the existing taxing clauses of the Constitution. The term sources of income are defined in the tax code to mean exclusively foreign or commercial or privileged income. However the ignorant people under threat of the criminal IRS incorrectly believe income from whatever source to mean from anywhere. If a tax was unconstitutional before the 16th amendment it is unconstitutional after it. There is no point debating it's ratification it did not grant congress ANY new taxing powers. It merely identified the income tax as an indirect excise tax on privileged income. There is no point arguing WHAT congress has the authorty to tax because congress DID NOT TRY to tax the income of the average American.
