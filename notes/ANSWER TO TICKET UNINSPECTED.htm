&lt;p&gt;ANSWER TO 2A22087DSP&lt;/p&gt;

Dear BTVB,
The main purpose for this notice is due to the fact that the notice I have on citation #
2A22087DSP, says I must answer this ticket within 15 days or I risk both summary judgment and
suspension of my license. I hereby give you the same courtesy, you must respond within 15 days
of you will forever create permanent estoppel by acquiescence to all points not refuted forever
barring this matter from being raised again.
I am attempting to fulfill the requirements of your notice in honor, however it states I am
able to answer online at <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nysdmv.com%2Feplead.htm&amp;h=mAQH1m-2v&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.nysdmv.com\/eplead.htm";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.nysdmv.com\u00252Feplead.htm&amp;h=mAQH1m-2v&amp;s=1";);">www.nysdmv.com/eplead.htm</a>, but 1. That website has moved which I
have found the new location, of my own due diligence, and 2. the ticket referenced has not yet
been uploaded to be answered, and the site states it could take as long as 180 days for it to be so
uploaded for answering and pleadings. This creates a problem as my license could be suspended
and default judgment entered against me after just 15 days, long before it is even possible to so
answer, as such you are receiving my answer via this notice instead. Also the notice states I can
answer by mail by following the instructions on the reverse side of the notice, but there are no
instructions on the reverse side of the notice. As I did with searching for the new EPLEAD
website, I again have exercised due diligence in locating the proper mailing address to answer the
tickets.
I accept your notice conditionally. I accept that you are trying to communicate with me
something apparently of great importance. But I hereby discharge your notice by seeking
clarification as to exactly what you are trying to tell me. It appears as though you are claiming I
owe you money for some reason, however the amount is not specified anywhere on this notice I
have received from you, nor is there an itemized statement of the charges and amounts of them. I
assume you are claiming I owe you money because the word ";transaction"; appears on the actual
notice and on the website I am directed to by the notice. I understand that transactions of security
interests require the consent of both parties, as do adjudication services thereto, and I do hereby
deny said consent to engage in any transactions of security interests.
The conditions by which I accept this notice of an alleged debt are simple. I request a
signed original bill which was not duly presented, and a copy of the lawful 2 party contract that
makes me liable to pay it. It is clear to me this is not a criminal matter as there is no allegations of
a breech of the peace. I will assume that if the information requested, an original signed bill to be
duly presented, and a copy of the lawful 2 party contract making me liable to pay, is not provided
that it does not exist and that I am not liable for the charges.
Let it also be known that I intend to ask questions should this matter go to a trial or a
hearing. I intend to discover the validity or lack there of, of the cause of action against me. I do
not see any evidence of testimony in this ticket that indicates there is a complaining party, there
also does not appear to be any valid cause of action at all. I am aware of what a valid cause of
action is and how many elements compose one, and I do not even see one of those elements
alleged against me. At the arraignment hearing I intend to move to dismiss all charges for failing
to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, as there is no actual injured party. I not only
intend to question the officer about the validity of the cause of action, but also regarding the
elements that compose it.
I suggest it is in the best interests of all parties involved that these charges be withdrawn.
As I stated I do not see any evidence or even allegation of a breech of the peace, standing, corpus
delicti, actual or justiciable controversy, or a valid cause of action. I await your response which
will either inform me the charges have been withdrawn, or the date of the hearing at which I will
appear to secure discussion and discovery in this matter. I thank you very much for your time and
cooperation.
I hereby declare attest and swear that all information in this document is true and correct
to the best of my knowledge and that I have personal knowledge of the facts contained herein and
do accept personal responsibility for all statements made and facts presented
Most Sincerely,
Robert D. Johnson
