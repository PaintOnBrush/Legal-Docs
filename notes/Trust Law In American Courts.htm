Trust Law In American Courts?
 
 
  Many people are buzzing about Trust Law, after the recent release of several videos on the subject by a man named Dean Clifford. That series of videos ( Found Here: <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fplaylist%3Flist%3DPLD3F90888EA73F28F%26feature%3Dmh_lolz&amp;h=IAQGq2nYc&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLD3F90888EA73F28F&amp;feature=mh_lolz";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.youtube.com\u00252Fplaylist\u00253Flist\u00253DPLD3F90888EA73F28F\u002526feature\u00253Dmh_lolz&amp;h=IAQGq2nYc&amp;s=1";);">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD3F90888EA73F28F&amp;feature=mh_lolz</a> ) is from a workshop Dean held with a group of people. The videos were not recorded to be uploaded, but rather to have as reference, so the group could watch it over again whenever they choose.
 
  When they decided later to post the series on their YouTube channel, Freemanitoba, they never expected them to make such a profound impact. But, to our benefit, it did! With the first video having 20,420 views to date, that is a lot of informed men and women out there. That is the goal!.
 
  First, we should do an overview on what a Trust is, and how it operates, as well as its purpose. To do this, I will start by giving proper legal definitions for the most common terms used when dealing with Trusts as well as many different types of Trusts. All definitions given are directly out of Black's Law Dictionary Deluxe 9th Edition, unless otherwise stated.
 
  So, lets go over some of the legal definitions of terms used in a trust, and see if they fit in with what Dean is saying.
 
TRUST
 
trust, n. (15c) 1. The right, enforceable solely in equity, to the beneficial enjoyment of property to which another person holds the legal title; a property interest held by one person (the 'trustee') at the request of another (the settlor) for the benefit of a third party (the beneficiary). •For a trust to be valid, it must involve specific property, reflect the settlor's intent, and be created for a lawful purpose. The two primary types of trusts are private trusts and charitable trusts (see below). [Cases:Trusts key1.] 2. A fiduciary relationship regarding property and charging the person with title to the property and charging the person with title to the property with equitable duties to deal with it for another's benefit; the confidence placed in a trustee, togetehr with the trustee's obligations toward the property and the beneficiary. • A trust arises as a result of a manifestation of an intent to create it. See fiduciary relationship under relationship. 3. The property so held; CORPUS (1.)
 
";Some courts and legal writers have defined a trust as a certain kind of right that the beneficiary has against the trustee, or a certain kind of interest that the beneficiary has in the trust property, thus looking at it from the point of view of the beneficiary. While it is true the beneficiary has the right or interest described, the trust is something more than the right or interest of the beneficiary. The trust is the whole judicial device: the legal relationship between the parties with respect to the property that is its subject matter, including not merely the duties that the trustee owes to the beneficiary and to the rest of the world, but also the rights, privileges, powers, and immunities that the beneficiary has against the trustee and the rest of the world. It would seem proper, therefore, to define the trust either as a relationship having certain characteristics stated in the definition or perhaps as a judicial device or legal institution involving such a relationship."; 1 Austin W. Scott &amp; William F. Fratcher, e Law of the Trusts § 2.4, at 42 (4th ed. 1987)

  Okay. Now that we have just read half a legal dictionary, what does all of this have to do with court, and more importantly, what does all of this have to do with ME? Well, the state is a trustee in a trust created by the settlors (your parents) at the time of your birth. When they registered the live birth, they gave legal title and fiduciary duties to your portion of the commonwealth for your benefit. That is a trust.
 
  In court, the ";judge"; represents the state, the trustee. Thus, the ";judge"; sits in as the trustee. The prosecutor also represents the state. The prosecutor is a trustee as well. So are the marshals/sheriffs/bailiffs. All public servants. All trustees. YOU, the average American, are NOT trustees. You are NOT a trustee, unless you are a public servant who is ON DUTY. You are the beneficiary. As soon as you are of legal age and sound mind, you become the settlor. A trustee cannot be the settlor or the beneficiary. A settlor can be a beneficiary, and vice versa.
 
  That being said, when one walks into a courtroom, and asks the ";judge"; if they are a public servant, the ";judge"; will always answer yes. One it is established that the ";judge"; is the trustee, and we know the prosecutor and the ";judge"; represent the same party, then that only leaves us to assume the role of settlor and beneficiary.
 
  We can appoint ourselves as director, or executor as well. In a trust, the trustee is obliged to follow the policies, mandates, orders, etc. of the executor, for the benefit of the beneficiary. When the ";judge"; acts against the benefit of the beneficiary, they are in breach of trust. What is a breach of trust?
 
BREACH OF TRUST
 
breach of trust. (17c) 1. A trustee's violation of either the trust's terms or the trustee's general fiduciary obligations; the violation of a duty that equity imposes on a trustee, whether the violation was willful, fraudulent, negligent, or inadvertent. • A breach of trust subjects the trustee to removal and creates personal liability. 2. See maladministration.
 
 
  So, the ";judge"; WILL act for your benefit, once it is clear you are the beneficiary. If he does not, YOU can fire him on the spot. Which also creates personal liability. That is not anything any ";judge"; wants. The courts belong to us. This is we the people, not we the law society. They are the fiduciaries. They exist solely for our benefit. Freedom is not given lightly. It must be taken without permission and asserted most viciously.
 
  Everyone says, ";Do your own due diligence."; What is that, exactly? Let's define it, then we can see how many people do their due diligence before they go to court.
 
DUE DILIGENCE
 
due diligence. (18c) 1. The diligence reasonably expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a person who seeks to satisfy a legal requirement or to discharge an obligation. -- Also termed reasonable diligence. 2. Corporations &amp; Securities. A prospective buyer's or broker's investigation and analysis of a target company, a piece of property, or a newly issued security. • A failure to exercise due diligence may sometimes result in liability, as when a broker recommends a security without first investigating it adequately.
 
  Okay, so how many of you knew the court was a trust? If you did not, you have not do your due diligence. Simply asking the ";judge"; questions is considered part of due diligence. They have to answer your questions, and cannot go into a contract without good faith and full disclosure. Supreme court has ruled that all inferior courts are courts of contract. So, without good faith and full disclosure, the contract is void ab initio, as if it had never even existed.
 
 That is all for today, folks. Please feel free to leave your thoughts and ideas, opinions etc. on this topic, or on others. Feel free to point out whatever I my have missed, or may be mistaken on. If I am wrong, I want to know it. Thank you, as always, for your emails and letters of support, donations, comments, and posts.
 
Much love,
