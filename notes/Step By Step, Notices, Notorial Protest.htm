These 3 Notices can be used for almost anything. I currently have served this upon the Sheriff in pursuit of an administrative judgement of estoppel to block all statutory charges. It can also be used to set up a fee schedule with the airport, TSA, and Homeland Security, to put a fee schedule on file for transgressions against your natural rights. I am also working on one of these for the Department of Health to claim the right to authorize my own prescription medications. This is a common law proceedure known as discussion, and it is necessary to avoid conflict. The things I intend to do could potentially lead to conflict, so I am trying to discuss those points, with the county Sheriff, the Highest constitutional law enforcement officer in the county. This offer of discussion to avoid conflict is necessary. Anytime conflict could arise in the course of the claim and exercise of rights, discussion can be used to clarify the issues. And the Notary Public is the neutral third party certifying the discussion process under their common law duties. This notice is a ";bill of exchange";. Here is how the notary and service process works related to the 3 notices below. All points here can be varified by the Department of State who oversees The Notary Public, on the State Department's OWN WEBSITE <a href="#" role="button"><a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dos.state.ny.us%2Flcns%2Flawbooks%2Fnotary.html&amp;h=wAQEtrsZ_&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.dos.state.ny.us\/lcns\/lawbooks\/notary.html";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.dos.state.ny.us\u00252Flcns\u00252Flawbooks\u00252Fnotary.html&amp;h=wAQEtrsZ_&amp;s=1";);">http://www.dos.state.ny.us/lcns/lawbooks/notary.html</a></a>Protest A formal statement in writing by a notary public, under seal, that a certain bill of exchange or promissory note was on a certain day presented for payment, or acceptance, and that such payment or acceptance was refused. My Notice of Understanding, Intent, and Claim of Right, is a bill of exchange. The Notary holds for collection the original bill of exchange and serves a certified true copy upon the party it is addressed to (THE COUNTY SHERIFF, DEPT OF HEALTH, TSA, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, THE AIRPORT ETC.) This bill of exchange doesn't even require payment, but performance, the acceptance of it and a response registered. If the addressed party comes to the Notary, they can pick up the Bill of exchange, by registering a response to the notice, under the same oath I took when I had the original bill notarized. They can discharge my bill of exchange with a response. If they do not they have dishonored a bill of exchange. At this point the notary will notarize my notice of dishonor, another bill of exchange offering 10 more days to respond to the original bill of exchange, advising the addressed party that they have dishonored a bill of exchange. The Notary keeps the original Notice Of Dishonor, and sends the certified true copy. The addressed party can come to the Notary, they can pick up both of the Bills of exchange, by registering a response to the original notice, under the same oath I took when I had the original bills notarized. If they do not register a response the Notary will Notarize a Notice of Protest for Non Acceptance, this notice is not crafted by me as a bill of exchange and held for collection. It is A formal statement in writing by a notary public, under seal, that a certain bill of exchange or promissory note was on a certain day presented for payment, or acceptance, and that such payment or acceptance was refused. (You print this up, have it notarized, and the Notary Public opens a file and holds this original Bill of exchange for collection. The Notary sends a certified true copy, in my case to the Sheriff. If the Sheriff registers a response he may pick up the original bill of exchange and all is done. If there is no response you go to the next notice Notice of Dishonor.) Notice Of Understanding, Intent, Claim of Right, and Notice of Permanent Estoppel by Acquiescence Dear Notice to agent is notice to principal, notice to principal is notice to agent.
