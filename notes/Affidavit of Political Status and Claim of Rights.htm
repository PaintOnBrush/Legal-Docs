To the extent that we may act as Acceptance Agents or Secured Parties under Public Law (48.48.112 and 73-10) for any trust or transmitting utility established in our NAMES by the Department of the Treasury, San Juan, Puerto Rico, we assume no public office or function, do not stand as a sureties, and register no agreement with the Department of the Treasury. We further declare that we as living entities operate exclusively within the realm of non-interstate private commerce in occupations of common right, and that all wages, fees, and any other form of remuneration that we may receive is private property without exception and with no agreed upon conversion.  We further declare that the “United States” dba “US Corporation” must settle by Treaty and Abide by Extradition with respect to us; no documents such as Birth Certificates, Passports, or applications for a Social Security Number or Bank Accounts may be used to presume any valid equity contract, for we hereby declare that all such contracts were entered without full disclosure, are not in-kind, and do not represent equal consideration with respect to us as Living Persons.  We declare that the houses and all property located at ____________________________ belongs only and exclusively to us, as Living Persons, husband and wife, and represents an independent and sovereign landholding of which we are owners and landlords, and which we inhabit, and which is under our civil authority and title.  We reserve the right to receive all payments owed to us by the “United States” dba “US Corporation” as a result of the 1933 gold confiscations and as a result of contributions we made to the Social Security Administration and IRS in prior years, to receive back our own property unlawfully converted, and all that we have earned and that is otherwise due us in repayment and damages for debts owed by the United States and its subsidiaries.  We recognize the unlawful conversions practiced against us. We reserve all rights and remedies and protections due to us under the Common Law and the Law of International Admiralty. This claim of right may not be held against us nor used as proof to claim that we were ever “US citizens”, franchises, or marine vessels belonging to the United States nor ever made subject to the Buck Act or any other Act of Congress.  We waive all and any unearned “privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States” granted by the 14th Amendment Public Charitable Trust and reserve all rights per UCC 1-308 (formerly 1-207) and 26 USC 7804(b).  We rescind all obligations represented by our prior signatures,   nunc pro tunc, on all federal, state, and municipal applications, licenses, and documents for lack of full disclosure, equal consideration, and in-kind contract.  We hold all such contracts void ab initio for fraud, non-disclosure, lack of equal consideration, and unlawful conversion.
