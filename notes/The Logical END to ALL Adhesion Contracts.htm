The Statute at large to become a US citizen is The act of Congress of April 14, 1802, (2 Stat. 153, c. 28, § 1; Rev. St. § 2165
";an alien may be admitted to become a citizen of the United States in the following manner, and not otherwise.”
The case is an 1893 called CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS v. REUM. (Circuit Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit. May 29, 1893.)
“FIRST. He shall, two Years at least prior to his admission, declare before a proper court his intention to become a citizen of the United States, (Mr. Reum did this) and to renounce his allegiance to the potentate or sovereignty of which he may be at the time a citizen or subject. ( Mr. Reum did NOT do this) SECOND. He shall, at the time of his application to be admitted, declare, on oath, before some one of the courts above specified, that he will support the Constitution of the United States, and that he absolutely and entirely renounces and abjures all allegiance and fidelity to every foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty; and particularly, by name, to the prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of which he was before a citizen or subject, which proceedings shall be recorded by the clerk of the court. THIRD. It shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court admitting such alien that he has resided within the United States five years at least, and within the state or territory where such court is at the time held one year at least and that during that time he has behaved as a MAN of a good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same; but the oath of the applicant shall in no case be allowed to prove his residence."; Emphasis mine
Note: They said “MAN” not person as today’s corporate R.I.C.O. statues do not mention MAN. 
 
This statute was only amended once. By the act of May 26, 1824, (4: star. 69, c. 186, § 1; Rev. St. § 2167,) it removed the two year limit that (2 Stat. 153, c. 28, § 1; Rev. St. § 2165 provided. The TERM of their law for Man is NONRESIDENT ALIEN. This is correct but they used this term , knowing everyone would say “ I ain’t no Alien.” Thereby Negating the very thing that would make them free.
 
This maxim of law that apply is ";expressio unius est exclusio alterius."; Are all statutes either comprising man or person? MAN is devoid of Statute. Non resident alien , A.K.A. MAN, is mentioned and excluded in statute because he is the TERM non resident Alien. Meaning Not resident in any contract, therefor Alien to the Constitution, policy regs etc., just as Whiting, The solicitor general stated in 1864 “An alien owes no allegiance or obedience to our government, or to our constitution, laws, or proclamations. . A citizen subject is bound to obey them all. In refusing such obedience, he is guilty of crime against his country, and finds in the law of nations no justification for disobedience. An alien, being under no such obligation, is justified in refusing such obedience. Overan alien enemy, our government can make no constitution, law, or proclamation of obligatory force, because our laws bind only our own subjects, and have no extra-territorial jurisdiction.
Over citizens who are subjects of this government, even if they have so far repudiated their duties as to become enemies, our constitution, statutes, and proclamations are the supreme law of the land. . The fact that their enforcement is resisted does not make them void. It is not in the power of armed subjects of the Union to repeal or legally nullify our constitution, laws, or other governmental acts.”
 
Justice Field dissenting, stated in the Erie Railway case of 1892. I paraphrase to keep this short .";The government thus lays a tax, through the instrumentality of the company, upon the income of a non-resident alien over whom it cannot justly exercise any control, nor upon whom it can justly lay any burden. The power of the United States to tax is limited to PERSONS, property, and business within their jurisdiction, as much as that of the State is limited to the same subjects within its jurisdiction."; . United States v. Erie Railway Company, 106 US 327.
 
This Court you just might be in, has to Produce to YOU, the Three Facts of evidence, stated by the Court above, #1 that YOU absolutely and entirely renounced and abjures all allegiance and fidelity to GOD our creator. #2 And had given YOUR intentions to the court to become a U.S. Citizen / SUBJECT of a corporate nature in writing. There are no other provision of the acts of congress under which YOU could have been naturalized. The Court did State” AND NOT OTHERWISE.” #3 And since the statute at large, Not Code, says it’s recorded in fact two.
 
Either the court has to provide it or you win hands down when the plaintiff cannot produce this fact evidence to you and the court . The Court is the only one that has it not the R.I.C.O. agent coming after you. Why would he have it if all they work from is PRESUMPTION? The court has the record when you became A US citizen as it was “recorded”. That destroys their PRESUMPTION YOU ARE NOT A PERSON, US OR STATE citizen, Taxpayer, or that you are the all cap artificial entity. It then throws the PRESUMPTION BACK AT them . Remember the phrase, See you did not pay attention, to the last sentence in #1 of SUPPOSITION. This is only an infallibility upon supposition that if a thing be true, it is impossible to be false.
 
This is what kills them You made them prove YOU are a MAN a NONRESIDENT NOT IN CONTRACT, therefore the Alien. So…..
 
being the supposition is false on you being a US citizen by PRESUMPTION, the reverse is true that you are an alien, MAN and NOT a PERSON. Who Madison wrote about in his federalist paper 42 and paper 43 The Free White Inhabitant (Alien) man. I wrote extensively on this in my books and free stuff on atgpress for 10 years at least. One was TERMS not WORDS explaining they make up their own definitions .
 
This last part of the case in Which one are you, says a lot
Judge Leavy then went on to quote Assessors v. Osborne, 9 Wall. 76 U.S. 567 at 574,
`District Courts are courts of special jurisdiction, and therefore, they cannot take jurisdiction of any case, either civil or criminal, where they are not authorized to do so by an Act of Congress',--he said it is-- ";a leading case, and has not been distinguished, modified or over-ruled."; emphasis his
