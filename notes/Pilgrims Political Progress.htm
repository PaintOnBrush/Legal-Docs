An American Manifesto

Your Government  -- The Feds
The primary job of the federal government is to control the flow of commodities.   That’s not the job we intended for it, but that is the job it has created for itself since 1908, when Teddy Roosevelt created the first national natural resources strategic policy:  in brief, let everyone else on earth develop their natural resources and sell them to us for pennies on a dollar, while we rat-hole our resources away for the future.
Roosevelt’s agenda required (1) willingness of other nations to develop and sell their resources to us, and (2) mechanisms to control and curtail development of American resources.   American efforts to nail down a share of African and the Middle Eastern resources began immediately, and Teddy birthed the American Conservation Movement to encourage “conservation of resources”.
Fortunately for Roosevelt, the federal government still had control of vast amounts of land and resources in the western states and it was relatively easy to slow down or prevent development.  Congress knew that federal control of land in the West was improper and debated how and when to release land to the western states throughout the 1870’s, but the issue was tabled for later action.  Much later, as it turns out.  The federal government still improperly controls vast amounts of land and resources throughout the American West:  69% of Alaska, 84% of Nevada, 45% of California, 57% of Utah….and the list goes on. 
Much later, successors to Roosevelt created the EPA as part of the same effort to control development of resources, and thereby, control of commodity supplies.
The whole story since 1908 has been about gaining control of commodity supplies and limiting access to commodities to create “price supports”----nice language for rigging the free market to benefit some interests and penalize others. 
Early examples of the government’s encroachment can be seen in FDR’s use of Tobacco Green Cards –basically licenses to grow tobacco---all the way to the creation of Alaskan Limited Entry Permits.   Today the government’s hegemony is virtually complete.   It can use the EPA and other regulatory agencies to shut down virtually any industry, and control industrial output.
It was only a matter of time before the politicians and their friends in industry became grossly corrupt and began using the government’s control of commodities to engage in flagrant price gouging.  We now have the equivalent of an American OPEC shutting down production of American oil and gas, creating an artificial supply crisis, and creating mammoth profits for themselves. 
In the first quarter of 2011, Conoco Phillips reported a 43% growth in profits---that’s 43% after they have deducted every possible expense and tax break.    Americans should, rationally, look at the money going out of their wallets and look at profits like these and KNOW that there is something wrong, but there is one piece of the puzzle still missing for most people.   They don’t know how much oil and gas America really has.
Alaska, the Bakken, and the Great Rockies Reserve
Most people know that Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, was a massive oil strike.  Very few can comprehend how massive it truly was and is.   By piecing together US Geological Survey, Energy Information Administration, and oil industry reports, it becomes clear that Alaska’s North Slope contains at least a trillion barrels of oil, most of it accessible on land or via shallow coastal drilling.  Even without new access to deposits on federally controlled land, there are hundreds of billions of barrels of primary, secondary, and heavy oil still just sitting on the North Slope, not being produced.
Alaska’s oil companies have reduced the flow of oil through the TransAlaska Pipeline System (TAPS) by about 6% per year for over a decade, giving everyone the impression that oil supplies are just naturally petering out. It was, therefore, quite a shock when Great Bear Petroleum addressed the Alaska Legislature and informed everyone that the Alaska oil boom hasn’t even begun.   While Great Bear focused on shale oil production, conventional Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) estimates are almost equally staggering.  
Properly managed and developed, Alaska could produce ten million barrels of oil per day for a hundred years and support five TransAlaska Pipelines.
Then there’s the Bakken, the Williston Basin, an oil reservoir sitting under North and South Dakota and Eastern Montana that is five times the size of Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay.   A little farther south and west on the Eastern side of the Rocky Mountains and only one thousand feet down, lies the Great Rockies Reserve, an oil deposit so vast it dwarfs all known Middle Eastern oil deposits.  (<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usgs.gov%2Fnewsroom%2Farticle.asp%3FID%3D1911&amp;h=7AQH8KeyE&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=1911";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.usgs.gov\u00252Fnewsroom\u00252Farticle.asp\u00253FID\u00253D1911&amp;h=7AQH8KeyE&amp;s=1";);">http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1911</a> for Bakken estimates and respectively, <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stansberryonline.com%2FOIL%2F&amp;h=yAQEfhjEy&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.stansberryonline.com\/OIL\/";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.stansberryonline.com\u00252FOIL\u00252F&amp;h=yAQEfhjEy&amp;s=1";);">http://www.stansberryonline.com/OIL/</a> for the Great Rockies.)
Unavoidable Logic
It is apparent from the foregoing that we are in an artificially created oil supply crisis.  We have oil, oil everywhere, and not a drop to burn.  The oil companies are purposefully slacking back on production to maximize prices and profits for themselves.  They have created an American OPEC.  This can only be accomplished with the blessings of the federal government, which would otherwise act to enforce production quotas for the oil companies, as it did during World War II.
The oil market is not the only market being manipulated in this fashion.  Every commodity from salmon to sow bellies is similarly rigged to profit favored individuals and corporate interests.  Money, the “commodity of commodities” is the most manipulated commodity of all.
The most telltale and unavoidable sign of supply side commodity manipulation and “non-production” policies is widespread unemployment.   When they cut production and limit commodity supplies to gouge profits, they have to lay off workers.   Unless average Americans act in their own self-defense to reform government and expose this corruption, we can expect to see 30% unemployment by 2025 and proportionately massive loss of private property.
Government Finances
There’s one other important issue to address before we leave the federal government behind, and we’ll address it here, though it applies to all 9,000-plus government entities operating in the United States---crooked government accounting practices.
Since 1946 government has neatly divided its total income into “budgeted” and “non-budgeted” income streams.   The budgeted amount is all we ever see or publicly debate.   The Congress and state legislatures control the budgeted portion.  The non-budgeted and investment income is handled by the Executive Branch, and it typically far exceeds the budgeted money. 
Imagine that you have a total income of $100,000, and you decide to budget $20,000 to live on.  Over the course of the year, you wind up spending $25,000, leaving you with a $5,000 “budget deficit”. You still have $75,000 still sitting in the bank, but you can whine all day about your budget deficit if you want to do so. 
That’s what our government has been doing for sixty-plus years.   Nationwide, units of government in America have amassed at least $100 trillion dollars in liquid assets---that means not counting the value of buildings, land, etc.   If all units of government---federal, state, local---divested 10% of their liquid assets, we could pay down 75% of the National Debt within 30 days.
Once a year, the federal government compiles the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, and requires all other units of government to do the same.   In recent years they’ve played around with what they call this report, and have developed ever-more arcane accounting practices in efforts to hide their money, but still, once a year, they have to bare all and account for ALL income streams. 
These reports detail the situation cited above---and also shine light on a basic corruption of our government.  The Legislative Branch, not the Executive, is meant to control all finances for government, but since 1946, has been sharing that duty with the Executive Branch----basically using the Executive Branch as a holding tank for all the excess money, and creating an out of sight, out of mind political aristocracy, because all the “unrestricted” and investment income managed by the Executive Branch is in the control of political appointees.
More Logic
We have lived in terror of a paper dragon---the trumped up National Debt, which represents nothing more or less than the government’s unwillingness to pay its debts using the money we have already given it for precisely that purpose.   Moreover, it is evident that our government is self-serving.   It has indulged in what common people call “poor mouthing”----pretending to be poor, indeed, practically insolvent, as an excuse to continue levying more and more taxes. 
Our own government has become mindlessly corrupt and parasitic. 
The first step in correcting the situation is to demand that our legislative bodies take back control of ALL the income, both budgeted and non-budgeted.   Demanding that the legislatures do their duty means that the public once again sees how much money government really has, and elected representatives are held accountable for managing it. 
The second step is to start building a coalition of 37 state governments to push reform of the federal government.  The federal control of land and resources in western states used to be viewed as “their problem” by the more populous and politically powerful coastal states, but it no longer is.  Over 4,500 factories employing more than 500 people each have closed since 2001.  The non-production policies of the government and price-gouging on commodity prices has led to steep economic decline for all fifty states and all now share a similar self-preservation interest in seeking reform of the federal hegemony.
Always remember---the fifty states created the federal monster, and the fifty states can end it or reform it as they will
Your Government – The States
If the state governments are to be the tool with which we finally enforce a broad spectrum reform of the federal government, they must first be cleansed of similar corruptions.
We will use Alaska as an example, but the same concepts apply to any resource-rich western state, and most concepts apply to the coastal states as well.
Alaska, like most states, has vast investment capital derived from the “non-budgeted” or “unrestricted” income that it has cashiered away under the control of the Executive Branch.   Based on the State of Alaska Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (and a compilation of information from the similar Annual Financial Reports generated by each of its subfund agencies,) the State of Alaska controlled slightly over $3 trillion dollars in liquid investment assets in 1999.
No similar survey of total income and liquid investment assets has been done in the years since, but it can be safely assumed that the state holds similar or greater amounts of unrestricted and investment capital now.  This vast bulk of money is under the control of political appointees in the Executive Branch of government, contrary to the constitutional mandate that government finances be under the control of our elected representatives and the Legislative Branch of government.
Forcing the state legislature to resume its constitutional role and control of ALL State of Alaska finances is the first step toward reform.  
Forcing the legislature to undertake its true vocation does three things.  It forces the total income of the state government to be exposed to public knowledge.   It brings the state’s finances back under the control of elected representatives and makes it possible for the citizens to weigh in on how the money is managed and spent.   It ends corrupt accounting practices and usurpation of power by the Executive Branch.
 
The Role of The Subfunds
Just as the state government as a whole hides its money in the Executive Branch, the Executive Branch then hides it again in what are known as “subfunds”.   The political appointees who control the bulk of the State of Alaska’s wealth are all managers of subfunds. 
Examples of subfunds in Alaska include the Alaska Mental Health Trust, the University of Alaska, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, AIDEA, AEA, and so on.   In addition to all these pots of income and investment capital, the Commissioner of the Department of Revenue oversees specific investment funds, one for domestic and one for international equity investments. 
While most of the subfunds have legitimate functions, they are also very large repositories of government slush and depending upon the whims of political appointees may be grossly mismanaged. The Executive Branch functions as a kingdom, and the subfund managers as princes in charge of their own fiefdoms.
Any true accounting of the State of Alaska’s finances and gross income must entail the arduous effort to assess the income and investment assets of all these various subfunds.   There is, understandably, great resistance to this remedy by the Executive Branch, however, it must be done if we are to have any rational management of state finances.  
Failure to address total income along with total expenses in a budgetary process is in itself an act of malfeasance by the government.  
 
 
Enstar and ASAP – An Example of the Trouble We Get Into
State of Alaska subfunds have a great deal of money to invest and reinvest on a periodic basis every year, and they have investment funds within their subfunds of every kind, sort, and description.  Several of the subfunds, notably AHFC, the University, the Alaska Mental Health Trust Fund, and the domestic equity funds overseen by the DOR Commissioner, have favored investments in Alaska’s public utilities.
They reason that these investments are necessary for Alaska and, as they all provide for arbitrary regulated “above cost” profit, are safe and very profitable.   This is true.  Gas utilities in Alaska enjoy a regulated profit of 12% above cost, no matter what the cost may be, a return far in excess of anything available in the conventional bond market.
The problem ensues when the subfunds invest in companies or projects that are uneconomic, yet still guaranteed to receive a regulated profit----like Enstar Natural Gas Company and its Alaska Stand Alone Pipeline (ASAP).
The small diameter ASAP pipeline has announced a tariff ---cost of delivering gas---of  “between $11.49 and $17.06 per thousand cubic feet of gas” according to its sponsor, the Alaska Gas Development Corporation.  We presently import propane and could import natural gas from Canada at a cost of $9.67 per thousand.
We can truck gas in from Canada more cheaply than we can transport via ASAP. 
The State of Alaska would have to provide a subsidy to make up the difference, otherwise, the gas delivered by ASAP couldn’t compete against the Canadian gas in the marketplace.   Any in-state pipeline must meet or beat the benchmark, or consumers will buy the cheaper Canadian gas.
How much would such subsidies be?  Using the current transport costs and the current domestic daily usage of half a billion cubic feet per day or 500,000 units of 1000 cubic feet each, we find  we would need a subsidy of $910,000 at the $11.49 rate, and $3.69 million at the $17.06 rate per day to make ASAP competitive. 
Just to make ASAP competitive, the State of Alaska would have to provide between $330 million and $1.35 billion dollars in subsidies every year of operation. 
Nonetheless, the State of Alaska subfunds are invested in the effort, and Enstar as a public utility is guaranteed a 12% above cost regulated profit, so despite any other rationale, $30 million public dollars have already been wasted on a gas pipeline effort that we could not afford to operate and which can only increase the cost of gas to consumers.  The perpetrators have requested another $200 million to push this ill-considered project forward.
The subfund managers and Enstar don’t care about cost to consumers, because they make 12% above cost, whatever the cost is. 
These sorts of internecine investments and public-private investment interests are the source of endless corruption and waste.  They have undermined any semblance of a competitive public contract bidding process and continue to result in a long list of White Elephant public projects based on fanciful and self-interested prospects rather than solid economics.
The thing that makes these boondoggles possible is the collusion between public sector subfunds managed by political appointees and private sector business interests, aided and abetted in ASAP’s case by State of Alaska regulatory powers. 
None of this mismanagement would be possible if the Alaska Legislature were fulfilling its constitutionally mandated function, because all this money and all these investments would be subject to public knowledge, scrutiny, and oversight.   
We would have a list of private sector companies that the state has invested in through its subfunds, and contracts going to those companies would be subject to special scrutiny and requirements. 
Action Plan
We force the legislature to do its real job.  We insist that the State of Alaska divulge its total income as well as total expenses.  We require public disclosure of all State of Alaska investments in private sector companies.   We call the Big Three oil companies on the carpet for their non-production shenanigans, and give them a choice that they can understand---use it or lose it.   We open up the long delayed conversation with SINOPEC, BG, RESPSOL, Great Bear, and other companies who are eager to develop Alaska’s oil and gas resources.  When the oil companies see that the jig is up, they’ll get back to work. 
As these planks of recovery are laid down at the state level, we open up the conversation with other states, and we show them how their economies are being destroyed by federal non-development policies.   Once we get a critical mass of state governments moving in one direction, we bypass Congress entirely and directly reform the federal government, forcing it to release its improper land and resource holdings in the western states, and strictly reducing its powers and functions. 
It’s simple, and it must be done.
