To begin this document is not intended to be an ";I'm smarter than you,"; arrogant jab against the people. You must realize you are the victim of an elaborate scam that is well camoflauged, well financed, and very very clever. I am no different than any of you, I am just aware of it now.
No one I am aware of other than myself, has ever read the Motor Vehicle Act. I have read it repeatedly and examined it thoroughly, and I cannot understand it. I do not comprehend it, grasp it, stand under it, understand it, or seize it. That being said I am not ignorant of what it is. The motor vehicle Act are the rules of a civil adhesion contract. The word understand itself when talking to cops and judges does not mean what you think it does, when you claim to understand you are giving consent to authority over you. No one should stand under this lawyerspeak, and do not even get me started on the income tax act. The IRS doesnt even understand the income tax act, IT IS NOT LAW.
The authority for it is CREATED when you submit an application for registration, and beg to bend to the will of the State, Begging them to accept COMPLETE ABSOLUTE OWNERSHIP of your property for safe keeping. You are further begging to continue to use that property UNDER THEIR PERMISSION. The STATE does not accept your property under the motor vehicle act, it accepts it undre MARITIME ADMIRALTY SALVAGE, and then because it owns it, will license it back to you as a taxable privilege. They will hold the Allodial title you sign over upon registration as surety for your compliance to the Motor Vehicle Act. Your driver's license is not permission to own property nor to the lawful use of that property, not even to use the public road ways as you paid for them they are yours also. Your license is permission to use the STATE'S CAR the car you registered and GAVE TO THEM, WAIVING ALL RIGHTS, in exchange for a limited liability privilege.
If you do not register your property you are not bound to the rules of that contract. Only your signed consent can move you into Maritime Admiralty jurisdiction, out of the common law jurisdiction. If you do not register your property, an officer cannot impound or seize it for any reason. An individual who maintains absolute ownership of their property has the inherent right to use ANY level of force necessary to protect it, even against those who have a leagal claim to seize it. The inclusion of one provides the exclusion of the other. There cannot be two parties both with the lawful right to use force to protect property, so an officer cannot use force to say, ";IMPOUND"; your car.
If you do not register your property you do not waive by signed consent the right not to be deprived of property except upon conviction by a jury of your peers. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN OBLIGATION OF LAW TO REGISTER YOUR PROPERTY OR GIVE IT TO THE STATE, IN ORDER TO EXERCISE YOUR COMMON RIGHTS TO OWN AND LAWFULLY USE AND ENJOY PROPERTY.
Americans have a duty to claim and exercise rights to ensure that they exist for future generations. If you register your property you are not claiming and exercising a right, you are waiving a right in exchange for a privilege.
Police officers have a duty to differentiate between these statutory civil adhesion contractual obligations, and laws. Yes, suppose we let everyone travel without license, that would be wonderful, people would own property for a change.
To summarize, the Motor Vehicle Act, being a mere ACT, and NOT LAW, statutory rules bound by signed consent, is not applicable to you UNTILL YOU REGISTER your car. I have read it repeatedly, why would anyone agree to this jibberish? YOU HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO AGREE TO ANYTHING TO EXERCISE YOUR COMMON RIGHTS.
You tell me which is law, the Motor Vehicle Act Or these supreme court rulings.
";The use of the highways for the purpose of travel and transportation is not a mere privilege, but a common and fundamental Right of which the public and the individual cannot be rightfully deprived."; [emphasis added] Chicago Motor Coach vs. Chicago, 169 NE 22; Ligare vs. Chicago, 28 NE 934; Boon vs. Clark, 214 SSW 607; 25 Am.Jur. (1st) Highways Sect.163.
 
";The Right of the Citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, either by horse drawn carriage or by automobile, is not a mere privilege which a city can prohibit or permit at will, but a common Right which he has under the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."; [emphasis added] Thompson vs. Smith, 154 SE 579.
 
";...For while a Citizen has the Right to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, that Right does not extend to the use of the highways, either in whole or in part, as a place for private gain. For the latter purpose no person has a vested right to use the highways of the state, but is a privilege or a license which the legislature may grant or withhold at its discretion."; State vs. Johnson, 243 P. 1073; Hadfield, supra; Cummins vs. Homes, 155 P. 171; Packard vs. Banton, 44 S.Ct. 256; and other cases too numerous to mention.
 
 
";Heretofore the court has held, and we think correctly, that while a Citizen has the Right to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, that Right does not extend to the use of the highways, either in whole or in part, as a place of business for private gain."; Barney vs. Board of Railroad Commissioners, 17 P.2d 82; Willis vs. Buck, 263 P.l 982.
 
 
What is this Right of the Citizen which differs so ";radically and obviously"; from one who uses the highway as a place of business? Who better to enlighten us than Justice Tolman of the Supreme Court of Washington State? In State vs. City of Spokane, supra, the Court also noted a very ";radical and obvious"; difference, but went on to explain just what the difference is:
";The former is the usual and ordinary right of the Citizen, a common right to all, while the latter is special, unusual, and extraordinary.";
 
";This distinction, elementary and fundamental in character, is recognized by all the authorities."; State vs. City of Spokane, supra.
 
 
";the right of the Citizen to travel upon the highway and to transport his property thereon in the ordinary course of life and business, differs radically and obviously from that of one who makes the highway his place of business and uses it for private gain in the running of a stagecoach or omnibus. The former is the usual and ordinary right of the Citizen, a right common to all, while the latter is special, unusual, and extraordinary."; Ex Parte Dickey, (Dickey vs. Davis), 85 SE 781.
 
 
The right of the Citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, in the ordinary course of life and business, is a common right which he has under the right to enjoy life and liberty, to acquire and possess property, and to pursue happiness and safety. It includes the right, in so doing, to use the ordinary and usual conveyances of the day, and under the existing modes of travel, includes the right to drive a horse drawn carriage or wagon thereon or to operate an automobile thereon, for the usual and ordinary purpose of life and business."; Teche Lines vs. Danforth, Miss., 12 S.2d 784; Thompson vs. Smith, supra.
 
 
";Personal liberty -- or the right to enjoyment of life and liberty -- is one of the fundamental or natural rights, which has been protected by its inclusion as a guarantee in the various constitutions, which is not derived from nor dependent on the U.S. Constitution... It is one of the most sacred and valuable rights [remember the words of Justice Tolman, supra.] as sacred as the right to private property...and is regarded as inalienable."; 16 C.J.S. Const. Law, Sect.202, p.987.
