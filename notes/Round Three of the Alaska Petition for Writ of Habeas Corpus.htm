MOTION TO BAR UNITED STATES ATTORNEY ENTRY AND ADDENDUM TO PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS IN RESPONSE OPPOSITION
 
Reply to allegations of improper or insufficient Notice:
            The United States Attorney is merely presuming to have a valid interest in the proceedings related to our Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, and is similarly presuming to have standing.
            The Named Respondents are both living entities and Officers of the corporations named as Respondents.   When they are given Notice in one capacity, they are unavoidably given Notice in all other capacities.  
            To argue otherwise would be to assert that information given to Barack Obama was not given to the President of the United States.
            Thus our Notice to the Principals in this case does provide valid Notice to their Agents in both capacities, and the Petitioners have properly respected the free agency of the Respondents in both their capacities to choose and designate their representatives.
            The “United States of America” is a corporation.  The in-house status of the United States Attorney does not necessarily imply that he has valid interest in this case, and there is no evidence presented that he does.
            An attorney representing a corporation must appear with the corporate charter and law in his hand, and if he is representing a foreign corporation, he must additionally present his Foreign Agents Registration Statement.  See Foreign Agents Registration Act (22 USC Section 612 et seq.), and also see Victor Rabinowitz et. al. v Robert F. Kennedy 376 US 605.  
            Also, if the United States Attorney proposes to represent a corporate client, he must declare a non-attorney representative of the corporation in association with his representation.  The arguments of the United States Attorney, verbal or written, are insufficient otherwise per US Supreme Court, Trinsey v. Pagliaro.
            The United States Attorney has failed to establish standing.  He has not declared who or what he proposes to represent or what interest of theirs is at stake.  He has not declared himself as the attorney representing any living person.  He has not provided documentation to represent any corporation, foreign or domestic.  He has not even told the Court or the Petitioners which version of “United States” he represents, but leaves it to us to derive this key information from his arguments. 
            The United States Attorney must clearly and exactly state whom or what he represents, such that the attorney-client relationships are delineated and entered into the record.  He must provide all necessary documentation concurrent with his entry into these proceedings. He cannot merely presume to have standing and impose upon us and pretend that he is owed separate Notice.  
            Petitioners note that their method of providing Notice has been employed the world over circa 1800 and ever since, and it has proven to be singularly effective, as it has self-evidently been effective in this case.  The United States Attorney was able to file a timely response.
            Petitioners have not addressed a Federal Court jurisdiction and do not consent to any change of venue requiring Federal Civil Procedure, but they note that Rule 4(i) applies to summons, not appeals which are the result of summons and related actions inviting appeal, and that Rule 4(m) allows 120 days to correct any lapse of Notice. 
            Petitioners do not wish to be uncivil or unreasonable, but they insist that the United States Attorney show a modicum of respect to the Alaska Supreme Court.  He must identify his specific client(s) provide all necessary documentation to establish standing, and address the proper rules and jurisdiction of the court, or he must be barred from these proceedings. 
 
ADDENDUM TO PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS IN RESPONSE OPPOSITION
 
In response to issues raised, we present these additional Grounds in our favor.
 
Ground 17.  Any purported privilege of  “sovereignty” or “immunity from suit” claimed by the “United States of America” is counterclaimed by equal sovereigns;  the existence of public contract, The Constitution of the United States of America, albeit more properly described in the implied venue as a “treaty”, establishes that consent exists and immunity is not within claim. 
 
            While admitting (Ground 13) that the Commonwealth version of “United States of America” comprised of  “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam…. et alia.”  possesses its own sovereignty, it cannot claim greater sovereignty than that possessed by the Petitioners, who are Equal Sovereigns, such that we meet the “United States of America” comprised of  “….the District of Columbia, Guam, et alia….” on equal grounds on all matters in any venue of Law.  It is not credible for the Respondents or their presumed Agents to pretend that this fact is unknown after over two centuries of open international declaration.
            The Petitioners have already addressed their standing under Canon and Divine Law, and the Law of Nations, the only venues of Law in which the issue of sovereignty is addressed.  The Sovereign standing of American Natural-born State Nationals may be problematic for the Commonwealth, but it is their problem, not ours. The Lords of Creation forever demand subservience from legal fictions created by their own hands.
            The “United States of America” has consented in public to be sued and otherwise subjected to actions such as the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus as a consequence of having entered into a contract, which is clearly in evidence as “The Constitution of the United States of America”, with the 50 States United and by subrogation, the Petitioners, who are Equal Sovereigns in every respect, and no immunity from prosecution on the basis of unequal sovereignty or  any claim of ‘non-consent’ may be advanced.
            The Respondents might as well argue that England and France have no ability to enter into contractual agreements and that neither may prosecute the other for damages should they fail to perform under contracts they agreed to.  It is equally specious to suggest that once entered into a public contract, these nations are able to retroactively assert that they did not “consent” to it and its foreseeable consequences by virtue of any attribute of sovereignty.
             The Petitioners could assert that we did not consent to our marriage vows despite a thousand witnesses, but the effect would merely be to reveal that we are either liars with no respect for truth, or madmen who have lost sense of what truth is.  It would be profoundly in our self-interest to void all contract and treaty with the “United States of America” and simply kick these Commonwealth vermin  off our shores, but we have not denied the validity of the contract known as The Constitution of the United States of America. Instead, we have objected to the outrageous infringements being made upon it, sought protection of our interests, and demanded performance.
            The “United States of America” aka, “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam….et alia” a Commonwealth nation and its Agents, Respondents Named in this Petition,  have offered by their actions to infringe the following contractual guarantees held as property interests by the Petitioners who are Equal Sovereigns:
<ul><li>Article I Section 9, Clause 2’s right to seek Writ of Habeas      Corpus;</li>
<li>The First Amendment’s right to petition the Government      for a redress of grievances;</li>
<li>The Fourth Amendment’s right to be free from      unreasonable searches and seizures;</li>
<li>The Fifth Amendment’s right to be free from charge for      an infamous or capitol crime until presentment or indictment by a Grand      Jury;</li>
<li>The Fifth Amendment’s right to be free from deprivation      of life, liberty, or property, without Due Process of law;</li>
<li>The Sixth Amendment’s right in criminal prosecutions to      enjoy a speedy trial by an impartial jury in the State and District where      the crime shall have been committed;</li>
<li>The Sixth Amendment’s right to be informed of the      nature and cause of the accusation;</li>
<li>The Sixth Amendment’s right confront witnesses;</li>
<li>The Sixth Amendment’s right to Counsel;</li>
<li>The Eighth Amendment’s right to be free from excessive      bail and fines, and cruel and unusual punishment;</li>
<li>The Fourteenth Amendment’s right to be free from      deprivation of life, liberty, or property, without Due Process of law</li>
</ul>            In all venues of Divine and Canon Law and as is notorious under the Law of Nations, the Petitioners are without exception Sovereigns by Nature, Sovereigns by International Declaration, and Sovereigns at Law.  The “United States of America” cannot offer plea of any   “ unequal sovereignty” against Us, nor having entered into contract with Us can it propose that it has “immunity” from prosecutions related to infringement of or Dishonor of any contract (or “treaty” as it may also be described) jointly held, nor may it claim that it has somehow “not consented” to be prosecuted, sued, impugned, subjected to demand, and offered up for petition against infringement of this specific agreement, because the same “United States of America” in Public Record willfully and self-interestedly created, offered, and entered into the contract known as “The Constitution of the United States of America” in 1933, and it is fully liable and obligated by it under every venue of International Law.
            By the voluntary (and fraudulent) action of the Governors in 1933 acting to reduce the 50 States United to bankruptcy and redefining the de jure government as a “corporator” and imposing a debt-based private monetary system (see Clearfield Doctrine) the “United States of America” was able to derogate any claim of sovereignty possessed by the 50 States United and thereafter it cozily “redefined” the 50 States as its own corporate franchises. 
            The United States Attorney wishes the Petitioners and the Alaska Supreme Court to assume that because the 50 States lost their sovereignty the State Nationals aka (somewhat incorrectly) “State Citizens” also lost their sovereignty.  This is not the case.  Sovereignty derives from the Citizens, not from the State.  The United States Attorney has it backwards. The absolute sovereignty of the nation is in the people of the nation; (q.v.) and the residuary sovereignty of each state, not granted (or able to be granted)  to any of its public functionaries, is in the people of the state. (q.v.) 2 Dall. 471; and vide, generally, 2 Dall. 433, 455; 3 Dall. 93; 1 Story, Const. Sec. 208; 1 Toull. n. 20 Merl. Repert. h.t.
            Sovereignty is a property inherent in living Men and Women, an attribute of freewill.
To the extent that a State, a legal fiction, is said to possess “sovereignty” it is representing the sovereignty of its Inhabitants.  The representative of our sovereignty may fall or rise or be changed without impacting our sovereignty one iota, just as a lawyer may be retired or fall ill or be disbarred or otherwise be rendered unable to represent us ---the 50 States United could no longer represent our sovereignty in bankruptcy.  We, the Petitioners, are fully Sovereigns nonetheless, able to exercise our sovereignty as independent “states” via self-declaration and able to delegate portions of our inherent sovereignty to states and nations.
            Just as all granted Authority to Act that a government possesses derives from the Inhabitants, all Sovereignty similarly derives from the Inhabitants. 
            Americans are in a unique position in that “We” declared each one of us Sovereign on an international basis, and function therefore as “Heads of State” at International Law.  We literally and unquestionably possess equal sovereignty to the “United States of America” aka “…the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, et alia”
            Whether we consider “The Constitution of the United States of America” a commercial contract under Equity and Admiralty or a treaty under the Law of Nations or a Divine Compact under Divine and Canon Law, it is still in its nature a contract, and the Petitioners, unlike the 50 States United, are fully competent Sovereign Parties to it by subrogation and we have fully invoked our Sovereign Rights, as well as claiming remedy, cure, and due allegiance under contract.
 
 
 
Ground 18.  The subject matter jurisdiction claimed by Petitioners for the Alaska Supreme Court is right and proper; the Alaska Supreme Court is able to grant them Equal Protection under the law and is also competent to issue the Writ of Habeas Corpus they seek, and as a court of mediation and appeals it is able to hear all contractual disputes. 
 
            The Alaska Supreme Court is the only appellate court of mediation having domestic jurisdiction and being able under AS 22.05.010 (e) to grant the relief we seek: “The supreme court may issue injunctions, writs, and all other process necessary to the complete exercise of its jurisdiction.” Our proper access to Due Process was found available as an Original Application.
            The Petitioners have invoked the Doctrine of Equal Protection under the Law and specifically applied for protection of Writ of Habeas Corpus, asking that it be applied by our State Supreme Court under the same rules and  in the same manner and degree as it is administered by the Supreme Courts of the State of New York and the State of Pennsylvania, where the Writ of Habeas Corpus is granted to relieve any and all circumstance which restrains the Inhabitants  of those States in the enjoyment of their liberty and freedoms and not merely or only in the case of physical incarceration or as the result of prior court actions. 
            We are admittedly not appealing a prior case and are not currently prisoners and not acting in accordance with Alaska Civil Rule 86, but this is immaterial as we are not applying for the Writ of Habeas Corpus on the basis of Alaska practice and statute.  Equal Protection requires that we be enabled to access the same benefits and protections available to Inhabitants of other States.  As both the State of New York and the State of Pennsylvania enjoy significantly more liberal interpretation and application of the Writ of Habeas Corpus and offer decidedly more varied and comprehensive protection as a result, we have asked the Alaska Supreme Court to apply the Writ in this case in the same manner and under the same rules as it is routinely applied in those States.
            It has been implied by the United States Attorney that as this Petition addresses federal issues and Respondents, it should be addressed in Federal court, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a proposition that both the Federal court and the Petitioners deny. 
            The “US District Court” is a court of “special jurisdiction” operating and functioning as a foreign, undeclared, and statutory court of higher order but of the same basic nature as the “US Tax Court” and having similar jurisdiction established by treaty since 1933.  It is purely a corporate and administrative court having no legitimate claim to other jurisdiction. The “special jurisdiction” it claims is the administration of its own affairs, namely the prosecution of State Citizens and State Corporations and other entities that  run afoul of the federal government and  the federal regulations the US District Court administers.  It is not tasked or meant to be a court of mediation or appeals and does not necessarily understand or sympathize with Law as it is practiced in other venues. 
            It would be entirely inconsistent with its mission and with its jurisdiction and also in obvious conflict with its own nature and self-interest for the US District Court to seriously entertain any action against its own bosses, the Named Respondents. It would be illogical for the Petitioners to seek mediation at the hands of the US District Court and they note that the US District Court has repeatedly and honorably refused to hear similar disputes without going so far as to demonstrate the self-evident grounds for their informal recusal.
            From both sides of the jurisdictional issues, in what the Alaska Supreme Court naturally is--- a domestic appellate court of mediation, and what the US District Court is not---- the Petitioners maintain that they have identified the court having proper jurisdiction to act in their favor and grant the relief they seek.
 
Ground 19.  The Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus aims at protection of the property interests of the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, and the State of Alaska, and in and of itself inflicts no harm on the Respondents requiring any claim of “immunity”.   
 
             Petitioners are not alleging or asserting any control over the free speech or opinion or intrinsic right of the Respondents to vote according to their conscience, or to be in favor or against any aspect or portion of legislation; nor do we offer any opposition to their right to create legislation or the free exercise of their right to enact legislation as a principle inherent in their Office, nor do we offer any proposal to infringe upon these same rights and prerogatives possessed by the Respondents as living entities and Equal Sovereigns.
            Petitioners assert that The Constitution of the United States of America is a public contract entered into by corporate entities since 1933: the  incorporated States,  (improperly) exercising the Petitioners’ subrogated Authority, entered into contract with another corporate entity, the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam…..et alia” dba “US Corporation”.  The provisions of this clearly stated public contract are owed performance under contract from the Respondents, including good faith and due diligence.
            The offending provisions of the legislation the Petitioners have objected to, the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act (2012), infringe contractual obligations and guarantees already and clearly self-evident in The Constitution of the United States of America, specifically the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th and 14th Amendments contain elements willfully infringed by the Respondents.  These provisions represent the Petitioner’s material interests under contract, which the Respondents have agreed by contract to respect and honor with Due Diligence, Good Faith, and Full Service. 
            The personal opinions, motives, desires, judgments or beliefs of the Respondents are not at issue.  Likewise the prerogatives of Office possessed by the Respondents are not and never have been at issue.  
            What stands at issue are clear infringements of pre-existing contractual obligations.  By entering into the contract known as The Constitution of the United States of America the Respondents as well as the Petitioners have consented to its specific provisions, and no party to this contract is then at leisure to ignore or by stroke of pen invalidate these agreements, including the Respondents.
            Thus, the Respondents are not being limited in their free speech or their choices in any way.  The Respondents agreed to this contract, The Constitution of the United States of America, by their own hand; in fact, in its present form, the Respondents created, offered, and imposed upon the Petitioners to adopt this contract.  Having entered into solemn public contract by their own consent and by their own devising, promising to abide by and respect its provisions as a condition of their own Office and the existence of their “government” whether de jure or corporate, they are obligated to honor it. 
            Absent such respect of their contractual obligations, no viable contract can be said to exist between the Petitioners and the Respondents and the foreign government the Respondents represent.  It is not the intention or desire of the Petitioners to entrap the Respondents or to force them to provide the services described by this long-standing public contract or to compel them to act in compliance with its provisions, so long as the Respondents simultaneously and in public renounce their privileges, offices, rights, immunities, remunerations, and vacate all claims against the credit and property of the State of Alaska and the other 50 States United and all similar alleged property interest in the citizenry of the 50 States United, make whatever restitution can be made for their crimes, and also then promptly and permanently decamp from our shores.
            The Petitioners assert that the “United States of America” either has a contract with the 50 States United and by subrogation with us, or they don’t.  They either honor their contract or they lose it and its benefits.  The Petitioners are completely amenable to the severance described above and would be well-content to see the Respondents together with their employees relocated to Guam as their permanent and inviolable residence.
            Equally, absent objection by the other Parties joined by contract, these self-serving infringements and alterations proposed by the Respondents would stand by a process of legal presumption, such that the Petitioners would be harmed and condemned by their own inaction, and are compelled to act by necessity.  The State of Alaska has not thus far honored its contractual and fiduciary responsibility to act in behalf of the Inhabitant’s interests in this matter and has manifestly and repeatedly failed to secure contract enforcement, so the Petitioners have unavoidably invoked their Rights under subrogation and taken action in their own behalf to protect their threatened property interests and to seek a protective Writ of Habeas Corpus to forestall and prevent the most egregious results of the contractual infringements already enacted against them as legislation by the Respondents.
            Petitioners assert that the government represented by the Respondents, the “United States of America” defined as “…the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, et alia….”has exercised their credit and the credit of their State under conditions of gross fraud for almost 80 years, and has recently employed their own credit against them to prepare more than 800 internment camps under the auspices of FEMA, and that this same criminal government represented by the Respondents has with these same offending provisions of pretended “law” proposed to use our own military forces against domestic targets in overthrow of Posse Comitatus provisions of Public Law that have stood for over a hundred years. They have additionally armed and trained no less than 63 separate agencies of the “federal government” to undertake police actions against the Inhabitants of Alaska and the Inhabitants of the other States United. 
            Under such circumstance, Petitioners have every right and reason to expect that the Respondents mean them gross and irremediable harm, and that these Acts of Legislation, the Patriot Act and the offending provisions of the NDAA (2012) have been undertaken and passed in an attempt to “legalize” additional intended gross and non-contractual predations against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, the State of Alaska, and the other 50 States United and their Inhabitants.   
            The Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus under consideration does not offer in and of itself any action from which the Respondents may plead immunity or by which the Respondents may be adversely impacted.  Indeed, the issuance of a protective Writ of Habeas Corpus would serve to protect them as well as everyone else from unlawful detainment.  They need hardly seek “immunity” from protection of their lives and liberty. 
            The Petitioners offer this analogy:
            Some property owners, a husband and wife,  gave the keys to their house to a professional property manager with the understanding that the house and grounds were to be kept clean and maintained “as is” until the property owners returned from a trip.  Additionally, security cameras were to be installed including an extra set of security lights near the garage and the house and grounds were to be checked daily for any sign of illegal entry or vandalism.  The water and other utility bills were to be paid for by the property manager each month, out of a specified account containing sufficient funds to pay for an entire year of utility services.  Funds for incidental repairs and maintenance costs up to $10,000 were similarly provided.  The property manager was pre-paid for his services.  These elements of contractual agreement were set down in writing, the money was paid by the property owners for these services, and they went away on their trip without undue concern.
            When they returned a few months later they found their property in a state of ruin. The house and grounds had been allowed to deteriorate and go wild.  The rain gutters were clogged, the basement was decayed and flooded, the grass and hedges all overgrown; vandals had broken down the sturdy cedar fence surrounding the property, burned parts of it, and scribbled graffiti on the side of the house and broken windows and robbed the place at evident leisure. The new security lights were never installed and all utilities were turned off for lack of payment, the notice tags left hanging on the front door. 
            The stunned and outraged homeowners drove over to the office of the property management firm and found everything there in fine shape.  The manager they entrusted with their property had a new car and had expanded his business operation exponentially since they last saw him.  When they demanded an accounting from him, they discovered that both the utility account and the funds provided for maintenance were gone, and that the property manager had used his position of trust to rummage through their personal records, had stolen their identity, and had wildly exercised their bank and credit card accounts in his personal favor.
            Obviously, none of this is according to the contract they agreed to. 
            It is all criminal and profoundly illegal.
            The outraged property owners insisted that the property manager accompany them back to their ruined home site for a review of the circumstance.
            “We left here with a blossoming rose garden and nice hedges and a strong cedar fence and a secure home with beautiful furniture….” The property owners asked through tight lips, “Is this what you claim you have maintained under contract in “as is” condition?”
            “It depends on how you define “as is” …..” The property manager replied smoothly. “This is naturally how it is. You know the grass grows, the leaves fall, the rain comes down. That’s how it is, so, hey, it’s “as is” so far as I can see.   I didn’t do anything to harm your property.  This is the first time I noticed the fence and the graffiti and the broken windows.  As for the water in the basement, the utility company should have turned it off a long time ago. I can’t be held responsible for that.  I thought you understood that I’d be using your credit. You gave me the key to your house and access to all your records. I presumed that you would buy me a new car and authorize investing in my business, because, well, after all, you did sign a contract for services with me and nobody representing your interests objected.  So, it is your fault that things are the way they are.  You should have been more prudent and hired someone to keep me in compliance. You can’t expect the guys at my own firm to keep me honest.”
            The Petitioners’ “property” is derelict and abused, their credit has been exercised under conditions of fraud, their cash accounts and savings have been plundered, their jewelry, antiques, and family heirlooms have been stolen, and the provisions of their contract with the “United States of America, Inc” have been outrageously and self-interestedly misinterpreted and abused in front of the whole world.  The only thing in question is the end of the story.
            Will the “guys at my own firm” recognize the moral and legal necessity of defending the property owners from further abuse?  There are two possible endings to this tale:
            The property manager is prosecuted for his outrageous behavior and forced to honor every period and jot of the contract he signed, including restitution for all the damage he caused.  Unable to make such amends, he is forced to go bankrupt and sentenced to jail time for his crimes.  The guys at his firm side with the property owners and go on to run a legitimate property management business of their own.  The property owners rebuild their lives in peace, and life goes on for everyone concerned.  The whole debacle is handled responsibly and lawfully and with a minimum of destruction. Justice is done to the extent that it can be.  It’s all very unfortunate and deplorable, but survivable.
            The alternative is that the property manager drags out a forged Deed of Trust and pretends that he is the legal owner of the property.  He calls the police and has the real property owners thrown in jail, claiming that they have vandalized his property.  His own private for-profit court then sentences the property owners to life in prison at hard labor on suspicion of not liking him very much, and the profit from their labor is paid back to the property manager as restitution for the “vandalism” done to “his” property.   
            In this version, the guys at his firm turtle down and claim that they were just taking orders, apparently hoping that the Nuremburg Defense will work a second time around.
            While the original couple is imprisoned and starved in a detainment camp and forced to work as slave labor to support the property manager, other less civilized property owners who have been similarly defrauded and abused by him erupt in a blind fury. They fall upon the property manager, tear him limb from limb, and then proceed to tear down his office complex brick by brick. Seeing their opportunity, Mexican and Chinese and Russian enemies of the property manager get involved in the melee and show up, setting fire to the whole town. A vast amount of property is destroyed and untold numbers of innocent people are killed and injured.
            We must all decide which ending we prefer. The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, have taken the High Road and chosen the first option----determined, responsible, lawful joint action to enforce contractual obligations, uphold the rule of law, and forestall any further abuse of the victims at the hands of the so-called “United States of America”.
            The immediate action on the table is a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, to be extended to the “home owners” to protect them from being assaulted and illegally imprisoned by the “property manager” on top of all the other damage already done (and being done daily) to them by the foreign Commonwealth version of “United States of America” defined as “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, et alia….”
             If the facts and history presented to the Alaska Supreme Court as the Grounds of our Petition should prove to have sufficient merit to justify a referral of criminal charges against the contract-infringing Respondents and the corporate government they represent, the Petitioners would welcome such a result and find it expedient as a corrective measure, but the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus is what it says it is and should not be mistaken or purposefully misconstrued as anything else.
            The Petitioners are under threat of assault and indefinite physical detainment by a government entity that is in open defiance of its known and clearly stated contractual obligations, a government entity that the Petitioners have reasonable cause to consider both dangerous and criminal.
            The State of Alaska and the other 49 States United need to fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities and restrain the “federal government” from further abusing the Inhabitants, both in their own material defense and to avoid prosecution as accomplices to the broad crimes perpetrated by the “United States of America” , aka, “…the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, ….et alia.”           
            The first and most obvious step toward correction is to extend the requested protection of a Writ of Habeas Corpus, refusing to allow the federal government to enforce indefinite detainment without recourse to Due Process on Alaskans.
 
Ground 20:  The known Nature of the corporate government represented by “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, et alia….” calling itself “the United States of America” instituted circa 1933, is both criminal and violent, such that protection of the property interests of the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, and of the State of Alaska, is only responsible and prudent action.  
 
            In weighing and discharging all fiduciary responsibilities, courts and governments worldwide apply the Prudent Man Standard.  Prudent men or women do not give their house keys to a known burglar, expose their children to known pedophiles, or underestimate the potential violence of known murderers.  By the same standards, the State of Alaska Supreme Court and other State of Alaska Officials must assess the known character of the “United States of America” represented by the Respondents, and take action accordingly if their public acts are to be credible and deemed responsible.
            The “United States of America” represented by the Respondents, and defined as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, et alia, is a separate nation.  It behooves the Alaska Supreme Court to ask what manner of nation it is and to consider the facts known about it:
            It has for nearly eight decades kept the 50 States United in a perpetual state of fraudulently imposed bankruptcy, so as to undermine and deny them sovereignty.
            It has subsisted via the fraudulent exercise of the credit and substance of the (now) 50 States United and their citizenry.
            It has willfully sought to establish claims of slave ownership over Americans, so as to buy and sell their “value” as securities and as collateral for debt under the Buck Act.
            It has kept America in a nearly constant state of war for decades and is responsible for the deaths and sufferings and property losses of millions of people worldwide.
            It has run up astronomical, totally unsupportable levels of debt.
            It has created vast coercive self-interested regulatory control over the supply of virtually all commodities in America, including fuel, water, and food stuffs. 
            It has sold out American trade interests via GATT, CAFTA, NAFTA and made treaties to the detriment of American industry and business interests and the welfare of Americans generally.
            It has consistently allowed the devolution of American domestic infrastructure, such that our roads and bridges, railroads and port facilities are derelict.
            It has ruined public education in America; test scores have fallen every year since 1976, the same year that the federal “Department of Education” began operations.
            It has undermined the American monetary and banking system for private profit.
            It has run a de facto corporate government overseeing the 50 States United and established corporate State governments as municipal franchises in unlawful conversion of the Republican form of government guaranteed by The Constitution of the United States of America.
            It has installed a foreign undeclared statutory for-profit court system throughout America, seeking to commercialize crime and to profit from slave labor held in penal institutions paid for at taxpayer expense.
            It has self-servingly profited from domestic property seizures and from  the slave labor of over a million and a half Americans in jail for  so-called ‘victimless crimes’ related to regulatory “infractions” prosecuted as crimes without any lawful standing or corpus delecti.    
            It has allowed thousands of federal government employees to function as undeclared Foreign Agents, interfering endlessly with the internal domestic affairs of the 50 States United. 
            It has promoted, enshrined, and sustained a constant state of “emergency” and has kept entire generations of Americans from ever knowing peace or prosperity.
            It has repeatedly used deceitful lies as excuses to engage in war.  From the attack on Pearl Harbor that was known about for over a week in advance and not defended against, to the latest War in Iraq and the outright lies about non-existent “weapons of mass destruction”, this government has lied bald-faced to the American Public ad nauseum and split our blood and spent our public treasuries on war mongering for private gain.
            It has promoted and allowed foreigners to overrun our borders and have access to our public services because each new “United States citizen” amounts to more “property” under the Buck Act and nets approximately $6 million per person so enrolled as new slave collateral for debt.
            It has defrauded three generations of Americans via the improper imposition of the Federal Income Tax, falsely claiming that the Inhabitants of the 50 States are all “US citizens” and “tax withholding agents” and otherwise fraudulently asserting that their domestic incomes earned entirely within occupations of common right within the 50 States and apart from any federal jurisdiction are legally subject to an excise tax.
            Its attack dogs at the BATF have massacred innocent American civilians at Ruby Ridge, Waco, and elsewhere without being prosecuted, while agents of the Internal Revenue Service have bullied and  relentlessly extorted money and property under threat and color of law from the helpless American populace, and the cretins of the TSA have let Arabs walk straight through airport security wearing “habib” supposedly “out of respect for their culture and religion” while assaulting American grandmothers and manhandling dying cancer patients.  Still other agencies of the Federal government have taught local police forces in California how to gang up six-on- one and beat to death an unarmed mentally ill homeless man, and how to ignore the screams of a Redding, California, teenager being mercilessly gang raped in full view of the entire neighborhood. They have helped murder only God knows how many people by delivering thousands of automatic weapons to Mexican drug cartels at taxpayer expense and refused to protect or defend our nation’s Southern Border.
            It has carried out a criminal and well-organized program designed to entrap as many Americans as possible into making self-degenerating and self-defeating claims to the effect that they are “US citizens” so as to profit from them as “property” held under the Buck Act, traded as securities, and offered as collateral for the so-called “National debt” racked up by the “United States of America” defined as “…the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, et alia.”
            It has promoted and defended corrupt mortgage brokering practices, such that the banks have been allowed to charge 100% plus fees, plus interest for 30 years, plus insurance against mortgages that were immediately discharged by the banks under the provisions of Acceptance for Value as authorized by HJR 192. Millions of Americans have struggled to repay mortgages they never owed to banks who never gave them a loan, and millions more have lost their homes to these self-serving criminals in suits.
            It has subjected three generations of young men and women to “Selective Service”, and has wasted their time, their lives, their talent, their health, and their innocence on bestial foreign wars that have served only to benefit war profiteers and “defense” contractors.  
            It seized importunate power over the 50 States United under conditions of gross fraud and has worked unceasingly for nearly 80 years to enslave the Inhabitants of the 50 States United and to eat out the substance of the land and resources rightfully belonging to the 50 States and their Inhabitants.
            It ruthlessly confiscated privately held American gold reserves and provided no genuine remedy for the theft.
            It has held claims on the land and resources of the Western States including land and resources naturally belonging to Alaska, without any contractual authority to do so, and it has crippled industry and development in all the other regions of the country as a direct result.
            It has claimed ownership of our most beautiful natural settings and historical landmarks, and it has (1) set up for-profit theme parks based upon these resources, (2) offered these national treasures as collateral for their debts, and (3) sold interests in these national treasures to other foreign governments.
            It has instituted a fraudulent system of governmental bookkeeping identical to that used by Al Capone, implementing “two sets of books” beginning in 1946, and allowing the various units of government to cashier away and hide the existence of vast amounts of money in “investment funds” and “enterprise funds” controlled by political appointees and entirely outside the public budgetary process.
            It has sought to control and denigrate all aspects of our lives, from our birth to our death, from our citizenship to our medical care to our food resources, consistently acting in a predatory and self-interested manner seeking to reap profit from the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, through the abusive exercise of regulatory powers, fraudulent claims made against our body, our credit, our property, and our resources, extortion via taxation imposed by undeclared and self-interested statutory courts, and finally, purposeful inflation of the fiat monetary system illegally established on our shores ---all in flagrant opposition to the Respondent’s obligations under public contract and imposed by the Respondents as “legal tender laws”. 
            This same criminal entity calling itself the “United States of America” now stands poised literally on our doorsteps, ready to crash in, seize our property, and physically enslave us, using our own resources, our own military, and our own credit to do it, merely needing to claim that we are “terrorists” and are suspected of “belligerent acts” because we resist their pernicious lawlessness and demand that they respect their contractual obligations.
            The first, last, and only true legitimate occupation for any lawful government is to protect the property interests of the inhabitants, as that is the only reason any government has ever been instituted among us.   When the “government” instead becomes a predator against the property interests of the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, Natural-born State Nationals, owed good faith and full service under The Constitution of the United States of America, the “corporate government” represented by the “United States of America” is manifestly acting in a  criminal manner and must be willfully thwarted in its designs.
            The Governor of Alaska would not knowingly hand over his house keys to robbers. The Justices of the Alaska Supreme Court would not give their credit cards to known identity thieves.  In protecting the property interests of the State of Alaska and its Inhabitants, they owe no less common sense, due diligence, and prudence, when dealing with the “United States of America” and its Agents.   
            The Petitioners have invoked their Rights as parties to this contract under subrogation and have requested a protective order from the Alaska Supreme Court, a Writ of Habeas Corpus, which is the traditional remedy against all unlawful Bills of Attainder and Detainer.  In doing so they are seeking the protection of contractually guaranteed property interests and moving to prevent any further violence against themselves or the State of Alaska  initiated under color of law by the “United States of America”, aka, “…the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam….et alia.”
 
Ground 21:  A cold and disinterested reading of the offending provisions of the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act (2012) does not allow any popular “interpretation” presuming that these provisions will be administered only against the targets to which they are generally addressed and not applied specifically to Mom and Pop Americans. 
 
            The Law is meant to say what it says and not say what it doesn’t say.
            In other Grounds of this Petition, the Petitioners have addressed the fact that key terms and language constructions in both the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) are Void for Vagueness.  Now we come to the opposite necessity as well, that Law is required to forthrightly include or otherwise exclude its subject matter.   
            The Petitioners observe that while the offending provisions of the NDAA (2012) are carefully and intentionally constructed to give the impression that they don’t apply to rank and file Americans, they self-evidently do. 
            Anyone merely suspected of having committed an undefined “belligerent act” or of “supporting” enemies of the “United States of America” and its allies may be subjected to indefinite detainment (administratively imposed potential life imprisonment) without due process of law.   The victims of this lawless Act of Congress will be effectively silenced and unable to defend themselves.
            To this extent, these provisions say what they say, do what they do, and they cannot be glossed over or be presumed to be less offensive or less dangerous than they manifestly are.
            The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, are in clear and present danger. It is incumbent upon the State of Alaska in all its capacities to protect them and their property interests.
 
Ground 22:  Beginning in earnest in 1933, the “United States of America” has used every possible deceit of language and action to ruthlessly pursue its self-interested goals on one hand, and yet also excuse itself for responsibility for its acts on the other.  The offending provisions of the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) are no exception to the breed.  In addition to being Void for Vagueness in terms and construction and purposefully deceitful in declaring their subject matter, both these Acts of Congress obscure their capacity and applicability, such that these Acts are merely being presumed against the Petitioners.   
 
            The present imposition is similar to the Federal Income Tax, and the example it provides is instructive regarding all similar legislation being unlawfully presumed against the Petitioners.              The Federal Income Tax derives directly from the original Public Salary Act, which claimed that being employed by the “United States of America” was a “privilege” subject to an excise tax.   Congress acting as the government of the foreign Commonwealth nation comprised of  “….the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico….et alia” passed this tax against their own “US citizens” in their employ and against income from several specific occupations over which they exert regulatory control---alcohol, tobacco, firearms, etc.. 
            They have no granted Authority to enforce this tax against Citizens of the 50 States United living and working entirely within one of the 50 States in an unregulated occupation of common right, because The Constitution of the United States of America forbids interpretation of the right to work and earn a living in any occupation of common right as a “privilege” subject to an excise tax.
             Nonetheless, the “United States of America” has contrived to enforce the “Federal Income Tax” against virtually every American via a process of presumption and coercion.  By obscuring the dual role of Congress as both the despotic government of the Commonwealth nation called the “United States of America” defined as “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico Guam….et alia” and concurrently also the legislative branch of the government under contract established by the 50 States United, entire generations of Americans have been coerced and defrauded under color of law by the Internal Revenue Service.
            Congress simply (and quite legally) passes any arbitrary oppressive mandate it pleases in its capacity as the “government” of the Commonwealth nation also ---and with malice and deceit aforethought---called “the United States of America” and then its Foreign Agents presume it against American State Citizens.  The IRS presumes that we are all “US citizens” and/or that we are all in receipt of “effectively connected federal income” from designated “sources”.  Why else would we sign a 1040 and claim to be tax withholding agents under penalty of perjury? 
            The short answer is that we have been purposefully and self-interestedly coerced, defrauded, and subjected to extortion, lied to by undeclared Foreign Agents, and told that we “have to” sign up for Social Security and “have to” establish a “Taxpayer Identification Number” and “have to” file a 1040 by April 15th, etc.   Americans living and working entirely within one of the 50 States United in occupations of common right are not subject to this tax and they never have been. Yet millions of Americans have been methodically defrauded, suffered extortion, and been subjected to prosecution by presumption by the US Tax Court and the US District Court.   
            This why the IRS maddeningly describes the Federal Income Tax as a “voluntary” tax while they continue their predations throughout this once great country, bullying, burdening, and pillaging people they have no lawful right to address.   
            Generations of Americans, millions of hardworking, generous, honest people have been defrauded out of large portions of their income and have had their property seized under color of law and had their personal reputations dragged through the mud and many have served jail time for the “crime” of not paying a tax they didn’t owe to a foreign government.
            Congress acting as the legislative branch of the government established by The Constitution of the United States of America has no such coercive power to tax, to own slaves, or detain any American without Due Process of Law.  Congress acting as the legislative branch of the government of the “United States of America” defined as “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam….et alia” can do any despotic, immoral, crazy thing it pleases.  
            This brings us to the present case.  The Congress has no authority whatsoever to impose indefinite detainment without due process on any American State Citizen, including the Petitioners.  If the Respondents want to abuse and torture and detain “US citizens” living in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, et alia, the US Supreme Court has mistakenly given them the right to do so (Downes v. Bidwell) and has also given them the same importunate power over people merely living in their jurisdiction (Hooven and Allison Company v. Evatt)----howbeit, that jurisdiction has to be proven and once challenged cannot be presumed. .
            The only way that they can enforce indefinite detainment without due process against American Citizens within the 50 States United is by the same kind of presumption, deceit, and coercion that has allowed them to insinuate and enforce the “Federal Income Tax”.  It is venal in the extreme for any court to allow such Confusion at Law or to entertain any such presumption, and yet that has been the standard rather than the exception for the so-called “corporate jurisprudence” practiced in America since the Great Fraud. 
            Again, using the Federal Income Tax system as an example---the for-profit undeclared foreign statutory US Tax Court solicits the presumed taxpayer to “petition” it, presenting itself as a legitimate American Court. The trusting respectful people file the “petition” which gives the court jurisdiction.  Then the “US Attorneys” come in, also acting as undeclared Foreign Agents, and roll the victims, working hand-in-glove with the for-hire magistrate to do it.  They operate illegally with impunity right under our noses and within our borders and the State of Alaska does nothing whatsoever about it. 
            If the victims resist, they are kicked upstairs to the “US District” court, where the same travesty on a larger, higher scale plays out. The “US Attorney” comes in and without a word being spoken, the judge presumes against the person on the docket, presumes that they are a “US citizen”, presumes that they are guilty, and presumes a dozen or more other ugly things against them, which they are not even aware of and are not made aware of, even if they ask to be made aware of the cause and the nature of the proceedings against them.  
            It’s a foreign jurisdiction being run by a foreign government calling itself the “United States of America” operating according to foreign law and dictum, based on human slavery and Roman Civil Law, passing itself off as an American Court.   Let him who will be deceived, be deceived.  
            Many judges have felt constrained by their paychecks and by politics and have failed to live up to the high calling and moral responsibilities of their office, but the urgent need to do so now should be self-evident in these proceedings. The State of Alaska has “looked the other way” so often, so long, so determinedly, in regard to so many issues, that it amounts to an imprudent even suicidal habit, but despite any amount of denial, the fiduciary cows have come home. 
            A clear distinction must be made between those Acts of Congress that apply to “US citizens” endemic to the Commonwealth entity called the “United States of America” and other defined “Federal” jurisdictions, and those Acts of Congress that are undertaken under contract to the 50 States United, and by subrogation, to the Petitioners, which must conform to The Constitution of the United States of America. 
            In the absence of such clear declaration regarding the Patriot Act and the offending provisions of the NDAA (2012) the Petitioners must (and do) assume that it is the intention of the Respondents, Members of Congress, to use similar means and methods to “presumptively enforce” these acts which are lawful in their “other” Commonwealth version of “United States of America” as if they were also lawful in the 50 States United, which they clearly are not. 
            Petitioners are calling them on it straight out of the box and requesting a protective Writ of Habeas Corpus against the inevitable consequences of these unlawful usurpations and intolerable presumptions   
 
Ground 23:  In tandem with Ground 22, and related to the same Confusion at Law resulting from Congress “serving two Masters” as described above, undeclared Foreign Agents of the Commonwealth version of “United States of America” have worked assiduously to defraud State Citizens of their Natural Rights by importuning and coercing them under color of law and in ignorance to declare themselves “US citizens” when they are not “US citizens”, have never been “US citizens”, and as we demonstrated in other Grounds, cannot become “US citizens” absent a lengthy public process.  The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, have been subjected to grotesque predation at the hands of an entity owing them Good Faith and Full Service.  
            This effort to claim conversion of citizenship and to defraud the victims has been done in a wide variety of venues with the introduction of “certificates” and “licenses” and in relation to an extensive array of “federal” programs including Social Security, Internal Revenue functions, issuance of Passports and the like. 
            Typically, State Citizens have been presented with a single question on these documents:  “Are you a US citizen?”   In ignorance, under conditions of Non- Disclosure, given no other options, no explanations, and only two boxes to check, one labeled “Yes” and one labeled “No”----generations of Americans have said, well, sure, yes, I’m a US citizen. I’m not a citizen of Zimbabwe.  What do you think I am?  Check. 
            This has again allowed the foreign usurping Commonwealth version of “United States of America” superficial documentation for their presumptions needed to enforce non-contractual despotic rule over Americans, claim State Citizens as “property”, and by fraud, deception, and fraudulent claims of conversion obtain other improper derogations and advantages, most especially, it has allowed the “United States of America” to undermine and discount the sovereignty of the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, and served in many cases to render them impotent as Sovereigns in much the same way that the 50 States United have been deprived of their sovereignty by a fraudulently imposed bankruptcy. 
            The existence of such pervasive effort to obscure roles and identities, to coerce and importune people under conditions of non-disclosure to make self-defeating declarations against their Natural and advantageous Citizenship, and the self-evident deceit involved in employing one legislative body to run two dissimilar “governments” for two separate nations called by the same name: “United States of America”,  issuing legislation that can only apply to one of these entities as if it applied to both, the imposition of private undeclared for-profit statutory courts and widespread improper and unlawful enforcement of the laws of one entity against the actual citizens of another---presents a purposefully constructed morass of self-serving unjustifiable presumptions, fraudulent material claims, and gross criminal injustice.    
            There are actually, lawfully, very few “US citizens”, something less than half a million, most of them living offshore.  The rest of us are in truth American State Nationals owed every jot, line, and dot of every word of The Constitution of the United States of America.
 
Ground 24:  The gross criminal mismanagement of the 50 States United and the Dishonor of the contractual provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America by the Respondents, has led to an atmosphere of looming violence. The Respondents, Members of Congress, must be brought to the sharp realization that more victimization of the victims is not the answer----and won’t be allowed.  
 
            The Respondents can read the entire Constitution of the United States of America in less than an hour, and so can all the Foreign Agents in their employ.  It’s a simple straight forward contract for services.  That contract is the only reason the Inhabitants of the 50 States United tolerate the Respondents.
            Back in the day when the Respondents had a legitimate claim to exercise Our Sovereignty as a de jure government, they understood the nature of granted Authority and Sovereignty.  They had to.  By secretively overthrowing the de jure government in 1933 and overtly replacing the organic Constitution for the united States with the commercial contract known as The Constitution of the United States of America, they broke the chain of granted Authority and lost any legitimate claim of exercising Our Sovereignty.  By their own hand, they undermined the sovereignty of the States, so the States in turn had no sovereignty to delegate to the Respondents.
            With respect to us, Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, American State Nationals, the Respondents are now nothing more or less than a giant corporation (and its Officers) under contract with us and in our employ, which has run wildly out of control, Dishonored its contract with us, and embarked on a spree of war-mongering and oppression in our name and has done so via the fraudulent abuse of our credit. This same corporation now proposes to lock us up in concentration camps built with our own money and guarded by our own sons and daughters. 
            The Respondents need to be reminded of exactly who and what they are.  With respect to us, they represent corporate entities and the officers thereof, who owe us due diligence, good faith, and full service with respect to a commercial contract for services. That’s it.  All they have is a commercial contract to cling to, and they have dishonored that on an increasingly frequent and severe basis for eighty years. 
            The real Owners are here now, with their Allodium Title in hand, and eighty years of grudge for the abuse that their literal EMPLOYEES have done to them, their contract, and their property.  The corporate State of Alaska and the other so-called States owe fiduciary duty to enforce the contract, and if they should continue to fail to do so, the entire corporate government from top to bottom, front to back, will be shown up to the entire world as nothing more or less than a criminal syndicate operating lawlessly on our Shores.
            Both the Respondents and the State “governments” must hove to, get back to business, clean up their acts, stop the semantic shell games and other frauds and abuses, and meet their contractual obligations with respect to us, or face the fact that at the very least they will all be unemployed, criminally prosecuted, and disgraced on a worldwide basis. 
            Having been highly motivated to pursue this research, the Petitioners now realize that as declared members of a foreign government, that of the “United States of America” defined as “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam….et alia”, those Respondents who are Members of Congress are subject to extradition, and will likely make specious self-interested claims of diplomatic immunity if presented with criminal charges.  So be it.  Let them all save their hides and let us get on with rebuilding our country and our lives.
            Petitioners urge the members of the Alaska Supreme Court to recognize the extremely high stakes and inevitable consequences of these dire circumstances.  The State governments, if they act to protect the property interests of the Petitioners, may yet avoid international criminal prosecution despite their mammoth sins of omission.  If the State government acts responsibly to prevent the mortal endangerment of the Petitioners it may moderate the damages and bring about a peaceful and lawful resolution without blood in the streets and without inviting the enemies of America to feast upon our mutual remains. Nothing is more certain than that it is in everyone’s best interests for these issues to be resolved by legal mediation and that both versions of “United States of America” will be severely damaged or destroyed otherwise. 
            As for the perennial “bankruptcy” and the claims of debt promulgated by fraud and by obvious infringement of contract, it all needs to be cleaned up, swept away, and given a clean slate.  The nation of Iceland recently suffered similar predation by international banks, and has neatly rebuffed their claims and encroachments on their sovereignty.  Three years later, they now enjoy a much better economy, a solid banking system, good future prospects, and much international respect.  The 50 States United need to take their example to heart, justly claim that fraud was practiced against them by the “United States of America”, and similarly clear the decks, extricate themselves from condition of fraudulently imposed bankruptcy, and restore their own claim of  de jure status with the full support of the Petitioners.  
            The alternative is to sit back with the eyes of the world upon the 50 States United, and in equally clear view of the State’s own fiduciary responsibilities, allow the “United States of America” defined as “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam….et alia” dba  as the “US Corporation” to impose by presumption a self-serving police state in America.   The State governments would then expose themselves and their Inhabitants to senseless violence and unlawful predation similar to that experienced by Nazi-Era Germany, and the State governments will then, in that eventuality, stand fully liable for this consequence.  
            The internment camps are already built, the subcontractors hired to do the dirty work, Posse Comitatus is overthrown, and these unlawful Acts of Congress, the Patriot Act and the offending provisions of the NDAA (2012,) have been enacted against the States and the Petitioners. 
            The Respondents must be brought to heel, or war must inevitably begin, to the great destruction of the Respondents, the 50 States United, the so-called “United States of America” and the Petitioners. The Petitioners pray that the Alaska Supreme Court and the Executive Officers of the State of Alaska will embrace their unique fiduciary responsibilities and act promptly to protect the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, and their property interests.         
 
 
II. ADDITIONAL REMEDIES SOUGHT
 
            Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will require the United States Attorney to provide all due documentation needed to establish his standing, including naming non-attorney delegates(s) if corporate client(s) are being represented, together with the declarations needed to clarify and place all attorney-client relationships in the public record, and asks and seeks that the Alaska Supreme Court will otherwise bar the United States Attorney from participation in proceedings related to our Petition if he does not comply.
            Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will recognize that their method of providing Notice is both ancient and self-evidently effective, and will grant that as the Respondents in this case are both living entities and Officers of the Corporate Respondents, Notice given them as Principals serves a double duty, amounting to Notice given their Agents in both capacities.
            Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will recognize that the United States Attorney is thus far merely presuming an interest in our Petition and that in the absence of the documentation, declarations, and other elements necessary to establish his own standing he is imposing on the Court and on the Petitioners.
            Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will adopt those rules and conventions necessary to ensure Equal Protection under the Law and will accordingly apply the Writ of Habeas Corpus as it is administered in the States of Pennsylvania and New York, a claim duly seeded in our application but here restated for emphasis and specific notice as part of the remedy sought.  We are not applying under Alaska Civil Rule 86, nor are we applying under any federal court jurisdiction or under Federal Civil Procedure whatsoever. 
            The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will grant that Americans, also known as Natural-born State Citizens, have declared their Equal Sovereignty  on an International basis for over two hundred years as evidenced by The Declaration of Independence, The Treaty of Paris, and other Founding Documents.  They accordingly ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will agree that unequal sovereignty cannot be asserted as a credible issue and that in matters of contract dispute among equals there can be no “immunity” or claim of “non-consent”, as by entering the contract the Parties to it have unavoidably agreed to its obligations including their willingness to be sued for non-performance or subjected to demand for performance or relief from infringement.  
            Petitioners have exercised their Rights under subrogation to seek material relief from contract infringements enacted against them by the Respondents.  The Respondents cannot have it both ways----claiming that yes, we do have a contract and have the right to all the benefits thereof, but at the same time, no, we don’t “consent” to honor it and are “immune” from its obligations.  Either the “United States of America” has a contract and owes it due diligence, or it does not have a contract and needs to vacate our shores, a conclusion that the Petitioners ask and seek the Alaska Supreme Court to support.  
            The Petitioners are Equal Sovereigns owed Due Diligence and Good Faith under contract.  They ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will dispense with all self-serving claims to the contrary and hold the “United States of America” and other Named Respondents fully accountable for non-compliance and willful non-performance under obligation to The Constitution of the United States of America.
            The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, ask and seek the Alaska Supreme Court to assert its natural jurisdiction as a court of mediation and as an appellate court, able to hear and speak to any contractual dispute, and clearly able to issue the sought-for Writ of Habeas Corpus.  The Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will exercise the Power of Writ to protect Alaskans from the abuse of their most vital property interests---their lives and their liberty.
            The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will recognize that their pleadings have never advanced any arguments presuming to infringe the Respondents’ rights, abridge their free speech, exert control over their decisions, or limit the functions of their Office.  To the contrary, the Petitioners have sought the issuance of a Writ of Habeas Corpus that would serve to protect the property interests of the Named Respondents, Members of Congress, and “US citizens” generally along with everyone else.
            The Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will consider any disingenuous claim of immunity under the Free Speech provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America as an unnatural Red Herring “response” to an argument we haven’t made, a line of reasoning that is foreign and alien to any pleadings the Petitioners have presented.  There is no justification for the United States Attorney’s introduction of such issues and topics, aside from a self-interested attempt to muddy the water and mislead the court.  His “response” to non-existent pleadings may not be considered any part of what we have said or
done.  
            Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will move to end the deliberate Confusion at Law caused as a result of the Respondents, Members of Congress, acting  as the legislative branch of two disparate national governments both calling themselves the “United States of America”----one a Commonwealth entity comprised of “….the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico et alia” ----and the other the common government of the 50 States United established under the contract known as The Constitution of the United States of America. Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will require the Respondents to clearly declare in which capacity they were acting in passing the Patriot Act and the offending provisions of the NDAA (2012) and to force delineation of exactly what Authority the Respondents claim for these Acts of Congress and to plainly state whether or not they propose to enforce these Acts by presumption against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska.   
            Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will as an additional secondary remedy issue a Cease and Desist Order to the Respondents, requiring the cessation of their self-interested efforts to defraud the Petitioners and other Inhabitants of Alaska by misleading and importuning Americans, aka, Natural-born State Citizens, to claim that they are “US citizens” thereby rendering them vulnerable to enslavement under the Buck Act or to “salvage” under International Admiralty conventions.  These criminal and self-serving acts of the “United States of America” have served to cripple generations of Americans and to render them unable to represent their own sovereignty in the same manner that the “United States of America” has contrived by fraud to render the 50 States United disabled in this respect. 
            The Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will recognize the threat represented by the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012).  The “United States of America” is a foreign government acting as a corporation under contract to provide certain enumerated services for the 50 States United, and by subrogation, for the Petitioners. This Commonwealth version of “United States of America” has defrauded and oppressed generations of Americans.  It has undermined and crippled this once great nation, ruining its trade and infrastructure, reducing Americans to peonage and slavery and ignorance, fraudulently abusing our credit and the credit of our States, amassing a debt that is literally unimaginable, and   is now proposing to impose a police state, complete with concentration camps. 
            In the interests of Justice and Domestic Peace, the Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will act in their favor and issue the Writ of Habeas Corpus as requested.  Doing so harms none and protects all.  It is in the interests of all concerned to bring these issues to a peaceful and non-violent resolution.  The weeds will not survive the flowers. The same foreign interests responsible for the Great Fraud will not spare those they have used to perpetuate it.  The ironic truth is that the Writ of Habeas Corpus we request will shield the Respondents as much as it shields the Petitioners.
            Petitioners ask and seek that the criminality exposed as a necessary context for their Petition may not be allowed to detract from it or be presented as any cause to impede production of the requested Writ of Habeas Corpus. 
 
 
 III. CONCLUSIONS
 
            Petitioners have asserted that their time-honored method of giving Notice to Agents via Notice to Principals has self-evidently worked very well.  The only downfall appears to be that the United States Attorney has failed to establish standing despite receiving Notice, as he has not identified which entities he proposes to represent, hasn’t provided the documentation and other elements necessary to represent the corporate entities, and hasn’t actually declared that he is representing the living Respondents, either.  He has proposed to “Respond” and enter the proceedings via presumption that he has a valid interest in them, apparently on the strength of his title, “United States Attorney”, without even the nicety of telling the Court and the Petitioners which version of “United States” he proposes to represent. 
            Petitioners have asked that the court require the United States Attorney provide proper identification of his clients and documentation to establish his standing and a valid interest in the proceedings.  Petitioners have asked the Court to bar him from entering the proceedings if he does not provide proper identification, documentation including his Foreign Agents Registration Statement, declaration of attorney-client relationship(s), and, if he proposes to represent the corporate Respondents, a properly empowered non-attorney representative must be named and remain subject to cross-examination.  
            As an Opposition, the Petitioners have added additional Grounds to their Petition, answering, restating, and expanding upon topics raised by the United States Attorney.  They have done this in an effort to make all aspects of this action crystalline, so that there is no doubt whatsoever regarding their position and their petition, what they have argued in its favor, and what they have not argued. 
            Petitioners have argued that they are Equal Sovereigns (a point already asserted under Ground 13) and though the “United States of America” defined as “…the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, et alia” may claim sovereignty of its own, it may not claim greater sovereignty and may not claim that it has immunity from prosecution when it fails to meet the obligations it has freely accepted (and “consented to”) under contract. 
            By entering into The Constitution of the United States of America as a contract with the 50 States United and by subrogation with the Petitioners, the “United States of America” has agreed to its obligations vis-à-vis the Constitution of the United States of America circa 1933, and has also thereby consented to being sued or otherwise subjected to demand or petition against infringement when it fails to perform according to contract provisions that are clearly stated and which have been subject to adjudication for decades.
            Petitioners have stated, again, for the record, in separate Ground, that they are invoking Equal Protection under the Law, and asking that the Writ of Habeas Corpus be applied by the Alaska Supreme Court in the same manner as it is applied by the State Supreme Courts of the State of New York or the State of Pennsylvania, where the Writ of Habeas Corpus is issued as a protective order of the court whenever the freedom and rights of Petitioners are restrained or imperiled, and without regard for actual incarceration.   For the purposes of this action, the Petitioners have asked for the other State’s more liberal interpretation and application of the Writ, as they are already under restraint and threat of unlawful Bills of Detainer contained in the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012) and if they were to wait for incarceration under either Act, they would be denied due process and unable to apply for relief. 
            Petitioners have defended the jurisdiction of the Alaska Supreme Court as an appellate and domestic court of mediation offering the only apparent and proper venue for their Petition and they have also demonstrated the reasons why a federal jurisdiction for the “US District Court” is not a reasonable or proper option.  
            Petitioners have made it clear that they have never argued against the rights and prerogatives of the Respondents in any respect, and that they freely admit that the Respondents have freedom of choice, conscience, speech, and decision. The Petitioners have also not in any way sought to limit the Respondent’s exercise of the powers naturally inherent in their Office.  The idea that the Respondents would need to claim immunity under the Free Speech clauses of The Constitution of the United States of America in response to the Petitioners is ironic, foreign to our thinking, and vaguely ludicrous.
            The result of honoring our Petition would be to extend the protection of the Writ of Habeas Corpus to the Respondents and all “US citizens” along with everyone else.  The Petitioners are urging action that would in fact benefit the Respondents and serve to secure their personal safety.  Issuing the Writ of Habeas Corpus would provide a universal safeguard and immediately avoid the worst possible consequences of these legislative infringements against The Constitution of the United States of America for everyone concerned. 
            The Petitioners are not attempting to prosecute the Respondents via a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.  They seek the Writ in their own defense.  If criminal charges against the Respondents and the government they represent result as a secondary remedy, so be it, but the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus before the court  is what it is---a request for a protective order of the court which would equally benefit everyone concerned.
            The Petitioners have reviewed a variety of actions undertaken by the “United States of America” over the past 78 years to demonstrate the overt criminality of the federal government. Petitioners have done this to demonstrate in clear and uncompromising terms exactly why they have every right and reason to be alarmed and to feel threatened by the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012).  These are not actions taking place in a vacuum.  These are actions taking place in the context of a long history of criminal usurpation by the foreign federal corporate government and in full view of more than 800 FEMA concentration camps.
            Any presumption that the “United States of America” represented by the United States Attorney and the Respondents is an entity that can be relied upon to honor Law or contract or even the most basic property rights without determined enforcement stands denied by incontrovertible fact and eight decades of deplorable history.
            The “United States of America” represented by the Respondents has not hesitated to lay fraudulent claim against the credit of all 50 States United and their citizenry.  It has not scrupled about claiming “US citizens” as literal slaves and “property” interests.  It has taxed and defrauded three generations of Americans literally to death, and sent a great many of us to war to be killed, maimed, and physically and emotionally abused for the sake of its own self-interest and greed.  It has unarguably, and to the nth degree, disrespected the obligations of its public contract, The Constitution of the United States of America, and it has relied on its corporate franchise subsidiaries, the corporate “States”, to neglect-on-purpose their contract enforcement duties, thereby allowing the “United States of America” a free hand to defraud, extort, imprison, enslave, conscript, pillage, rob, detain, torture, murder and undertake other criminal acts against the Petitioners.
            Petitioners have maintained throughout that the State of Alaska is the entity bearing public fiduciary responsibility for enforcement of The Constitution of the United States of America and that all and any damage accruing to the property interests of the Petitioners, including their loss of life, liberty, land, home, and other losses resulting from the criminal and non-contractual activities of the “United States of America” in our State and on our Shores rests on the Offices and Officers of the State of Alaska; they are held liable as accomplices to crime to the same extent that they allow, aid, and abet the gross fraud and predation practiced against Alaskans by the “United States of America”. 
            Petitioners confirm that they are Natural-born State Citizens, Americans, Equal Sovereigns, and that they do not submit to the Dominion of the “United States of America”.  Petitioners firmly state that their only connection to the “United States of America” is as Sovereign Parties under subrogation to the public contract known as “The Constitution of the United States of America”. They adamantly assert that in the absence of this contract being fully honored and fulfilled by the Respondents, no valid contract between them and the Respondents can be said to exist and no lawful Authority to Act in their behalf or claim of any kind against them can be exercised by the Respondents.
            Absent scrupulous adherence to and fulfillment of The Constitution of the United States of America, this foreign Commonwealth entity merely calling itself the “United States of America” comprised of “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico…et alia” dba as the “US Corporation” has no rights, prerogatives, immunities, offices, or valid claim of any kind in respect to the Petitioners or the State of Alaska and all non-contractual actions undertaken by this entity can only be interpreted either as (1) not applying to and not being enforceable against the Petitioners, or (2) criminal acts aiming to harm the property interests of the Petitioners.
            Petitioners have demonstrated how this entity has self-interestedly abused its Public Trust in carrying out its operations within the 50 States United and how it has misled and deceitfully importuned millions of innocent Americans to make self-defeating and ignorant statements to the effect that they are “US citizens” when in fact they are not “US citizens” and never have been “US citizens”.  The Petitioners have asserted that this activity represents violent usurpation practiced against the Petitioners and their guaranteed property interests otherwise protected by The Constitution of the United States of America and is a purposeful effort to constructively defraud, meriting a Cease and Desist Order. The “United States of America” profits from enrollment of Natural-born State Citizens as “US citizens” as they may then be claimed as “property” under the Buck Act or as “salvage” under the conventions of International Admiralty Law.  They then also claim and exert coercive control over them as “wards of the state” at the federal level and continue to exact predation against them and their property.
            The abuse of our credit and the disrespect of our public contracts cannot continue without dire consequence for everyone concerned.  Left without remedy, there are 400 million fed up Americans and less than half a million “US citizens”.  As indicated by the existence of this petition, the Respondents are at a distinct disadvantage and the Americans have not really been caught sleeping. The most that can be alleged against us is that we have been docile, patient, generous, forbearing, peace-loving, and heroically tolerant for a very long time.
            The Petitioners have demonstrated the criminality of the federal government to give context to their Petition, but it is only secondarily a subject of their Petition, which is and remains a request for a protective order from the Alaska Supreme Court, specifically, a Writ of Habeas Corpus to prevent any presumptive enforcement and unlawful indefinite detainment of the Petitioners without recourse to Due Process, via Bills of Detainer enrolled as provisions of the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012.
