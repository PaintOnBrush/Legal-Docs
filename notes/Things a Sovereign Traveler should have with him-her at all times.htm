Is NOT engaged in any COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY that may properly fall under the limited ADMINISTRATIVE jurisdiction of your “law” enforcement authority (NOTE: The Motor Vehicle Code is not a CRIMINAL code and is (at best), ONLY applicable to commercially licensed taxis, transport/trucking companies, etc.in an administrative court of commerce.)</li></ul> <ul><li>B.

Driving is a legal privilege.Insurance, registration, emmisions are ALL legal things required by commercial drivers NOT travelers. NO state law can overrule or contradict that law and these decisions below by the Supreme court or the facts of law.The United States code plainly states what a “Motor Vehicle” is &amp; NO state has the right to interpret it differently. Nor, can they ignore, usurp, abrogate, nullify or overrule the U.S. Motor Vehicle Code &amp; it's definitions. Exactly what does the Constitution, supreme court decisions and U.S. Code say about the citizen's right to travel? Supreme Court Decisions which pertain to a Citizen's Right to Travel <ul><li>Thompson v. Smith 155 Va. 367, 154 S.E. 579, 71 ALR 604 (1930)“The right of a citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon in the ordinary course of life and business is a common right which he has under his right to enjoy life and liberty, to acquire and possess property, and pursue happiness and security. It includes the right in so doing to use the ordinary and usual conveyances of the day, and includes the right to operate an automobile thereon, for the usual and ordinary purposes of life and business. It is not a privilege, like the privilege of moving a house on the street, operating a business stand on the street, or transporting persons or property for hire along the street, which a city may permit or prohibit at will.”</li></ul> <ul><li>Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham 394 US 147 (1969) [not: 373 US 262(63)]“...our decisions have made clear that a person faced with...an unconstitutional licensing law may ignore it and engage with impunity in the exercise of the right...for which the law purports to require a license.”</li></ul> <ul><li>Murdock v. Pennsylvania 319 US 105 (1943)“A state may not impose a charge for the enjoyment of a right granted by the Federal Constitution.</li></ul> <ul><li>Kent v. Dulles 357 US 116 (1958)“The right to travel is a part of the 'liberty' of which the citizen cannot be deprived without the due process of law under the fifth amendment.”</li></ul> <ul><li>NAACP vs. Alabama 357 US 449 (1958)“Like the right of association [the right to travel freely] is a virtually unconditional personal right guaranteed by the constitution to us all.”</li></ul> <ul><li>Aphtheker v. Sec. Of State 378 US 500 (1964)United States v. Guest 383 US 745 (1966)“...a personal liberty protected by the Bill of Rights...Freedom of travel is a constitutional liberty closely related to the rights of free speech and association...the constitutional right to travel has been firmly established and repeatedly recognized...that a right so elementary was conceived from the beginning...In any event, freedom to travel throughout the United States has long been recognized as a basic right under the constitution.”</li></ul> <ul><li>Shapiro v. Thompson 394 US 618 (1969)“...freedom to travel is an element of the “liberty” secured by [the due process clause of the fifth amendment.]”</li></ul> <ul><li>A Constitutionally Guaranteed Right Cannot Be Converted Into A CrimeMiller v. US (5th Circuit) 230 F. 2d. 486 (1956) “The claim and exercise of a constitutional right cannot thus be converted into a crime”</li></ul> <ul><li>Miranda v.

Henkel 201 US 43 (1906)“...There is a clear distinction...between an individual and a corporation...The individual may stand upon his constitutional rights as a citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way...He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights. Upon the other hand, the corporation is a creature of the state...it's powers are limited by law.”</li></ul> <ul><li>Marbury v. Madison (1 Cranch 170) 5 US 137 (1803)“...a legislative act contrary to the constitution is not law...an act of the legislature repugnant to the constitution is void.”</li></ul> <ul><li>Norton v. Shelby County 118 US 425 (1886)“An unconstitutional act is not law...it imposes no duty...it is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed.”</li></ul> <ul><li>Staub v. Baxley 355 US 313 (1958)“...an ordinance which makes the peaceful enjoyment of freedoms which the constitution guarantees contingent upon the uncontrolled will of an official – as by requiring a permit or license which may be granted or withheld in the discretion of such official – is an unconstitutional censorship or prior restraint upon the enjoyment of those freedoms.”</li></ul> <ul><li>United States v. Jackson 390 US 570 (1968)“If a law has 'no other purpose...' than to chill the assertion of constitutional rights by penalizing those who choose to exercise them, then it [is] patently unconstitutional.”</li></ul> <ul><li>Evans v. United States 504 US 255 (1992)“[The] offense of extortion” was understood...[as] a wrongful taking under a false pretense of official right” [269] and citing</li></ul> <ul><li>White v. State, 56 Ga. 385 &amp; 389 (1876)  [270]“generically extortion is an abuse of public justice and a misuse by oppression of the power with which the law clothes a public officer.”</li></ul> <ul><li>Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition (1979) License (In re: Streets &amp; Highways): “The privilege of using the streets and highways by the operation thereon of motor carriers for hire can be acquired by permission or license from the state or it's political subdivision.”</li></ul> There are numerous decisions in state supreme courts throughout the United States on the right to travel. They all can be summed up best by the Virginia case: <ul><li>The United States code expressly defines the term Motor Vehicle:Title 18 U.S.C. § 31 (6)“The term 'motor vehicle' means every description of a carriage or other contrivance propelled or drawn by mechanical power and used for commercial purposes.”</li></ul> <ul><li>The Constitution for the United [Sovereign Republics] States of America Article VI paragraph II: “This constitution and the laws of the United States...; and all treaties made or which shall be made...shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any state to the contrary not withstanding...”</li></ul> <ul><li>";Statutes that violate the plain and obvious principles of common right and common reason are null and void."; Bennett v. Boggs, 1 Baldw 60.</li></ul> The Supreme Court says you DON'T need any form of “license” or pay any “fee,” to enjoy your “liberty” and your constitutional rights! <ul><li>Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 902 (3); Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 27 and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 44 (a)(2) &amp; (1991 Amendment) all deal with “self-authenticating documents,” acknowledging that they are legal and valid as evidence for the courts and other public offices.</li></ul> <ul><li>Any act to attempt to deprive a citizen of their constitutionally guaranteed rights is a direct violation of Federal Law. It is also a crime called a “felony:” Title 18 USC § 241 Conspiracy against rights, and § 242 Deprivation of Rights under color of Law. Civil damages: Title 42 USC § 1986 action for neglect to prevent; § 1985 Conspiracy to interfere with civil rights and § 1983 Civil action for deprivation of rights.</li></ul> ***Regardless of your professional training and/or personal BELIEFS regarding the “Motor Vehicle” regulations, your refusal to IMMEDIATELY RELEASE this private traveler and his property will constitute an UNLAWFUL ACT, rendering you PERSONALLY LIABLE to answer to such charges, for violation of Constitutionally protected rights.. In your official capacity as a police officer, you are legally PRESUMED TO KNOW  THE LIMITS OF YOUR LEGAL AUTHORITY.  Officers who commit Acts ultra vires, (i.e., under Color of Law – again, without proper legal authority) by law, cannot be provided legal representation by their enforcement agency. By this NOTICE, you are also hereby barred from raising ignorance of the content put forth in this NOTICE as an affirmative defense in  any subsequent legal or lawful proceeding. Beyond this, any unlawful Acts you may commit will likely subject your “law enforcement” employer to similar liability, financial damages and injunctive prohibitions for engaging in the systemic and willful and deliberate deprivation of this travelers' free, unimpeded use of the highways and free exercise of the Right To Travel. <ul><li>";With regard particularly to the U.S. Constitution, it is elementary that a Right secured or protected by that document cannot be overthrown or impaired by any state police authority."; Connolly vs. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 US 540; Lafarier vs. Grand Trunk R.R.
