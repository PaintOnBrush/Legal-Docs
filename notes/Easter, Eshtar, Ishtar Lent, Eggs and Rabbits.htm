In examining history we find the answer to very old questions surrounding Easter, Easter 
eggs, rabbits, and lent. Rabbits do not lay eggs. To discover the truth we simply examine
similar more ancient tales. There is also much insight to gleen from these stories into
modern day events that do not seem quite right. The story of Easter and the tradition
observed even today, is identical to traditions observed in the ancient past by our
Sumerian, Akkadian, Phoenecian, Babylonian,  Egyptian and Roman ancestors. Easter sunrise
service, passover, marks the transition of longer days and the revitalizing conditions of
spring.
Babylon
Arabic: Babil;
Akkadian: Bābili
Sumerian logogram:
Hebrew: Bābel
Babylon was an Akkadian city-state founded circa 1867 B.C. by an Amorite dynasty of ancient
Mesopotamia, the remains of which are found in present-day Al Hillah, Babil Province, Iraq.
All of which remains of the original ancient famed city of Babylon today is a mound, or
tell, of broken mud-brick buildings and debris in the fertile Mesopotamian plain between
the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The city itself was built upon the Euphrates, and divided
in equal parts along its left and right banks, with steep embankments to contain the
river's seasonal floods.   Hittites Sacked Babylon and Kassites renamed the city of Babylon
Karanduniash.
Semiramis
Eshtar
Ishtar
Ishtar was goddess of Babylon said to have fallen to Earth from the moon in a colorful Egg
which crashed into the Euphrates River and that her “birth” took place at the time as the
first full moon after the spring equinox. Semiramis became known as “Ishtar, or Eshtar”
which is now “Easter,” and her moon egg became known as “Ishtar’s egg, or an Easter egg.”
This is where the central theme of eggs originated in connection with the Easter
holiday.The word easter is actually a derivative of the word “Ishtar,” which was a day on
which many people who practiced pagan religion commemorated the resurrection of one of the
gods they worshiped, named “Tammuz, son of Ishtar or Semiramis.” This god was believed to
be the offspring of their moon-goddess and sun-god.
Babylon: Tammuz was the son of Ishtar of Babylon. The  bears a similar story to
Egypt: Osiris
Greece: Adonis
Daonus or Daos, the shepherd of Pantibibla";, referred to by Berosus as the ruler of one of
the mythical ages of Babylonia Tammuz is slain by a wild boar, and his blood fallson the
stump of an ever green tree which fully grows into a new evergreen tree over night. Ishtar
mother of Tammuz declares a 40 day period of morning where it is forbidden to eat meat in
honor of the fallen hunter, who consequently happened to be quite fond of rabbits.
Tammuz of the Sumerian hymns, however, is the Adonis-like god who lived on earth for a part
of the year as the shepherd and agriculturist so dearly beloved by the goddess Ishtar. Then
he died so that he might depart to the realm of Eresh-ki-gal (Persephone), queen of Hades.
According to one account, his death was caused by the fickle Ishtar.
Traces of the Tammuz-Osiris story in various forms are found all over the area occupied by
the Mediterranean or Brown race from Sumeria to the British Isles. Apparently the original
myth was connected with tree and water worship and the worship of animals. Adonis sprang
from a tree; the body of Osiris was concealed in a tree which grew round the sea-drifted
chest in which he was concealed. Diarmid concealed himself in a tree when pursued by Finn.
The blood of Tammuz, Osiris, and Adonis reddened the swollen rivers which fertilized the
soil. Various animals were associated with the harvest god, who appears to have been
manifested from time to time in different forms, for his spirit pervaded all nature.
Tammuz in the hymns is called ";the pre-eminent steer of heaven";, and a popular sacrifice
was ";a white kid of the god Tammuz";, which, however, might be substituted by a sucking pig.
Osiris had also associations with swine, and the Egyptians, according to Herodotus,
sacrificed a pig to him annually. When Set at full moon hunted the boar in the Delta
marshes, he probably hunted the boar form of Osiris, whose human body had been recovered
from the sacred tree by Isis. As the soul of Bata, the hero of the Egyptian folk tale, 1
migrated from the blossom to the bull, and the bull to the tree, so apparently did the soul
of Osiris pass from incarnation to incarnation. Set, the demon slayer of the harvest god,
had also a boar form; he was the black pig who devoured the waning moon and blinded the Eye
of Ra
In biblical times, there was a man named Nimrod, who was the grandson of Noah’s son Ham.
Nimrod married his own mother and became a powerful king. In fact, the people over whom
Nimrod ruled elevated him to the status of “god-man.” His wife and mother, Semiramis,
became the powerful queen of ancient Babylon.
