Case No. S14542
 
ADDENDUM TO PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
Additional Grounds in support of Petition:
In addition to the grounds already submitted in support of our Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus submitted December 20, 2011 and originally December 8, 2011, Petitioners would like to add the following new grounds and information in support of our petition:  
Ground 10:  Since the enactment of the Patriot Act as Extended and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, another powerful Act of Congress seeking to undermine and derogate the Petitioners’ Right to Contract has been moving through the Committee process in both Houses of Congress:  S. 1698 and HR. 3166, known as the Enemy Expatriation Act. The existence of this incipient Act of Congress is further proof of coordinated, conscious conspiracy against the guaranteed property interests of the Petitioners.  
The Enemy Expatriation Act seeks to codify the already administratively realized undermining of the Right to Contract embodied in the Patriot Act , and specifically attacks the Petitioners’ right to establish citizenship  by natural or legally assumed contract .
The purpose of this legislation as stated by the sponsors and co-sponsors is:  “To add engaging in or supporting hostilities against the United States to the list of acts for which United States nationals would lose their nationality.”
This legislation is Void for Vagueness and potentially subject to abuse due to lack of strict construction and reliable definition of words and terms, very similar to the same problems noted with the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012) already addressed as Ground 6.   Just as the Patriot Act leaves “terrorism” undefined and NDAA (2012) leaves “belligerent acts” undefined, the Enemy Expatriation Act neglects to define what constitutes an act “engaging in or supporting hostilities against the United States”.   
Is a child name-calling in the street engaging in “hostilities against the United States”?    Are we engaging in the same when we submit this Petition?   The proposed legislation continues the repugnant effort to codify infringements against the Petitioners’ guaranteed property interests, and provides more proof by its content and existence that we are being subjected to a coordinated and purposeful attack.
Both the offending passages of the NDAA (2012) and the offending passages of the pending Enemy Expatriation Act, seek to codify and make permanent the administrative emergency powers embodied in the Patriot Act that were never proper in the first place, but which they have sought to establish by a process of “emergency rules” and presumption against the Petitioners and other Inhabitants of Alaska.
The Petitioners’ Right to Contract is the necessary bedrock underlying the American government at all levels. State and the Federal governments both depend on the Petitioners’ Right to Contract for their existence and it is also the basis for any claim that government possesses “granted Authority to Act”. 
There is no Authority vested in Congress to by fiat deny the citizenship of any Natural born American or “US citizen”, for the very good reason that it would leave the right to contract vulnerable and subject to political whim, which in itself would serve to undermine and destroy the basis of American government. All that we said on this subject in regard to the usurpations presented by the Patriot Act are magnified, codified, and will be made permanent with the passage of the Enemy Expatriation Act.
The seriousness of this issue can hardly be overstated.  Since the Hooven and Allison Company v. Evatt Supreme Court decision in 1901, the federal government has relied in ever-increasing degree on extending its jurisdiction and expanding its material claims upon “US citizens”.  While the Petitioners do not approve of this practice and do not find legal merit in the claims being made based upon it, the situation does neatly illustrate the interlocking relationship between the Right to Contract with respect to citizenship allegiances and the material well-being of the government. 
The Founders were acutely aware of this relationship between the Right to Contract as it applied to citizenship and the impact of this particular contract on the government.  The controlling Statute at Large defining the process of becoming a  “US citizen” was passed April 14, 1802, 2 Stat. 153, c. 28, ss 1, Rev. Stat. 2561. In this process, a State National, already possessing Citizenship within one of the 50 States, agrees to undertake the obligations of “US citizenship”. This mandates among other things, a two year period of formal Declaration of Intent, maintenance of a residency requirement, good character, a public oath of allegiance and equally public renunciation of any other allegiance, all recorded in a Court of Record.  Clearly, the contract between a citizen and a government is of the most serious nature possible, requiring voluntary, sober, and prolonged consideration and intent, public recording, and consciously recognized obligations of allegiance.
We can think of only one other contractual process requiring similar duration of intent, exhibition of good character, and determined public action, and that is the somewhat similar process of Naturalization, which additionally includes educational requirements. 
A government is only as good as its citizens. We know that the stability, health, intelligence, character, and strength of a nation is a direct reflection of its government, and government  is in turn a direct reflection of the those same qualities possessed  or lacked by those inhabiting that government.  Instead of the common political assumption that citizens represent a population to be served and swayed, citizens are in fact the substance of both the government and the nation.  They determine the existence of the government, and by their allegiance they morally and materially sustain the government.  As a result, governments have an avid self-interest in securing the highest quality citizens possible, in promoting their education, in earning their loyalty and in promoting their prosperity----which of course, the government is eager to share in the form of taxation, fees, investment funds, and enterprise projects. 
This ideal of an enlightened and self-interested government which sees its own welfare best represented by an enlightened and self-interested citizenry is a uniquely American concept, one which we have codified in our laws governing citizenship requirements, and which works admirably well so long as the government continues to earn and deserve the allegiance of its citizens.
From this perspective, a government that fails to protect, advance, and earn the allegiance of its citizens has already failed as a government.  No verbal or legal action undertaken by any citizen in response can add to this failure which the government has created and allowed by its own acts. 
The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 were very similar to these present Acts of Congress.  They were comprised of four separate actions.
Naturalization -- Extended the duration of residence for aliens to become citizens from 5 to 14 years.
 Alien Act -- Authorized the President to apprehend and deport resident aliens considered ";dangerous to the peace and safety of the US.";
 The Alien Enemies Act -- Authorized the President to apprehend and deport resident aliens if their home countries were at war with the US.
Sedition Act -- Made it a crime to publish ";false, scandalous, and malicious writing"; against the government or certain public officials.
The 1953 McCarthy Era Sedition Act was arguably the most shameful piece of legislation in the history of our nation, allowing the long, bitter, ugly persecutions, trials, and public hearings that now make us cringe. 
Twice before in our history Congress has attempted these forms of legislation and twice before they have been struck down.   How many more times must Americans go through this process?   Such legislation was wrong in 1798.  It was wrong in 1953.  It is still wrong now.    
There is still no Authority vested in Congress under any public contract that would serve to allow the Respondents to entertain such an usurpation against the Petitioners, and as we have demonstrated, plenty of precedent proving that there is not, and yet, by improper presumption, such Authority is asserted again by both the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) and is incipient in the Enemy Expatriation Act. 
Petitioners cite this latest offer of encroachment against their guaranteed rights, the Enemy Expatriation Act, as evidence in their favor and in support of their assertion that a Writ of Habeas Corpus is both appropriate and necessary as a safeguard for their liberty in a circumstance wherein they are threatened by a coordinated effort to undermine their most basic rights and freedoms. 
The unlawful Bills of Detainer in the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) are infringements related to the infringement being offered by the Enemy Expatriation Act, which is an attempt to codify the attack against our Right to Contract first asserted by the Patriot Act.   These are coordinated actions undertaken by Members of Congress, all of which propose to infringe upon the contractually guaranteed rights of the Citizens and which serve to undermine the lawful basis of American government.
Ground 11:  These Acts of Congress are being pursued to codify and enroll “emergency” powers on a permanent basis, when no emergency exists and when no major attack of any kind has taken place for over a decade.  Petitioners assert that there is no valid reason why these supposedly “temporary emergency  provisions”  are being prolonged and codified long after any valid state of emergency can be said to exist, and so must assert that the Respondents, Members of Congress, are attempting to erode the basic property interests of the Petitioners by presumption and usurpation.
 It is questionable that such powers should have ever been allowed an American President, under any circumstance, emergency or otherwise.  America has seen far more disruptive and dangerous events than anything that happened in March of 1933 or on September 11, 2001, without allowing those possessing only delegated authority to derogate and disrespect the basic rights of Americans.
Petitioners assert that these infringements are dangerous and indicative of a developing police state that will, if allowed, present a clear and present danger to the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, in excess of any threat that the members of the Taliban could have ever hoped to inflict.  The lack of any credible justification for prolonging much less codifying these “emergency” provisions after ten years without major incident and with peace talks underway with the Taliban, is more proof that these acts are merely attempts to make permanent encroachments against the rights and other property interests of the Petitioners. 
Similar “emergency” infringements against the basic rights of Citizens were undertaken by the National Socialist Party of Germany following the Reichstag Fire. It resulted in the purging of all counter-balancing elements in the government, the gross empowerment of a charismatic leader, suppression of all property interests and personal liberties, domestic genocide, and a headlong rush into devastating war.   America has similarly suffered a politically motivated and largely symbolic attack followed by ill-conceived legislation granting unbridled executive powers to a charismatic leader set against a backdrop of looming war in the Middle East. 
The Petitioners see the issuance of a  Writ of Habeas Corpus as a first logical step in the process of rational response against irrational claims of dictatorial government empowerment.  
 Ground 12: These Acts of Congress are in direct violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the United States supported and signed and is obligated to support.  
 These Acts of Congress, the Patriot Act, NDAA (2012), and the pending Enemy Expatriation Act, all serve to derogate the Human Rights of the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  The United States signed this UN Declaration in 1948 and is still obligated to honor its provisions. In tolerating and in enacting these offensive laws, the Respondents are acting in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in obvious disrespect of International Law, -----specifically quoting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
Article 8: Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law. 
Article 9: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.
Article 10: Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.
Article 11(1):  Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defense.  (Petitioners have argued in other Grounds that there is no rational basis for distinguishing between an act of terrorism and any other crime.)
Article 12:  No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.
Article 15(1): Everyone has the right to a nationality. (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality.
Article 17(2): No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.  (Petitioners reflect the judicial rendering of rights, immunities, and freedoms as property interests under contract.)
Article 30: Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein.
A fair reading of the language, intent, and consideration of the affects of the Patriot Act, National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, and the pending Enemy Expatriation Act, clearly shows the purposeful, blatant, and malicious intent to deny, derogate, and undermine one after another of these provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
As a tag team of interlocking and fully codified Acts designed to intimidate, suppress, oppress, and deny Human Rights to Americans, these three Acts of Congress are outstanding in their efficiency and broad in their reach.  Petitioners could only wish that the Respondents, Members of Congress, were half so talented and avid in defense of inherent rights, immunities, and freedoms as they are eager to oppress, intimidate, defraud, and betray the property interests of the people they are supposed to represent and the public contract they are obligated to uphold.
In full view of the mutually supportive elements actually present in the three referenced Acts of Congress, there can be no doubt that they are the product of a purposeful, coordinated, intentional, and premeditated effort to codify infringements against rights that are not subject to derogation.  These Acts were created, compiled, and advanced for the specific purpose of undermining the Petitioners’ Right to Contract and Right to Due Process and they materially  represent the existence of a prima facie conspiracy against The Constitution of the United States of America.
The offered destruction of the Petitioners’ Right to Contract and Right to Due Process as guaranteed to the Inhabitants is profound, and the existence and content of the third element of related legislation, the Enemy Expatriation Act, serves to prove that the presented Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus is an appropriate first step toward restoring the legitimate contractual boundaries imposed on our government(s) by The Constitution of the United States of America and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Ground 13:  Respondents are lacking any basis of Authority to Act.  Petitioners initially cited the Respondents’ lack of granted Authority under Commercial Franchise and Admiralty Law in the absence of contract fulfillment owed to all Natural born Foreign State Inhabitants of Alaska, aka “Americans” and then also due as an equal Civil Right to all US citizens.  Petitioners have since polled the Oath of Office for each one of the State of Alaska officials granted Notice of Dereliction of Duty and Demand to Show Cause, and also the similarly Noticed Respondents, Officers of the US Corporation, Members of Congress, under process of Quo Warranto. 
As a result of the Petitioners’ examination, they assert that the Respondents have no Authority over Americans under Canon Law, and that all their possible recourses to claim Authority for the offending portions of the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) are demonstrably exhausted. 
The Respondents’ Oaths cannot be taken under Canon Law if they claim to represent the 50 States United, and that is without exception.  Their deficiency under Commercial Franchise and Admiralty Law and their inability to claim granted Authority with respect to the offending portions of the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012) has been abundantly covered in other Grounds of this Petition.  They are similarly deficient with respect to The Declaration of Independence and the present Constitution of the United States of America under Canon Law, the third and last possible source of Authority that could be invoked. 
America is clearly a Protestant State under Canon Law, openly declaring the “equality of all” and thus specifically denying the possibility of any Office of government requiring a Public Oath under submission to Divinity.
The chronic abuse of Authority in respect to the Petitioners, who are living entities, whose flesh lives and whose blood flows, who are sovereigns under Divine Law equal to any other,  granted equal Dominion by God, and who admit no barrier between themselves and the Divine, Natural born Inhabitants of the 50 States, by the Respondents, Officers of the US Corporation, Members of Congress, is reprehensible and deeply repugnant to their presumed and professed Office, which has often been grossly misrepresented through purposeful semantic obfuscations.  
Let us quote the Congressional Oath confirming submission to Divinity: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.”
This is the only Congressional Public Oath.  It invokes Divinity, and it is not taken to The Constitution of the United States of America.  It is taken to the “Constitution of the United States”, representing, as we shall see, a different document and a different “United States of America”.
The Respondents’ chronic abuse of the property interests of the Petitioners has finally resulted in direct threat to the Petitioners’ lives and liberty, whereupon the Petitioners ask---Quo Warranto?
Not Divine Authority, for that would have to be invoked via the Respondents’ Public Oath of Office, and for that Office representing the interests of the 50 States United.  No such Oath can exist, because the 50 States United established a Protestant Republic that admits no such elements of “Rule by Divine Right” and instead declares the equality of all.  
The Respondents’ Oath quoted above, and often, their Public Office, has been openly, fraudulently, and flagrantly misrepresented for years at a time prior to this, as if it were the 50 United States the Respondents represent when taking their “Oath of Office”, and as if the “Constitution of the United States” to which they take this Oath were the contract known as “The Constitution of the United States of America”.
Petitioners submit that the Respondents, Officers of the US Corporation, Members of Congress, have inherited a number of Offices, in relation to two or more groups of “states” and corporate bodies, specifically, the Respondents have de facto rule over the District of Columbia, Guam, and other Territories, which are known as the “United State of America” as per the distinctions made in the Alaska Omnibus Act and as documented in Downes v. Bidwell, Hooven and Allison Company v. Evatt, and elsewhere. 
This second version of “United States of America” is distinct from the common understanding of the 50 United States of America, and also distinct from the “United States of America” defined as a “federal corporation” at Title 28, 3002, 15 (A) (B) (C). The Respondents commonly make use of this semantic mélange of “United States of America(s)” and all the related Offices to purposefully misrepresent the capacity in which they are acting at any given time, resulting in public confusion which has been turned to self-interested and fraudulent misrepresentations, omissions, and avoidances under contract, as in the present case.
The Oath of Office offered and widely assumed to be the Oath associated with the Respondents’ Public Office representing one of the 50 States United, is the only recorded and public Oath of Office that the Respondents have taken under Canon Law, and it is made in their capacity as de facto rulers of the “other” version of “United States” ----the District of Columbia, et alia,----as shown by the reference to the “Constitution of the United States” which is, as is clearly stated, a separate document and not, “The Constitution of the United States of America.” 
In the absence of a Public Oath submitted under Divinity there can be no recourse to Divine Law as the basis of any asserted Authority. The Respondents have no known Public Oath submitted under Divinity associated with their Public Office with respect to the 50 States United, nor, as proven by the Declaration of Independence can there be any such Oath of Office taken under principle of Divine Right.
No recourse to Canon Law as a source of Authority for Acts of Congress affecting any of the Inhabitants of the 50 States United,  known as “Americans” can be justified.
What is owed to Americans generally is also then specifically owed to “US citizens” under the provisions of the 14th Amendment and the advancement of equal “Civil Rights” and to all Non-Foreign citizens as Human Rights protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  No matter how the Respondents propose to interpret their authority under Canon Law with respect to US citizens, any unequal and deleterious impact must be contravened as disrespect of pre-existing contract. 
Thus, there is no granted Authority in any kind available to the Respondents to justify the presumptions made against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, by the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012).  The Enemy Expatriation Act, if passed, would be similarly lacking.  
In the absence of Honor, there is no Authority.  In the absence of both Honor and Authority, there is no Law.  
All three crowns are Dishonored by these Acts of Congress in the matter of Holy Contract, for those subscribed, and for those Inhabitants who are not “US citizens”, but Americans of a different Stamp, no jurisdiction at all can be claimed in the absence of contract fulfillment, thus rendering the offending provisions of both the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) void at Canon, void at Admiralty, void at Equity, and respectively, void without jurisdiction.   
No form of election can satisfy these reproofs; only Cause, Unction, or Treaty may be offered, in the absence of which, Petitioners maintain that issuance of a protective Writ of Habeas Corpus is the only sure means of preventing Miscarriage of Justice in Impietatis Templum Regis. 
Ground 14:  These public Acts of Congress are in violation of Federal Code, per Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 115, Section 2384:
“If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.”
Both these Acts of Congress, the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012)  were pursued entirely within the confines of Washington, DC, a locale that is unquestionably “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” defined as the states of the District of Columbia, Guam, et alia, and have equally worked to overthrow it and the Government of that other “United States” represented by the 50 States United.
Whereas judicial error first promoted in Downes v. Bidwell has freely allowed the Respondents, Members of Congress, importunate rule over the “United States” defined as the District of Columbia, et alia, no such rule is accorded to them under The Constitution of the United States of America contract such that both forms of “Government of the United States” stand threatened by their unlawful presumptions, as witnessed by the 14th Amendment and otherwise.  
Petitioners assert that two or more Respondents, Members of Congress, conspired to overthrow the basis of the lawful “Government of the United States” as defined by the Government of the 50 States United by attacking the Right to Contract, and that they also therefore effectively undermined the basis for the existence of the “Government of the United States” as defined by the Government of the District of Columbia, et alia, which equally depends upon the Right to Contract for its existence.
The District of Columbia was created by agreement among the several States.  It can be dissolved by agreement among the States and returned to the natural properties and ownerships from which it was derived.  Similarly, none of the other “states” said to be in “union” with the District of Columbia are related to it by anything more or different than a contract. 
We have a situation in which the tail not only proposes to wag the dog, but proposes to run the whole dog under the bus.
In this instance, no matter how the Respondents propose to define “Government of the United States” or which “Government of the United States” they invoke, no such entity exists apart from the Inhabitant’s Right to Contract and in the case of the District of Columbia, et alia, the Right to Contract Under God,  such that in any case, the Respondents actions in promulgating and seeking to enforce the offending provisions of the Patriot Act amount to Seditious Conspiracy against the defined “Government(s) of the United States”. 
Petitioners insist that they are living entities, the flesh lives and the blood flows, and that those of us so claiming are sovereign, admitting no barrier between ourselves and the Divine, granted EQUAL dominion under God, such that our Right to Contract is our immutable and necessary property interest, without which no “government” can be established or upheld under Canon Law, Admiralty Law, or Law of Equity. 
Absent the freely exercised Right to Contract no valid “Government of the United States” can be said to exist in any form.  All of the entities invoked devolve and become uninhabitable legal fictions absent the Right to Contract, even if that Right is limited to contract(s) with the Holy See in the case of the District of Columbia, et alia.  The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, represent living entities possessing varied status and allegiance, as Natural-born Foreign State Citizens or “US citizens” or “Non-foreign” Inhabitants, and as possessing Natural Rights and Civil Rights and Human Rights respectively, all of which are equally offended by these infringing Acts of Congress.  Petitioners also insist that all forms of “Government of the United States” stand equally threatened by these attacks against the Petitioners’ Right to Contract.    
Faced with such a bizarre circumstance in which the Respondent Officers of “Government of the United States” however so defined seek the annihilation of the basis of the government(s) they represent, the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, assert that the Respondents are undermining the Petitoners’ Right to Contract as evidenced by their citizenship, and are effectively acting to overthrow the basis of the “Government of the United States” as established respectively by contract under The Constitution of the United States of America and as defined by Federal Code  at Title 28, 3002, (15) (A) (B) (C)and supported by Title 18, (115) at Section 2384, and as defined by the Alaska Omnibus Act and elsewhere as the District of Columbia, et alia.  
 Protection of the rights, which are property interests, of all manner of citizen existing as Inhabitants of the State of Alaska must be the first valid concern of the State of Alaska, Inc., and its Officers.  Preservation of life and liberty in the face of this gross infringement of Natural Rights, Civil Rights (14th Amendment), and Human Rights (Universal Declaration) must be provided, and so it is that the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, have straight away sought the protection of Writ of Habeas Corpus, without which no other right can be guaranteed or, in the case of incarceration, asserted. 
Ground 15:  The Constitution of the United States of America has been violated repeatedly, breached by the Respondents and their Kin, and left Derelict for lack of enforcement by the Officers of the State of Alaska, Inc., such that it is in Process of being Voided for Willful Failure to Perform, yet it remains at this time the declared Supreme Law of the Land for the General Government as has been asserted repeatedly by the US Supreme Court and others:
";All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are null and void. ";  Marbury vs Madison, 5 US (2 Cranch) 137, 174, 176, (1803)
 
";Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.";  Miranda vs Arizona, 384 US 436 p. 491.
 
";An unconstitutional act is not law; it confers no right; it imposes no duties; affords no protection; it creates no office; it is in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed.";
Norton vs Shelby County118 US 425 p.442
 
";The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and the name of law, in in reality no law, but is wholly void, and ineffective for any purpose; since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment, and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it. No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce it.";  16th American Jurisprudence 2d, Section 177, late 2nd, Section 256";
Petitioners assert that Acts of Congress that are blatantly in opposition to the provisions of the public contracts subscribed to by the United States of America, including  The Constitution of the United States of America and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of which or what kind of Authority they wish to claim, are by their nature born null and void, ab initio, and that there is vast case law supporting our position.   All lawful Authorities are equally dependent on the Right to Contract, such that any action that derogates that fundamental right also leads to the destruction of whatever government is proposed. 
This is as true at Canon Law and under assertion of Divine Right of Kings as it is under Admiralty and the Protestant Declaration of Independence. 
 
A Documented History of the Issues Being Presented and Re-Statement in Support of Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus
 
(Historical commentary is in this typeface, Times New Roman.  Statements in annotated support of the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus appear in this typeface, Calibri, and in parentheses.)
 
               The United States went ";Bankrupt"; in 1933 and was declared so by President Roosevelt in Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111, and finally, as consolidated in Executive Order 6260, (See: Senate Report 93-549, pages 187 &amp; 594) under the ";Trading With The Enemy Act"; (Sixty-Fifth Congress,  Sess. I, Chs. 105, 106, October 6, 1917), and as codified at 12 U.S.C.A. 95a.
               The several States of the Union then pledged the faith and credit thereof to the aid of the National Government, and formed numerous committees, such as the ";Council of State Governments";, the ";Social Security Administration";, etc., to purportedly deal with the supposed economic ";Emergency"; caused by the bankruptcy. These organizations operated under the ";Declaration of Interdependence"; of January 22, 1937, and published some of their activities in ";The Book of the States.";
               The Reorganization of the bankruptcy is located in Title 5 of the United States Code Annotated. The ";Explanation"; at the beginning of 5 U.S.C.A. is most informative reading.  The ";Secretary of Treasury"; was appointed as the ";Receiver"; in Bankruptcy.  (See: Reorganization Plan No. 26, 5 U.S.C.A. 903,  Public Law 94-564, Legislative History, pg. 5967)  As a Bankrupt loses control over his business, this appointment to the ";Office of Receiver"; in bankruptcy had to have been made by the ";creditors"; who are ";foreign powers or principals";.
               The United States as Corporator, (22 U.S.C.A. 286E, et seq.) and ";State"; (C.R.S. 24-36- 104, C.R.S.  24-60-1301(h)) had declared ";Insolvency.";  (See: 26 I.R.C.  165(g)(1), U.C.C.  1-201(23), C.R.S. 39-22--103.5, Westfall vs.  Braley, 10 Ohio 188, 75 Am. Dec. 509, Adams vs. Richardson, 337 S.W.  2d 911; Ward vs. Smith, 7 Wall. 447)
 A permanent state of ";Emergency"; was instituted within the Union and the Federal Reserve has acted as the ";fiscal and depository agent"; of the “creditors” ever since. Please note that the  member banks of the Federal Reserve are all privately owned corporations, 22 U.S.C.A. 286d.
               The government, by becoming a “corporator” (See:  22 U.S.C.A. 286e)  lays down its sovereignty and takes on that character and status of a private citizen. It can exercise no power which is not derived from the corporate charter.  (See: The Bank of the United States vs. Planters Bank of Georgia, 6 L.  Ed. (9 Wheat) 244, U.S. vs. Burr, 309 U.S. 242). 
               (The Corporate Charter adopted by the “federal corporation”, aka, US Corp, included The Constitution of the United States of America as its By-Laws. It remains as a public contract.)
                The real party in interest is not the de jure ";United States of America"; or ";State";, but ";The Bank"; and ";The Fund.";  (22 U.S.C.A. 286, et seq., C.R.S.  11-60-103)  These  acts committed under fraud, force, and seizure are many times done under ";Letters of Marque and Reprisal"; i.e. ";recapture."; (See: 31 U.S.C.A. 5323)  in behalf of Foreign governments at war. This is an important point to remember as this discussion goes forward in time.
               On March 17, 1993, on page 1303 of Volume 33 of the Congressional Record, Congressman Traficant stated:  ";Mr. Speaker, We are now here in Chapter 11.  Members of Congress are official Trustees presiding over the greatest reorganization of any bankrupt entity in world history, the U.S. Government.";
               (The “U.S. government” is the government domiciled in the District of Columbia, which at various times represents three distinct entities: (1) the US Corporation formed as we have just seen and as documented at Title 28, 3002, (15) (A) (B) (C), (2) the “United States of America” defined as the 50 States United or “the Union of 50 States”, and (3) the “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia. In this comment Congressman Traficant was including all three primary meanings of “U.S. Government” as the term “General Government” or “U.S. Government” with a capital “G” is traditionally used in the Congressional Record when this meaning is applied----however, there is no indication that the States ever went “bankrupt” except as voluntary adjuncts. The actual subject of the bankruptcy was the Foreign Corporation known as the “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia.)
               This confession applies, not only to ";Members of Congress,"; but also to the Secretary of the Treasury as the ";Receiver in bankruptcy"; and to all state and federal ";officials"; who act under the de facto authority of  that bankrupt Foreign Corporation known as the United States acting as Trustees (that is, Foreign Agents) for foreign principals.  Trustees work for the creditors of a bankruptcy and are agents for foreign principals.
               In this case the creditors are the Federal Reserve Banks, the International Monetary Fund (the Fund) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank).
               It is worthy of note that an Attorney/Representative is required to file a ";Foreign Agents Registration Statement"; pursuant to 22 U.S.C.A 611c(1)(iv) &amp; 612), when representing the interests of a Foreign Principal or Power. (See: 22 U.S.C.A. 613, Rabinowitz vs. Kennedy, 376 U.S. 605, 11 L. Ed. 2d 940, 18 U.S.C.A. 219 &amp; 951).  (This same requirement was extended to non-attorney representatives as required by Trinsey v. Pagliaro.  As a result, every official and every attorney representing this version of “federal government”, including the Respondents, is a Foreign Agent and under obligation to declare him or herself as such and file the Foreign Agents Registration Statement.)
               The contrived ";emergency"; of the bankruptcy has created numerous abuses and usurpations, and abridgments of delegated Powers and Authority as clearly stated in Senate Report 93-549 (1973):
 
               ";A majority of the people of the United States have lived all of their lives under emergency rule.  For 40 years, [78 years now] freedoms and governmental procedures guaranteed by the Constitution have in varying degrees been abridged by laws brought into force by statutes of national emergency.";
 
               (The current Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus has arisen under precisely this circumstance. The Respondents are claiming that they have Authority to arbitrarily and indefinitely detain Americans without recourse to Due Process, based on unproven allegations of “belligerent acts” against the government.)
 
               According to 16 American jurisprudence, 2nd Edition, Sections 71 and 82, no ";emergency"; justifies a violation of any Constitutional provision.  Arguendo, ";Supremacy Clause"; and ";Separation of Powers";, yet it is clearly admitted in Senate Report No.  93-549, that abridgment has occurred.
               On March 6, 1933 the federal government got the Conference of Governors to pledge the faith and credit of the several States of the Union and their citizenry to the aid of the National Government, (see pp. 18 - 24 of The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin Roosevelt, Volume II, The Year Of Crisis, March 6,  1933) for what they openly admitted to doing. They encouraged the President to ask for and use extra-constitutional powers during the ";emergency"; that continues to this day. 
               (Please note that this was a completely voluntary action on the part of the Governors acting at that time and representing the 50 States United which were NOT the subjects of the bankruptcy.  The Governors arbitrarily claimed to have the granted Authority to commit the full faith and credit of the 50 States and also claimed the Authority to add the full faith and credit of the State’s “citizenry” as credit in behalf of the “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia. 
               The Governors had no such granted Authority. It was FRAUD for them to pledge the faith and credit of the State, which they did not own, as collateral for the debts of a Foreign Corporation. Likewise it was purely fraudulent for the Governors to claim “ownership” of the citizenry of the State, or claim any granted authority or possession of any inherent right to commit the “full faith and credit” of the citizenry of the several (50) States in payment of the debts of a Foreign Corporation.  
               The Citizens of the 50 States United are and were private and unincorporated living entities, who never acted or granted authority to anyone to act in their behalf in this manner whatsoever. They (and we) never gave permission to any entity to define them (us) as corporate entities, nor as “debtors” subject to the bankruptcy proceedings of any Foreign Corporation.   The Petitioners and their Progenitors never gave their consent to this action undertaken by the Governors and were for the most part never even made aware of it.)
 
               ";Emergency does not create power.  Emergency does not increase granted power or remove or diminish restrictions imposed upon power granted or reserved.  The Constitution was adopted IN a period of grave emergency.  Its grants of power to the Federal Government and its limitations of the power of the States were determined in the light of emergency and they are NOT altered by emergency."; [Emphasis added] Home Building &amp; Loan Assoc. v  Blaisdell 290 US 426 (1934).
 
               (The Respondents, Members of Congress, have no “special” or “extra” powers during an emergency, declared or undeclared, yet that is what they specifically and dishonestly claimed in 1933 and what they are continuing to claim as the excuse for their infringements against The Constitution of the United States of America today.)
 
     ";The Constitution of the United States is a LAW for rulers and people equally in war and peace,  and covers with the shield of its protection ALL classes of men, at ALL times, and under ALL circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was EVER invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of  the government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or to despotism."; [Statement of Opinion, U.S. Supreme Court, Annals 1866, in response to a new class of proposed infringing Reconstruction legislation that was promoted on the basis “national emergency”.]
 
               This State property (including the “full faith and credit” of the citizenry offered by the treasonous Governors) was the collateral accepted by the creditors (foreign principals) so the federal government could borrow more Federal Reserve Notes (private bank credit) and keep operating under reorganization.  Roosevelt issued Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111 and 6260:
               Executive Order 6073 issued on March 10, 1933, created the ";bank holiday"; and closed the doors of the bankrupt government chartered banks (they were bankrupt as a whole because they operated under government charter).
               Executive Order 6102  issued on April 5, 1933,  prohibited ";hoarding"; gold and required people to turn it (their property) in to the Federal Reserve Banks (the creditors).
               Executive Order 6111 issued on April 20, 1933, prohibited people from exporting gold.  (The creditors claimed that the gold no longer belonged to the State Citizens, as a result of having been pledged by their State Governors, one of the first dire results of the illegal action taken by the Governors in pledging the credit of the citizenry).
               Executive Order 6260 issued on August 20, 1933, combined 6102 and 6111.
               All of this is totally unlawful. The Governors of the 50 States pledged the PUBLIC property of the State, which they didn’t own, and the PRIVATE property of the State Citizens, property over which they had no reasonable authority and upon which they had no valid material claim, to be surrendered in payment of the debts racked up by the “United States of America” as defined by the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia, and so confiscated private property to pay a public debt never owed by the Citizens of any of the 50 States, all under color of law and a contrived economic “emergency”.
               These proclamations gave force to 470 provisions of Federal law.  These hundreds of statutes delegate to the President extraordinary powers, ordinarily exercised by the Congress, which affect the lives of American citizens in a host of all-encompassing manners.  These unconstitutional powers, taken together, confer enough authority to rule the country without reference to normal constitutional process.
               Under the powers delegated by these statutes, the President may: seize property; organize and control the means of production; seize commodities; assign military forces abroad; institute martial law; seize and control all transportation and communication; regulate the operation of private enterprise; restrict travel; and in a plethora of particular ways, control the lives of all American citizens.  The several States were seduced into the new policy in 1939, with Roosevelt's promise of federal grants-in-aid. 
               Federal Revenue Sharing (31 U.S.C. ( 6700 etseq.) is the modern version of the grants-in-aid program.  In return for these grants, the Governors of the several States would agree to uphold and maintain the (completely unauthorized and illegal and fraudulent) pledge of life, labor and property of their respective citizenry as surety for the debt obligations of the Federal government.  The politicians of these respective states gladly complied, because they viewed this as an opportunity to increase their own political power, letting the next generation of office holders worry over the long term consequences of their acts.
               (The “consequences” have come home to this generation of State officials. The Foxes have been in charge of the hen houses, in self-evident fact. Fortunately for the Petitioners (and as it turns out, the Foxes, too, there remains the thorny issue of the underlying Public Contracts to be enforced.  Back then, the innocent Americans slept on.  The Petitioners maintain that the State Governors never possessed any such Authority to indebt them nor any valid claim over their private property, nor any vested Authority to commit the resources of any of the 50 States to pay the debts of any Foreign Corporation.  Petitioners maintain that these Acts were undertaken under conditions of Fraud and maintained under conditions of fraud, deceit, and  improper legal presumption as is made apparent and manifest by the fact that State Citizens were not made aware of these actions at the time, the consequences were never fully disclosed, and none of it was ever voted upon or approved by the State Citizens so impacted. 
               These Acts of the Governors and the Members of Congress and the President of the United States at that time were blatant fraud committed against our Progenitors, and just as it was fraud then, is fraud now, and it cannot be applied by any means of rational argument to the Petitioners. We rightfully and emphatically renounce, deny, reject, and object to any such fraudulent agreements made in our behalf or the behalf of our Progenitors without their knowledge or consent, and certainly without our permission, and we assert our Natural Right (and in the case of “US citizens, Civil Right, and in the case of Non-Foreign entities, Human Right) to be free of the consequences of such constructive fraud, including the 470 separate provisions of Federal Law enacted at that time as well as those infringing Acts of Congress created since then including those known as the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012.
               The Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus now appearing should be seen in the larger context of re-securing and preserving the property interests of the Petitioners and the 50 States as required by the still-potent public contract known as The Constitution of the United States of America. The fraudulent acts of Governors long-dead cannot be held as debt or credit to this current generation, and no presumption of “debt” can be offered based upon fraud. The debts of the “United States of America” comprised of the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia, are precisely that---their debts. Let them conclude their bankruptcy amid Public recognition that the acts of the State Governors at that time were fraudulent, and that neither the 50 States nor their citizens owed the debts then subject to bankruptcy, and that the private property and “credit” of State Citizens was never within the granted Authority of any State Governor to pledge.
               If this “clearing of the slate” mandates bankruptcy of any entity, that entity can only be the “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia.  The 50 States were never subjected to or made party to bankruptcy proceedings except by the fraudulent acts of their Governors.  The Governors were pledging what they didn’t have to offer---the resources of a State they didn’t own, and of a citizenry they likewise didn’t own.
                As an analogy, the Petitioners will willingly Quit Claim all their property interests in the Island of Majorca, but as they have no property interests in the Island of Majorca, the Quit Claim while valid has no effect.  In the same way, the Governors of a State may “pledge” their credit and their property interests in a State or in the credit of the State’s citizenry, but if they personally have no such valid property interest, the pledge is valid but vacant of any legitimate claim or affect. The Governors acting in this manner clearly knew that they were committing fraud and treason against the State and against the Citizens, and in favor of the Creditors enforcing the bankruptcy of the “United States of America” as defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia.)
               On May 23, 1933, Congressman, Louis T. McFadden, brought formal charges against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank system, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Secretary of the United States Treasury for numerous criminalacts, including but not limited to, CONSPIRACY, FRAUD, UNLAWFUL CONVERSION, AND TREASON.  The petition for Articles of Impeachment was thereafter referred to the Judiciary Committee, and has yet to be acted upon.  (See: the Congressional Record, May 23, 1933, pp.  4055-4058.)
               (This is clear evidence that the members of the Judiciary Committee  have colluded to avoid correction and contractual compliance for almost 80 years.  The Petitioners, unimpeded by any necessity of Articles of Impeachment, denounce the Fraud practiced against them and their Progenitors, and demand that their contractually guaranteed Natural Rights, or in the case of “US citizens” Civil Rights, or in the case of Non-Foreign citizens, Human Rights (under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) must be held inviolate and protected by the State of Alaska, Inc., asserting that although they have been Victims of Fraud in the grossest terms imaginable, they are not in any case made Bankrupts, Debtors, or Corporate Entities by acts of constructive fraud practiced against them by treasonous government officials, foreign or domestic.)
               The President and the Respondents, Members of Congress, have all sworn an Oath to uphold, defend and preserve “The Constitution of the United States”, meaning that “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia.  The “Constitution of the United States” is a separate unique document not the public contract known as “The Constitution of the United States of America” though as part of the overall constructive fraud practiced against us, it is meant to be confused and interpreted as being the public contract.  Their Public Oath is submitted under Divinity, to establish their claim of Authority and Standing under Divine Law as Rulers, an Authority specifically forbidden in any Protestant Realm, where the individual Citizens are equal Sovereigns, Lords of Creation, granted equal Dominion over the Earth, and admitting no separation or intervening Power standing between them and the Divine. 
               America, as opposed to “the United States” was founded as a Protestant Realm, in which “all Men are created Equal”.  As Americans we can and must assert our Dominion, or we will become subject to the claims of Catholic Authority---the same exact Authority and allegiance to which these Foreign Agents---the Presidents of the United States (the District of Columbia et alia) and the Respondents, Members of Congress---swear their Public Oath of Office. 
               (The Petitioners assert that the continued usurpation of Authority by these Foreign Agents is based on fundamental and intolerable fraud and that their continued operation on American shores is in violation of Public Law.  Their continued infringement and lack of respect for the public contract under which they have been allowed to continue “in office” is likewise intolerable. The Petitioners assert their Protestant, Sovereign, and Divine Authority as living entities whose flesh lives and whose blood flows,  Equals to All Men, Sovereign Lords of Creation, granted Equal Dominion (Genesis 1: 26-28), and admitting no separation between themselves and the Divine, such that no other greater Authority or “Divine Right” may now or ever be claimed against them by the Creditors of the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia” or their Foreign Agents, the President of the United States of America, the Respondents, Members of Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury, et alia.)
 
               The Governors of the 50 States, however, swear to uphold the several Republican States of the Union, and by their acts and vacant pledges of property and credit not their own, breached their Duty to protect the People/Citizens and their Posterity from fraud, imposition, avarice and stealthy encroachment.  (See: Atkins et al. vs. U.S., 556 F.2d 1028, pg. 1072, 1074, The Tempting Of America, supra, pgs. 155 - 159, also see, 5 U.S.C.A. 5305 &amp; 5335, Senate ReportNo. 93-549, pgs.  69 - 71, C.R.S. 24-75-101).
               It is the Governors, therefore, who primarily acted in insurrection against the American government and who treasonously violated their Oath of Office by entering as Parties to the 1933 bankruptcy and pledging property they did not own in repayment of a debt they did not owe.  The Respondents, Members of Congress, have in this regard merely performed their duty owed a Foreign Corporation known as the “United States of America” as defined as the “District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia”, howbeit, that same fidelity has resulted in the existence of a de facto and illegal “dual allegiance” being presumed to exist by generations of Americans.
               However: ";... the United States is to be regarded as a body politic and corporate.  ... It is suggested that the United States is to be regarded as a domestic corporation, so far as the State of New York is concerned.  We think this contention has no support in reason or authority. ...  The United States is a foreign corporation in relation to a State.";  Merriam's Estate, 36 NE 505, 506 22.   See also: See United States v. Germane, 99 U.S. 508 (1879), Norton v. Shelby County, 118 U.S. 425, 441, 6 S.Ct. 1121 (1866), etc., dating to Pope v. Commissioner, 138 F.2d 1006, 1009 (6th Cir. 1943); where the state is concerned, the most recent corresponding decision was State v. Pinckney, 276 N.W.2d 433,436 (Iowa 1979).
            There is no provision for “dual citizenship” or any “dual allegiance”---See: Title 8 USC §§ 1101(a)(3), (21) and (22) and Public Law, 15 U.S. Stat., Chapter 249, pps 223-224.  
            (The Petitioners assert that far from being “representatives” of them or their interests, the Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation, are in fact operating under Oath as Foreign Agents. Any assertion that the Respondents, Members of Congress, are valid elected officials representing one of the 50 States United and at the same time, are officers of a foreign government, the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia”, is immediately disproven by both the Public Law cited above and the requirements of Federal Code, thus we have it from “both sides” of the fence:  the Respondents, Members of Congress, cannot be in “dual allegiance”.  They must either serve the 50 States United, a Protestant government built upon the Sovereignty of All Men, or they serve the Catholic government of the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, et alia.” 
                As the Respondents, Members of Congress, have sworn their Highest and ONLY Public Oath to the government of the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico…et alia”  and NOT the government of the 50 States United, and as they have manifestly acted in favor of the interests and claims of this other government and sought its material benefit to the disparagement of similar rights, claims, and interests of the 50 States United, and as they  have infringed even against the provisions of the public contract owed the 50 States United, it is clear that the Respondents, Members of Congress, have only ONE allegiance in evidence, and that allegiance is to a government that is Foreign to the 50 States United.
                The Petitioners claim that as Natural-born Foreign State Citizens they have been the victims of a constructive and material fraud promulgated against their Progenitors eight decades ago by the Governors of the several States who treasonously claimed Authorities not vested in their Offices and thereby fraudulently pledged the “credit” and therefore, also, the substance, of their States and the citizenry of their States in payment of debts accrued by a Foreign government calling itself the “United States of America” as defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico,…et alia”.  The  Petitioners further claim that  their natural government, that of America, the 50 States United, a Protestant Realm, was undermined, defrauded, and usurped by a Catholic government entity calling itself the “United States of America” as defined as  “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia” at the same time. 
                The Petitioners assert that the Respondents, Members of Congress, cannot by law hold two allegiances to two separate governments at the same time, and that the Respondents, Members of Congress, have sworn by Public Oath and have made manifest by their actions of disrespect and infringement against the 50 States United and the Petitioners, the legitimate Inhabitants thereof, a singular allegiance to the Foreign government of the “United States of America” as defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia” and have Dishonored their existing contract with the 50 States United, The Constitution of the United States of America, by acts of legislative infringement.
                The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, acting in their separate capacities as Natural-born State Citizens, or as “US citizens” owed equal Civil Rights, or as Non-Foreign entities owed Human Rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, denounce the Fraud practiced against them and their Progenitors, demand performance under contract, and require both their freedom and protection from any and all presumed Authorities advanced by the Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation,  in the form of infringing and self-serving legislation, recognizing that these same Respondents, Members of Congress, are acting as undeclared Foreign Agents of a Foreign government on American soil.   Petitioners maintain that the issuance of a protective Writ of Habeas Corpus is required to protect the property interests of the Petitioners and the State of Alaska.)
 
               Such principles as ";Fraud and Justice never dwell together"; (Wingate's Maxims 680), and ";A right of action cannot arise out of fraud."; (Broom's maxims 297, 729; Cowper's Reports  343; 5 Scott's New Reports 558; 10  Mass.  276; 38 Fed. 800) are foundational truths in all human society, and would be so with or without our approbation. These basic principles are too high in thought and concept to be denied, as is ";Due Process";, ";Just Compensation"; and “Justice” itself.  In all respects in the society of Men and Women throughout history and around the world, Honor is earned by honesty and integrity, and cannot be claimed under false and fraudulent pretenses. The color of the cloth one wears will not serve as a shield or buttress for those who seek to cover-up or ignore the usurpations, lies, trickery and omissions, deceits, and purposeful deceptions which have been manifestly employed by this Foreign government calling itself the “United States of America” while being comprised of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, et alia.
               (Petitioners assert that “the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico….et alia” is equivalent to the “United States of America” in the same way that the color orange is in fact an apple. We recognize this purposeful deceit for what it is, along with a great plentitude of others no less purposeful, self-interested, and deceitful, all arising from the initial frauds practiced against us and our Progenitors in 1933.)
               In 1938, the whole of America was bankrupted by design and by fraud.  The creditors, (foreign powers) seized ownership of the flag, State governments, their laws and constitutions, including every last comma and period, the whole country and its citizens.  These acts of fraud and treason placed Americans in peonage.  The 1937 Edition of the Book of the States openly declared that the people engaged in such activities as the Farming/Agro Related Industry had already been reduced to mere feudal ";Tenants"; on their Land, see the Book of The States, Book II, Volume II, 1937, p 155. 
               This is the greatest and most singular fraud ever perpetrated in human history. Such icons of perfidy as Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau presided over it and guided its implementation against the trusting American People.  For the next eight decades, they and their successors, worked the Great Fraud for their private benefit with the result that successive generations of Americans have been robbed of their material wealth, seen the value of their money decline by 96%, and been held in bondage to ever-increasingly oppressive and more apparently illegal acts of legislation undertaken to generate more income for or to protect the interests of the foreign usurpers.
               Either in ignorance or for self-interested reasons, ";government officials";, both State and federal, have gone along with this outrage and have endeavored to keep it all secret from the American people at the same time that they are suffering the outrages accumulated as a direct result of it.
               In 1940, Congress passed the ";Buck Act";, (4 U.S.C.S. Sections 105 113). In Section 110(e), the Act authorized any department of the federal government to create a ";Federal area"; for imposition of the ";Public Salary Tax Act"; of 1939, the direct progenitor of the Federal Income Tax.  This tax is imposed at 4 U.S.C.S. Sec. 111.  The Social Security Board had already created a ";Federal area"; overlay.
               Thus the obvious question arises: What is a ";Federal area";? A ";Federal area"; is any area designated by any agency, department, or establishment of the federal government. This includes the Social Security areas designated by the Social Security Administration, any public housing area that has federal funding, a road that has federal funding, and almost everything that the federal government touches through any type of aid. (See Springfield v. Kenny, 104 N.E. 2d 65 (1951 App.)) This ";Federal area"; purportedly attaches to anyone who has a Social Security Number.
               (Petitioners were lied to by Foreign Agents of the “federal government” and told that they “had to” sign up for a Social Security Number as a “condition of employment” not related in any way to the federal government.  They were coerced, also, to sign “Birth Certificates” for their children----another act of extortion and fraud practiced against them by the criminal “United States of America” domiciled in the District of Columbia.  Petitioners hold these and all other such claims of “ownership” or Authority based on material interest in the Petitioners, their children, or their property to be the result of fraud, misrepresentation, undisclosed adhesion contracts, and similar illegal acts undertaken by the Foreign government represented by the Respondents and Governors of the 50 States acting without Authority.)
               Through this mechanism, the so-called federal government, a recognized Foreign government, usurped the Sovereignty of the People, as well as the Sovereignty of the several States, by creating ";Federal areas"; within the boundaries of the states under the purported authority of Article 4, Section3, Clause 2 (4:3:2) in the Constitution of the United States of America.
               By this fraudulent base argument, all U.S. citizens [i.e. citizens of the District of Columbia] residing in one of the states of the Union, are classified as ";property";, franchisees of the federal government, and as an ";individual entity";.  (See Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Fox, 298 U.S. 193, 80 L.Ed. 1143, 56 S.Ct.  773.
               Under the ";Buck Act";, (4 U.S.C.S. Sections 105-113), the federal government has created ";Federal areas"; within the boundaries of all the several States. These areas are similar to any territory that the federal government acquires through purchase, conquest or treaty, thereby imposing federal territorial law upon all people in these ";federal areas";. Federal “territorial law” is evidenced by the Executive Branch's yellow fringed U.S. flag displayed in schools and most courtrooms.
               In 1966, Congress being severely compromised, passed the ";Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, by which the entire taxing and monetary system i.e.  ";Essential Engine"; (See: Federalist Papers No. 31) was placed under the Uniform Commercial Code. (See:     Public Law 89-719, Legislative History, pg. 3722, also see C.R.S. 5-1- 106).
               The Uniform Commercial Code was, of course, promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners On Uniform State Laws in  collusion with the American Law Institute for the ";banking and business interests."; (See: Handbook of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, (1966) Ed. pgs. 152 &amp; 153).
               Things steadily grew worse and on March 28, 1970, President Richard Nixon issued Proclamation No. 3972, declaring (again) an ";emergency"; because the Postal Employees struck against the de facto government for higher pay, due to inflation of the paper ";Bills of Credit."; –or as the bank defines them, “debt instruments” known as “Federal Reserve Notes”. (See: Senate Report No. 93-549, pg.  596)  Nixon placed the U.S. Postal Department under the control of the ";Department of Defense."; (See: Department Of The Army Field Manual, FM 41-10 (1969)).
               (The Petitioners maintain that Nixon was motivated to “renew” the “emergency” proclamations of much earlier Administrations, for fear that the “emergency powers” invoked in 1933 would be successfully challenged in court. That in turn would create opportunity to discover the Great Fraud under which the federal government has been allowed to operate and could also separately serve to overturn many egregious pieces of contract – infringing legislation. Petitioners assert that claim of and continuance of “emergency powers” has been the object of the “War on Terror” which provides a perpetual excuse for the federal government to claim that a state of emergency exists and so allows the government to operate under the same invalid “emergency powers” it claimed in 1933, even in the absence of any provable threat.)
               The constantly contrived ";emergencies"; which have been used as the excuse for tyranny, robbery, gross fraud, and political usurpation of our rightful government,  have created numerous abuses and usurpations, and abridgements of delegated Powers and Authority as stated in Senate Report 93-549 (not the least of which are represented by The Patriot Act, NDAA 2012, and Enemy Expatriation Act.)
               The statements heard in the Federal and State Tribunals, on numerous occasions, to the effect that Constitutional arguments are ";immaterial";, ";frivolous"; etc., are based upon concealment of the fraud being practiced against Americans and the equally well-concealed existence of the contractual duties owed to them. 
               Thus it is that only the most diligent scholars have realized that in the 18th century the word “federal” was a synonym for “contract” and that the “federal government” is a “contract government” and not as is often assumed, a “federation” of states.  This can be easily confirmed by the necessity of imposing direct per capita taxation in a federation of states, and the fact that no such per capita direct tax has ever been imposed.  The fact that the Constitution is a Contract and that the “debt” implied by the word “Constitution” is the debt incurred by the States to pay for SERVICES secured under contract is further obscured by describing those services as enumerated “Powers”. 
               In the 18th century, “powers” implied the basis of taking action, as in “empowerment”.  The Constitution agreement empowered, as in allowed, the federal government under contract to provide services in behalf of all the States.
               (Petitioners claim by way of analogy that 13 members of a condo association (associated under the Articles of Confederation) got together over beer and pretzels in Philadelphia and decided to create a new company (the federal government) to provide snow removal, lawn care, security, and several other named services (enumerated Powers)  in behalf of the condo owners. They called their written contract setting up the new service company “the Constitution” and agreed to pay dues (taxes) to the new company in exchange for these services.  At the same time, some members got nervous and wanted to make it clear what “services” and actions were NOT to be undertaken by the new company (government) and so they added stipulations clearly stating that the new company would NOT be allowed to block anyone’s driveway, or show partiality about emptying dumpsters, or clean the swimming pool (the Bill of Rights) and for a time, things went on very well. 
               More members joined the condo association and paid their dues and everyone prospered, but then, new management took over the company providing services under contract, and these people were determined to extort more money and exercise far more power than their predecessors.  They became predatory toward the original condo association and used their profits to set up their own condo association, which they named after the original one.  This allowed them to charge off the costs associated with their new private condo association and its service company (government) against the original condo association.  After all, they had the same name.  Who is to know?  Time went on, and the management of the service company got greedier and greedier.  They bought off or intimidated everyone to the point where they claimed to own or control nearly everything, and they blatantly ignored the requirements of their original contract. 
               Some of the condo owners finally stood up and said----“Wait a minute! ---- and then everyone living in the condos requested a Writ of Habeas Corpus to defend against a Bill of Detainer set forth against them by the service company. At this point, the service company is fraudulently claiming to own the original condos, the condo association, and everyone and everything living in and associated with the original condos. Via legislation, they are willing to kill, imprison, indefinitely detain, defame, and dishonor anyone who stands in their way.  If allowed, they will also claim that the presence of opposition to their aims and claims justifies their actions and that all their opponents are “terrorists”. )
               The furtherance and compounding of the frauds and endlessly contrived ";Emergency"; situations created to justify the continuance of “emergency powers” has been sustained by the ";Expatriated"; Foreign Agents of the United Nations and other Nations (Presidents, Members of Congress, Secretary of the Treasury, et alia)  and its Organizations, Corporations and Associations.  (See: Letter, Insight Magazine, February 18, 1991, pg.  7, Lowell L. Flanders, President, U.N. Staff Union, New York) 8 U.S.C.A.  1481 is one of the controlling statutes on expatriation as is 22 U.S.C.A.  611 - 613 and 50 U.S.C.A. 781.
               This entire scenario is in textbook compliance with ";Silent Weapons For Quiet Wars";, Research Technical Manual TM-SW7905.1, which discloses a Declaration of War upon the American people.  (See: pg. 3 &amp; 7).
                The Internal Revenue Service entered into a ";service agreement"; with the U.S. Treasury Department (See: Public Law 94-564, Legislative History, pg. 5987, Reorganization Plan No. 26) and the Agency for International Development, pursuant to Treasury  Delegation Order No.  91. 
               The Agency For International Development is an International paramilitary operation (See: Department of the Army Field Manual, (1969) FM 41-10, pgs. 1-4, Sec. 1-7(b) &amp; 1-6, Section 1- -10(7)(c)(1), 22 U.S.C.A. 284), and it includes such activities as ";Assumption of full or partial executive, legislative, and judicial authority over a  country or area."; (See: FM 41-10, pg.  1-7, Section 110(7)(c)(4)) also see, Agreement Between The United Nations And The United States Of America Regarding The Headquarters Of The United Nations, Section7(d) &amp; (8), 22 U.S.C.A.  287 (1979 Ed.) at pg. 241). It is to be further observed that the ";Agreement"; regarding the Headquarters District of the United Nations was NOT agreed to (See: Congressional Record - Senate, December 13, 1967, Mr. Thurmond), and is illegally situated in this country and officially unwelcome on American soil.
               The 1985 Edition of the Department Of Army Field Manual, FM 4110 further describes its International ";Civil Affairs"; operations.  At page 3-6 it is admitted that the Agency for International Development is autonomous and under direction of the International Development Cooperation Agency, and at page 3-8, that the operation is ";paramilitary.";  The International Organization(s) intents and purposes was to promote, implement and enforce a ";DICTATORSHIP OVER FINANCE IN THE UNITED STATES."; (See: Senate Report No. 93-549, pg. 186)
               There can be no doubt that they have thus far succeeded in their aims, and that those aims are completely predatory toward the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, and Americans in general. 
               It appears from the documentary evidence that the Internal Revenue Service Agents etc., are ";Agents of a Foreign Principal"; within the meaning and intent of the ";Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938."; They are directed and controlled by the corporate ";Governor"; of The Fund"; a/k/a ";Secretary of Treasury"; (See: Public Law 94-564, supra, pg. 5942, U.S. Government Manual 1990/91, pgs. 480 &amp; 481, 26 U.S.C.A.  7701(a)(11), Treasury Delegation Order No. 150-10), and the corporate ";Governor"; of ";The Bank"; 22 U.S.C.A. 286 &amp; 286a, acting as ";information service employees 22 U.S.C.A. 611(c)(ii).
               They have been and do now ";solicit, collect, disburse or dispense contribution (Tax - pecuniary contribution, Black's Law Dict. 5th ed.), loans, money or other things of value for or in interest of such foreign principal 22 U.S.C.A.  611(c)(iii), and they entered into agreements with a Foreign Principal pursuant to Treasury Delegation Order No. 91 i.e. the ";Agency For International Development."; (See: 22 U.S.C.A. 611(c)(2))
               Among other reasons for lack of authority to act, such as lack of a Foreign Agents Registration Statement, 22 U.S.C.A. 612 and 18 U.S.C.A. 219 &amp; 951, military authority cannot be imposed into civil affairs.  (See: Department Of The Army Pamphlet 27100- 70, Military Law Review, Vol. 70),
               This unelected, unrepresentative, unaccountable oligarchy of expatriates and aliens, fraudulently claims that they “represent” us and that their intent and purpose is to establish ";rational and equitable international economic relations";, yet as documented and also voiced by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and his successor Ben Bernanke, they have declared that they no longer ";stabilize the value of the dollar"; nor ";assure the value of the coin and currency of the United States";. Their own statements stand against the misrepresentations, deceits, and frauds that have allowed their existence in this country at all. (See: Public Law 95-147, 91 Stat. 1227, at pg. 1229)
               This was augmented by Public Law 101-167, 103 Stat.  1195, which discloses massive appropriations of re-hypothecated debt credit for the general welfare and common defense of  other Foreign Powers, including  ";Communist"; countries or satellites, International control of  natural and human resources in America, etc.  etc..
               A ";Resource"; is a claim of ";property"; and when related to people constitutes
";slavery."; 
               (This is clearly being asserted against the Petitioners; even though private (and by legal derivation, public) ownership of slaves was abolished by Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America, in 1868, far antecedent to the Great Fraud perpetuated in 1933.)
               The covert procedure used to implement and enforce these Foreign Constitutions, Laws, Procedures, Rules, Regulations, etc., has not yet been fully collected and assimilated nor presented as evidence to establish seditious collusion and conspiracy, but it is in clear evidence all around us.  We live with it every day. Our patience and tolerance for those who pervert the very necessary and basic foundations of society have been pushed to insufferable levels.  They have ";fundamentally"; changed the form and substance  of the de jure Republican form of Government guaranteed to each State under Article 4, Sec. 4 of the U.S. Constitution, exhibited  a willful and wanton disregard for the Rights, Safety and Property of others, evinced a despotic design to reduce the people to slavery, peonage and involuntary servitude, under a fraudulent, tyrannical, seditious foreign oligarchy, with intent and purpose to institute, erect and form a ";Dictatorship"; over all Citizens and their Posterity.
               They have insinuated their Foreign Agents, Confederations, and Alliances, and under pretense of ";emergencies";, which for the past 80 years, they themselves created, promoted and furthered, and have formed a multitude of offices for themselves at public expense, and retained others of alien allegiance to perpetuate their frauds and to eat out the  substance of the Americans.
               They have trespassed on our Lives, Laws, Liberties, Properties and Families and have intolerably endangered our Peace, Safety, Welfare and Dignity.  As Ambrose Bierce observed, “To steal were folly, for ‘tis plain, in cheating there is greater gain.” The perpetrators of this scheme have certainly profited more and longer by fraud and usurpation than would have ever been endured by outright theft. 
               (Having researched this fraud down to its modern roots and into its very depths, the Petitioners find that they are not angry; rather, they are ashamed that they were ever such fools and righteously indignant that the public officials they trusted to preserve the government have been corrupted, manipulated, and dispensed with in this cavalier manner and to such an outrageous extent. They have lived to see and have clearly heard a Russian peasant’s shoe slammed down on an American podium, but curiously, their response is not anger. It is humility and determination to have done with this Fraud, all its works, all its ways, and all its workers, once and for all, and to re-establish American government in America. ) 
                In the field of law we have suffered removal of federal common law with the Erie Railroad Co. v Tompkins case, 304 US 64; and the hodge-podging of the jurisdictions of Law and Equity together, which is known as ";One Form of Action";; as two of the main insanities dictated by the supposed new “owners” of Alaska and America.               
               Sometime between 1958 and 1970 the Law of Admiralty was mixed in with the ";One Form of Action civil actions";.  (See Rule 1 in the 1958 and 1970 Editions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in Title 28, United States Code.) leading to endless iterations of different forms and venues of law within the same courts and even within individual suits. Only a very astute attorney or a very dogged student of law persistently badgering the judge to declare jurisdiction with every change of wind can keep up with the madness.
               In Federalist Paper No. 83 Hamilton expressed, ";My convictions are equally strong that great advantages result from the separation of the equity and the law jurisdiction ...";  The Constitution establishes the three jurisdictions as separate in Article III.
               There is no Constitutional authority for operating in bankruptcy under Martial Law/Rule.  The legislative, executive, and judicial branches no longer exist, as the de jure government has fraudulently been dissolved and the entire country has been received in bankruptcy by the Fund (IMF) and World Bank through a series of equally fraudulent ";emergency war powers"; acts.
               HOWEVER, the public commercial CONTRACTS are still in existence, and still in effect under International Law of Commerce and Admiralty.  The usurpers couldn’t quite figure out a way of profiting from their new kingdom without trade and commerce, and they couldn’t quite dare to remove the pretense of having lawful granted Authority to Act, so they translated the de jure document, The Constitution for the united States of America” into the public contract known as The Constitution of the United States of America. That contract under International Law and enforcement of its provisions by the State Officials responsible for its enforcement, legal objection to the gross Fraud practiced upon us, and the requested prompt action of State Judicial Offices in executing the sacred duties embodied in the Writs, are now our only recourse. 
               The intent and objective of the original bankruptcy was not to resolve any ";emergency";; it was to create an emergency for the express purpose of changing the governmental, social, economic and industrial character of the de jure society, to infringe and abrogate and derogate inalienable Rights, steal and alienate the birth Rights of the People, impair the obligations of honest contracts, to defraud and to obtain a benefit from that fraud, to create turbulence and contention in the world to allow more war profiteering, to overthrow the legitimate American government, and to establish in its stead a corrupt totalitarian oligarchy in direct contravention to the Law of the Land, and against the Peace, Dignity and Security of the Inhabitants of America.
               Because the States also are now technically bankrupt entities not even the (de facto) State courts have any sovereignty; no strictly enforceable jurisdiction, and can only invite participants into court.   State courts are now only courts of mediation, just as District courts are merely courts of “special jurisdiction”.   Fines collected by State courts go to the Federal Reserve Banks, the depository agents for the Fund and the Bank.  Thus, administrative agents in this State are also acting as trustees and agents for foreign principals, and are required to register as such.
               Similarly, guilt or innocence is being bought and sold and speculated upon, as securities markets based on the Alaska Court System (and every other State Court System) are now freely traded on the stock market, together with a “derivatives” market that trades up or down depending on the number of misdemeanor and felony suits on the docket.  More felony cases equates to more “value” for the court.  More felony convictions means even more asset gain for the court and its investors.  It is little wonder that we now have more than six million Americans in prison, and more than 800 FEMA Camps established nationwide, waiting to receive more “criminals” and “terrorists”.
               The same criminals who have worked this fraud for three generations make money off all the slave labor they can coerce from the prison populations, and they can force the hapless “taxpayers” to pay the cost of supporting this “free labor resource”, too, making the “prison industry” doubly profitable for them.  
            (The Petitioners appeal to the Offices of the Alaska Supreme Court and to the Justices holding Office, as men and women who have devoted their lives to the sacred service of the Law, to exert those 11th hour safeguards in their keeping, the Writs, to protect those who deserve protection. 
            We can all see the writing on this wall.  For the legal profession continuing business as usual means betrayal of the Law and of Justice, and a world in which attorneys and judges are reduced to being servants of the most venal commercialization of crime.
            It is by far not only for themselves that the Petitioners now act and call upon the Justices of the Alaska Supreme Court to act in the same spirit.  
            As the enormity of the fraud practiced upon the Americans comes home to them and as the details are spread far and wide throughout the world community as has already been done and is, obviously, being done, the perpetrators will be justifiably afraid of the consequences of their actions and will try by various means to secure public support for their persecution of the victims.  They will also try to deny guilt, complicity, and even plain and self-evident truth.  Those Americans who oppose this fraud and usurpation by Foreign Agents will be trumped up as the Boogey Man, as “kooks” and violent “homegrown terrorists” bent on “destroying the legitimate government” when in fact, they are merely asserting their guaranteed rights under contract, making just claims against fraud, and seeking to restore an American government to America.)       
               If ";public officials";, Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation, represent the anyone under the Constitution, they can only collect, use, and be paid in Constitutional money, gold and silver or certificates representing the same. They can only operate at common law in all criminal matters except for Maritime contracts. That is the plain and simple requirement of our public contract, which has so long been left unenforced.
               Contrast those requirements with our current situation.  Federal Reserve Banks are private banks.  They are and they have always been about as “federal” as Federal Express. You will not find them listed among any governmental agencies.  The truth of it is as close as the Washington, DC, telephone book.  Check the government listings.  You will not find the Federal Reserve. It is a totally private association of private banks, but in the same genre of semantic swindles that gave us three different common meanings of “United States of America”, the gullible public was led to believe that the “Federal Reserve” was a public agency.
               The “Federal Reserve Notes” issued by the Federal Reserve banks are a private script, not “US Dollars” at all.  As you will see, if you closely read Title 26, Chapter A, Subchapter N, Section 1-1861,  “effectively connected income”, (iv) concerning banking, you will find yourself in Title 12 of the Federal Code.  You will learn that because you have a Social Security Number (which you were falsely told was a mandatory condition of employment) you are considered ---among other things----to be a member of the National Banking Association, and that for the “privilege” of using the banking services of the Federal Reserve banks and their private script, you are obligated to pay the Federal Income Tax.  More fraud, in other words, based on misrepresentation, undisclosed contractual obligations, and then, exercised by mammoth amounts of “legal presumption” and buried in literally tons—77,123 pages of regulations at last report--- of purposefully evasive and obtuse goobledygook legalese and bureausprache.
               If ";public officials";, Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation,  use Federal Reserve ";Notes,"; (technically, these pieces of paper don’t even meet the legal definition of a “Note” because they don’t purport to deliver anything to anyone on presentment) or funds reducible only to Federal Reserve ";Notes"; in public business, they are using non-redeemable,  dishonored, impaired, depreciated, re-hypothecated, interagency, international bills of debt/credit akin to a place-holder or casino chip, and by definition, are operating a de facto government, which is treason against The Constitution of the United States of America and the Offices they claim to hold as representatives of the 50 States United, and by subrogation, a gross violation of the duty owed to the Petitioners.
                ";A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong  gives it a superficial appearance of being right,"; said  Thomas Paine, and indeed, such obvious and readily available observations as these are before our eyes every hour of every day, and still, for almost eighty years, the Americans have slept on and listened to the propaganda, stoically bearing their unjust burdens, sending their sons and daughters off to wars that benefit profiteers, believing every lie told to them by “their” government, pathetically cherishing their flags and their national memorials, and all the while, they rise up and lie down as slaves “in the Land of the Free”. 
               It is a clearly established principle of law that a corporation being incorporeal and a creature of the law, indeed, a “legal fiction” must be represented by an attorney. An attorney representing an artificial entity, such as the “United States of America”, must appear with the corporate charter and law in his hand. A person acting as an attorney for a foreign principal must be registered pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act (22 USC Section 612 et seq.).     See Victor Rabinowitz et. al. v Robert F. Kennedy 376 US 605.
            (Trinsey v. Pagliaro further establishes that corporations cannot be represented  on the strength of attorneys acting as Injured Parties, and that statements of attorneys are not sufficient and do not amount to testimony in written or verbal argument.)
            Taken together, these two legal requirements alone, if properly exercised, would serve to expose the corruption by forcing the Foreign Agents into the light of day, and hauling their corporate masters out of the shadows, but you will note that the most avid proponent of “corporate responsibility” in America, the former US Attorney General, Robert Fitzgerald Kennedy, was gunned down by an assassin. 
            (This fact should be noted as relevant to the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, as it clearly indicates the violent nature of those who are reaping benefits from the destruction of America, and underscores the severity of the threat the Petitioners are under from those who offered the Bills of Detainer in the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012) and now, the Enemy Expatriation Act.)
               Failure to file the ";Foreign Agents Registrations Statement"; with the court goes directly to the heart of the Fraud being practiced and the usurpation of jurisdiction that has resulted.  Virtually all attorneys in America dealing with public sector cases lack standing to be before the court, and is a felony pursuant to 18 USC 219, &amp; 951, for them or their corporate masters, such as the Respondents, Members of Congress, to appear without their Foreign Agents Registration and Corporate Charter. The conflict of law, interest and allegiance is obvious.  While representing a Foreign government to which they have sworn their Public Oath, the Respondents pretend to be representing the 50 States United and by subrogation, the Petitioners.  Attorneys representing a foreign government are passing themselves off as “US Attorneys” and conveniently misrepresenting their status, allegiances, and actions. 
 
               ";NO MAN CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS."; See See the Gospel of Luke 16:13, Jeffery v Pounds, 67 Cal.App.3d 6,  Cinema 5 v Cinerama 528 F 2d 1384, Easly v Brookline Trust 256 SW 2d  983.
 
               In US v Woodly 726 F 2d 1328 and 751 F 2d 1008, it is ruled that a judge who can be influenced by another Department or others, is not an Article III de jure judge.  And in US v Ferreira 13, How, 42 it is ruled that a judge who can be influenced by another (not independent), is only a commissioner under a treaty.
               The enabling treaty must be produced and in evidence, announced and made available every time a Statutory Court is in session, along with the Foreign Agents Registrations of every judge, attorney, or corporate representative of the “United States of America” as defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico….et alia” without exception to be in compliance, yet every day, these courts operate under conditions of lawlessness anonymity, passing themselves off as “American” and the attorneys go on practicing before these courts without standing, such that “my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.”
               There is no authority under the Constitution of the United States of America for Statutory Administrative courts, and yet they have been proliferating along with the fashionable trend toward imprisoning everyone, and they have been allowed to continue functioning under color of law without the slightest oversight regarding their operations and declarations and documentation required of these courts and those who practice in them.  We have Tax Courts, Bankruptcy Courts, Traffic Courts, Family Courts, and if we are honest, Court Courts, howbeit, we call them Judicial Councils.  Most Americans take it for granted that these are “their” courts, when in fact, they exist to serve the interests of an undeclared foreign government.
               In 2002, 96% of all law suits filed on earth were filed in the United States.  In the State of Alaska alone, the Alaska Legislature averages passage of nearly 300 new or amended laws per year, or 3,000 per decade. There is no possibility that the Citizens can know or obey all these laws, nor is there rational hope of their enforcement.
               The entire country is running afoul because the contractual obligations of The Constitution of the United States of America are not being enforced.  In these and other matters related to the enforcement of this vital contract, the Officers of the State of Alaska bear a prime responsibility.  It is placed upon the Executive Branch of the State of Alaska to enforce, upon the Judicial Branch to interpret, and upon the Legislative Branch to enact such laws as are in compliance with the overarching contracts and in support of the Public Good. 
               A lack of respect for and enforcement of these provisions of our public contracts has enabled the continuing downward spiral of America at the hands of a foreign government that seized control under conditions of fraud and which has continued to operate the incorporated “State” governments as franchises for nearly eight decades. 
               ";We (Courts) have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given.  The one or the other would be treason to the Constitution.";  (Emphasis added) Cohen v Virginia 6 Wheat 264.  Yet, as we have seen, by treaty—a fact left undeclared and without oversight--- the Statutory courts have been allowed to usurp authority and jurisdiction, to punish and brand Americans in every respect, requiring “licenses” for the exercise of basic rights, such as the right to travel, sitting in judgment of personal relationships, and rapaciously exacting “tribute” in the form of unlawful taxation of those not rationally subject to the “Federal Income Tax”-----all these evils and more have been allowed under conditions of fraud, presumption, and most especially, lack of enforcement of contractual obligations.
               ";In all Cases ... in which a State shall be a Party ... the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction ..."; Article 3,  Section 2, U.S. Constitution.
               Judges who pretend judicial power without really having it, and when they act for  foreign principals, violate 18 USC  219 and 951.
               (The Petitioners did not give permission to any entity, living, dead, or corporate, to pledge their life, liberty, bodies, property, or labor for someone else's benefit. Specifically, neither they nor their Progenitors delegated Authority to any Governor of any State among the several States United to pledge our credit or encumber any aspect of our substance in payment  of the debts of the “federal government”, by which we mean that totally bankrupt, functionally dead-at-law, foreign municipal corporation domiciled in Washington, D.C. called the ";United States of America"; defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico….et alia.”  The Petitioners did not ever enter into any willing contract with this version of “United States of America” nor did they ever willingly, knowingly, and under conditions of full disclosure submit themselves to its jurisdiction or become “US citizens” by any valid contract.
               Any pledge that was made in their behalf or in behalf of their Progenitors was made under conditions of virulent fraud by the Governors of the 50 States United acting without granted Authority, without ownership interest, and in conflict with known Public Law and  contract. This fraud has been practiced against the Petitioners via the use of purposefully misleading semantic devices, such as calling “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico…et alia” the “United States of America” and equally purposeful misrepresentation of institutions, including the “Federal Reserve”, hiding the nature of statutory courts, and obscuring the allegiances and functions of “public” officials, such as the Respondents, Members of Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury, and so on.
               All such acts of fraud and usurpation committed against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, and their Progenitors, in contradiction to the clear contractual requirements of The Constitution of the United States of America, are acts of treason committed by undeclared Foreign Agents and public officials acting outside their granted Authority. Security for debt can never be lawfully obtained by fraud, and no conceivable debt or circumstance may be promoted as an “emergency” to excuse such venal, self-interested, purposeful deceit and intolerable presumption.
               Fraud vitiates everything that comes after. The Petitioners, along with every other American, have been vilely defrauded of their property, including their Natural, Civil, and as the case may be, Human Rights. ";Fraud vitiates the most solemn contracts. Documents, and even judgments"; U.S. v Throckmorton, 98 US 426.  It vitiates pledges made against credit, and by corollary, against the substance of property.  Fraud renders 78 years worth of contract -infringing provisions embedded in “emergency” legislation, all illegal Executive Orders, and all related oppressive Public Policy invalid, and it also invalidates the current offending legislation, the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012).
               The Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation, have sworn their Catholic Oath of Allegiance to a foreign government known as the “United States of America” as defined as “the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, et alia.” As Public Law and Federal Code have demonstrated, they cannot have two such allegiances, and indeed, upon reflection, it is apparent that these Foreign Agents have only one allegiance and it is to that “other” United States.  By their own acts they have repeatedly promoted the continuance of gross constructive fraud against Americans, depriving the Petitioners of their property, their security, and any semblance of performance due under contract, consistently infringing upon the contractually guaranteed rights of the Petitioners, and uniformly failing to declare their status as Foreign Agents.
               The foreign government these Respondents represent routinely engages in activities forbidden to the de jure State and acts in collusion with International interests pursuant to 
26 IRC 6103(k)(5) under the pretense of the ";Intergovernmental Personnel Act";, acting as the ";FedState Team."; The FedState Team is underthe direction and control of the Assistant Commissioner (INTERNATIONAL).  See Internal Revenue Manual Section 1132.61 Pages 1100-40.1 through 1100-40.2 (1992 Edition) and FedState Bulletins -Commissioner's Advisory Group Meeting September 24 &amp; 25 Minutes. 
               The State government is supposed to protect citizens from excesses by federal government personnel, and likewise the federal government is supposed to protect the Petitioners from excesses by State government personnel.  That is, generally speaking, the only valid reason the Petitioners and their Progenitors ever created a government---protection of our lives and our property, including our rights and immunities. 
               Unfortunately, the aim of the government truly represented by the Respondents, Members of Congress, is excess and subjugation, so this ";FedState Team"; establishes cooperation between all government personnel working not for the people, but for foreign principals, seeking to break the natural allegiance of local government to local people.  We have seen the results in the use of National Guard troops in foreign lands, the destruction of the Alaska State Defense Force and its leadership being commandeered by National Guard commands, and most recently, the end of Posse Commitatis rules, allowing and promoting the use of our own troops, our own flesh and blood, equipped and trained with our tax money, against us and in defense of this criminal, usurping, foreign government.
               The undeclared operation of all Statutory Courts in America, the presence of no less than 63 armed agencies of the “federal government”, the continuing wild predation of the American monetary system, the building and provisioning of more than 800 FEMA internment camps, continued out of control spending, the war-mongering, the lock down of resources and industrial development, and non-stop action by the Respondents, Members of Congress, to pass legislation in blatant contradiction to The Constitution of the United States of America, including the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012), are all readily observable and clear indications that the perpetrators of this immense Fraud against the American People are not only very real, they are running scared, and trying hard to dream up some kind of cover story that will sweep the actual circumstance under the rug of history again.
               The Petitioners are the victims of gross fraud. They and the Progenitors have lost incalculable time, money, and peace as a result of the activities of these undeclared Foreign Agents.   The Petitioners are owed by contract at the very least enforcement of the provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America, their physical safety, the enjoyment of their property, and freedom from assault against any of their rights, immunities, and prerogatives by persons presumed to “represent” them and their interests.
               Should public officials in the State of Alaska continue to aid and abet these acts of fraud and propose to continue this system of de facto government unopposed, they will be acting as trustees for foreign principals, as defined in 22 USC 611, namely The Fund (IMF), and The Bank. As such they will be required to file a Foreign Agents Registration Statement form and supplements thereto, pursuant to 22 USC 612, and are not exempt pursuant to 22 USC 613, see Rabinowitz v Robert Kennedy 376 US 605.  They will also lose recourse to any granted Authority to Act in behalf of the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska and will be pursued and prosecuted at Law on an International basis.
               By continuing in ignorance or on purpose to administer this perfidy, ";public officials"; at all levels are committing treason against the Constitution of the United States of America. When confronted with these facts, they must take their stand, either to assist and protect the victims of this vast fraud, and to enforce the contractual provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America, or, to come out of the closet and openly declare that they are Foreign Agents acting without granted Authority.
               ";There is no position which depends on clearer principle than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid.  To deny this would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above the master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid."; -- Federalist Paper No. 78 Alexander Hamilton
               We have indeed come to the pass Alexander Hamilton so eloquently described. Those entrusted with our government have fallen by fraud, by self-interest, by ignorance, by cowardice, by lack of moral virtue, by every weakness and insidious corruption known to fallible Man and Woman, and it is left to the rest of us to do something to save our own bacon and that of our beloved country.
                (The Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation, have so far breached their contractual obligations as to claim authorities that are specifically forbidden to them  by approving indefinite detainment without recourse to Due Process in contradiction to the provisions of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America.  The circumstance should speak for itself, but taken in the context of the history leading up to this moment, it takes on a more urgent, larger, and more somber importance. 
                This is far from the first time that the provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America have been trashed by the Respondents, Members of Congress.  Americans have been living under a false “state of emergency” for over a hundred years and under a fraudulent bankruptcy for eight decades and have suffered innumerable infringements against their laws, lives, liberty, and property since then. 
                The government of the “United States of America” as defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico….et alia” has become a very powerful, very criminal foreign government that has used its position of contractual trust for its own enrichment at the gross detriment of those it pretends to serve and it has by fraud, deceit, and presumption robbed three generations of Americans.  It stands ready now to imprison millions of us, confiscate our property, defame us, and further victimize the victims of this now ancient fraud.  
                 The Petitioners realize the extreme difficulty that the Alaska Supreme Court, Inc., is presented by our Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.  Having itself been defrauded, the “State of Alaska” in all its forms as a corporate entity is but a shell of its true self, no more a part of the true “State of Alaska” than a mask is a part of it wearer.  For many years, the State of Alaska, Inc., has conceived of itself as a corporate franchise of the “United States of America” operating in its behalf and at its bequest, as the administrator set over this plot of land and its people. Nonetheless, by contract the “State of Alaska, Inc.” has been created and by contract it shall live and die.  The obligations it holds are all by contract no less than any other government, and with those contractual obligations go the power and the right of enforcement.
            As one party to this action has described it, “It’s like being asked to slug your Mother really hard in defense of your Grandma.”
            Petitioners must ask----who is more deserving of protection?  (1) The renegade, criminal, foreign government represented by the Respondents, that by fraud and usurpation has insinuated itself into nearly every facet of American life, and which now shows every sign of despotism and utter recklessness?  (2) The victims of this Fraud, both the State of Alaska and the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska? 
            By exerting the power inherent in Writ, the Offices of the State of Alaska Supreme Court have the exercise of one of the few remaining safeguards available to Alaskans, and so stand enabled to fulfill their public contract in full Honor.  The remaining Offices of the State of Alaska are similarly invoked and enabled by the Petitioners’ actions.  It is no longer a matter of having nothing to act upon. The contracts have been fully invoked, and for that, the only glory or blame rests upon the Petitioners.
            The Petitioners are not alone in being the victims of a gross Fraud that has been practiced against every American on a generational basis.  Every soul to whom this Petition is addressed is similarly endangered and subject to the loss of life, liberty, and other property interests of irreplaceable value, and is put at risk by these same issues in so urgent a fashion, that we hope we may prevail upon the Offices of the Alaska Supreme Court to act in favor of the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.)
 
 Additional and Amended Remedies Sought
            Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court confirm in Public Record that the Natural-born Foreign State Petitioners, that is, Petitioners born in one of the 50 States United and made States prior to 1861 and prior to 1933, respectively, are not “citizens” or “residents” with respect to the General Government by Nature nor are they necessarily connected to it. They are living entities and sovereign Lords of Creation, equal in every respect to all others granted dominion, regardless of any contrary presumed or alleged allegiance which they firmly rebut.  The Petitioners are Americans, not subject to the General Government in the assertion of their Natural Rights, nor owed less than EQUAL “Civil Rights” if they are “US citizens” or the “Human Rights” declared by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, owed to them if they are “human beings”, such that all Inhabitants of Alaska however defined are owed the Right to Contract and Right to Due Process without infringement or derogation of any kind by Acts of Congress. 
            As by Divine Law we were created, as by contract our relations are defined, and as by substance our equity is determined, Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, demand full redress and performance under contract, remedy under Equity, full cure and maintenance under Admiralty, and sovereign respect and due diligence under all Canon and Divine Law.  Petitioners call upon the Offices of the Alaska Supreme Court to bear Witness and invoke these Offices to in all respects uphold the rights of the Inhabitants, to enforce the various duties owed the Inhabitants by the General Government, including the Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation, and to require all remedies and cures and due diligence due and owed human beings, US citizens, Americans, and Lords of Creation. 
            Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court honor their Quo Warranto interrogatory, and demand evidence of any known Authority to Act possessed by the Respondents enabling these offending Acts of Congress (the Patriot Act and the NDAA 2012)  absent Honoring their Oath of Office under Divine and Canon Law (in the case of “US citizens” and others under federal jurisdiction, the only jurisdiction wherein Public Oath under submission to Divinity is known to exist) and absent Honoring their contract, The Constitution of the United States of America under Admiralty and Commercial Franchise Law in all cases affecting Natural-born Americans, and also absent Honoring the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which their own government approved.
            Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will uphold the contractual and moral obligations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its subject provisions in no uncertain terms, and issue the Writ of Habeas Corpus being sought by the Petitioners in token of that support, such that the Human Rights of the Petitioners known as “Human Beings” are protected as required under International Law. 
            Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court regard the presence of a third powerful pending Act of Congress dedicated to codifying infringements against the Petitioners property interests as indicative of concerted effort on the part of Congress to permanently enroll infringements that were offered as “emergency” measures  even when no emergency exists, and admit by action issuing a protective Writ of Habeas Corpus that the existence and content of the Enemy Expatriation Act serves to further justify said issuance.
            Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court, Inc., will add the charge of Seditious Conspiracy to the named charges against Respondents in behalf of those “US citizens” whose Civil Rights are destroyed and whose “Government of the United States” is undermined by these Acts of Congress, and submit their charge for prosecution under Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 115, Section 2384 to the lawful authorities responsible for enforcement.  
            Petitioners ask and seek that the charge of “Violation of Oath of Office” be removed from their list of charges offered against the Respondents; upon close examination of their Oath of Office, it does not appear that they have acted in contradiction to it.  Rather, they have upheld their allegiance to the Foreign government to the detriment of their contract with the 50 States United, and have honored their allegiance to the Foreign government in their attempts to derogate the Petitioners rights, and have served the interests of the Foreign government by tolerating and enshrining the fraud first perpetrated against the Americans in 1933 and continuing to this day. 
            Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court, Inc., will in public acknowledge the difficulties which abound in the understanding and interpretation of Law when the interpretation of such words as “United States” and “United States of America” are applied to dissimilar objects, left to be defined only by context, and generally serving to create confusion and disunity under interpretation.  Since Downes v. Bidwell the growth of public misunderstanding has been exponential in regard to the federal government and its authority and equally, lack of authority, in various contexts, a situation only compounded by the ongoing and unresolved bankruptcy and receivership entered into by the “United States of America” in 1933.  To the extent that the Alaska Supreme Court, Inc., can speak to and unravel these complexities in rendering a response, the Petitioners ask that it be done in the interests of the Public Good. 
            Petitioners also ask and seek that the Offices held by the Alaska Supreme Court, Inc., will acknowledge and address  the extraordinary difficulty with which the State of Alaska must contend when the Petitioners represent all Natures of Inhabitant, all seeking protection of Writ of Habeas Corpus, and being forced to apply and respond to no less than three definitions of “United States of America” and no less than three presumed bases of Authority to Act derived from Canon Law , International Admiralty Law  and International Equity Law, with some Petitioners asserting their Natural  and Unalienable Rights guaranteed sovereigns under Divine Law,  others under Admiralty recognized, and under equity distributed in their favor,  while still others are “merely” contractually guaranteed “service” under The Constitution of the United States of America, and still others are asserting their Civil Rights under the 14th Amendment and Federal Code, and  yet more Inhabitants are asserting their Human Rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Law. 
            The conditions of fraud under which the Foreign government represented by the Respondents has operated for nearly eight decades has led to wild proliferation of semantic obfuscation, such that the Alaska Supreme Court and certainly the Petitioners are left to chop their way through a virtual jungle of arbitrary and fanciful legal definitions to arrive at the heart of the Truth, and are forced to engage in a most unreasonably arduous exercise both at law and in historical research to derive their conclusions----a fact which the Petitioners ask the Alaska Supreme Court to recognize as additional proof that an obvious and intentional effort has been made by numerous parties over a long period of time to purposefully obscure the underlying fraud against the 50 States and their Inhabitants, and to hide the identities and allegiances of Foreign Agents, including the Respondents, the Secretary of the Treasury, and others posing as public officials “representing” the Petitioners and the State of Alaska, and to misrepresent the nature of various entities, including the Federal Reserve and the Statutory Court System, and even in the most obnoxious instance, have sought to obscure the fact that The Constitution of the United States of America represents a valid contract between this Foreign government domiciled in the District of Columbia and the 50 States United, incorporated or not, and that the “States” so engaged under contract are obligated to enforce the provisions of The Constitution of the United States in favor of the Petitioners.
            The Petitioners ask and seek that the Alaska Supreme Court will honor the contractual obligations presented for enforcement, insomuch and so far as they are enabled to act. 
Conclusions:
            The infringements being offered by the Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation, are coordinated and ongoing, as evidenced by the existence of the incipient Enemy Expatriation Act, the content of which serves to codify infringements against the Right to Contract that were made available as emergency administrative provisions under the Patriot Act. 
            The Enemy Expatriation Act proposes to codify this prior administrative undermining of the Right to Contract in the same way that the offending provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act (2012) codify the undermining of the Right to Due Process that was similarly begun under the Patriot Act. 
            The existence of two such interlocking and mutually supportive Acts of Congress, the NDAA (2012) and the Enemy Expatriation Act, provides prima facie evidence of a purposeful, integrated, coordinated, and conspiratorial effort on the part of Members of Congress to codify and enroll as Law those offending “emergency” administrative provisions of the Patriot Act long after any emergency has ceased to exist.
            The Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation, wear three “crowns” under Roman Law that correspond to their functions and offices under Canon Law, Admiralty Law, and Equity Law, all of which are Dishonored by their support of the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012), which serve to undermine the contractual basis of the American government as it is variously and respectively defined the government of the “United states” comprised of the District of Columbia, et alia, and as the government of the 50 States United.  In either case, the Right to Contract is a necessary First Right, without which no government at all is enabled to stand.  
            The obvious and purposeful obfuscation necessary to carry on the underlying constructive fraud  against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, by the Respondents, Secretary of the Treasury, and others acting as undeclared Foreign Agents, has created the purported existence of three different primary operant definitions of “United States of America” and as many recourses to Authority and as many forms of “citizen” and “government” as possible, but the Right to Contract and the Right to Due Process remain as the only basis granting credible existence to them all, and these are precisely the property interests of the Petitioners that are under attack via these Acts of Congress.
            We have come to the bedrock point----no matter how you “define it”----no lawful government exists without the assertion of the Petitioners’ Right to Contract.  Whether it is the right to contract “Under God” as proclaimed by the Catholic claim of Divine Right, or whether it is the right to contract as the Petitioners assert under Protestant Sovereignty, in no case is any government established absent the Right to Contract, not even the “Kingdom of God”. 
            Any action proposed against the Petitioners’ Right to Contract--as posed by the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) infringements, or as perverted and asserted by presumptions insinuated under conditions of fraud that claim “ownership” of the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, through unauthorized and illegal “pledges” made by other persons in the 1930’s to pay “debts” never owed by the Petitioners or their Progenitors, and as given a “legal” face in the form of “Birth Certificates” and “Marriage Licenses” and other Catholic abuses imposed upon the unwary Inhabitants of the 50 States United---is by definition an Act of Insurrection and Sedition and Treason against the lawful Protestant government instituted and required by Americans who now and forever claim their Sovereignty.
            The Petitioners assert that their status whether as US citizen or Natural born Citizen or shareholder respective to any of the three legal fictions, “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, et alia, the “United States of America” as defined as the 50 States United, or the “United States of America” defined as a “federal corporation” at Title 28, 3002, 15(A) (B) (C)-----are ALL without exception endangered and potentially nullified by the offending provisions already available in the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012) and incipient in the Enemy Expatriation Act. 
            Put simply, it no longer matters to which Authority the Respondents appeal, or under which definition of “United States of America” they propose to Act.  All these definitions of “United States of America”  require that the Petitioners have the Right to Contract and the Right to Due Process as a condition of their own existence.  In proposing to undermine the Petitioners’ Right to Contract and Right to Due Process, the Respondents unavoidably Dishonor all their Offices and extinguish their own Authority to Act.
            Moreover, in proposing to so far infringe upon the rights of the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, the Respondents are in flagrant violation of The Constitution of the United States of America as contract and duty owed to Natural born Americans, the Civil Rights owed US citizens, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as treaty and duty owed to Non-Foreign Human Beings.
            The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, have called upon the Offices of the Alaska Supreme Court, Inc., to issue a protective Writ of Habeas Corpus in opposition to the most egregious infringements, Bills of (Indefinite) Detainer, contained in the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) and to take action against the gross Fraud being practiced against the Petitioners and their lawful government by undeclared Foreign Agents, including the Respondents, the Secretary of the Treasury, and others since 1933.    
            The Petitioners have openly declared themselves to be victims of fraud practiced against them and their Progenitors on an international and ongoing basis.  They have demonstrated with full documentation exactly how this fraud was introduced and how it has been perpetuated and advanced and used in violation of Public Trust to benefit and enrich those undeclared Foreign Agents under contract to serve the Petitioners.  They have also demonstrated that the Public Oath of Office taken by the Respondents is to a Foreign and Catholic government which proclaims the Divine Right of Kings, a claim in open contradiction to the severely and obviously Protestant Sovereignty proclaimed by the Declaration of Independence and forever asserted by all lawful Americans. 
            The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, have declared that the Governors of the 50 States acting in 1933 in support of the “federal government” represented by the District of Columbia et alia, to “pledge” the “full faith and credit” of the Petitioners and their Progenitors possessed no such lawful granted Authority and that the Petitioners and their Progenitors owed no such “debt” accrued to any Foreign government, such that this claim and all legislation and agreement entered into on its basis is rendered void by fraud committed against the interests of the Petitioners and their lawful State governments. 
            These conditions created by fraud, usurpation, and presumption have led to the co-existence of two governments calling themselves the “United States of America” and the widely held belief that the Respondents, Members of Congress, hold a “dual allegiance” to both, when no such conclusion is in evidence and which would, if it existed, be in violation of both Public Law and Federal Code as cited.
            The Petitioners have also asked the Offices of the Alaska Supreme Court, Inc., to uphold the otherwise violated provisions of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to provide public service and acknowledgements related to these issues, and to refer these infringements for prosecution, including the additional charge of “seditious conspiracy” in behalf of US citizens and all others in federal jurisdiction, and to drop any claim that the Respondents have violated their “Oath of Office”, because given the nature and the allegiance and the identities invoked, it is clear that they have not violated their Oath of Office to the Foreign government known as the “United States of America” as defined as “the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, et alia….”  though they have moved against its existence via their attacks upon the right of “US citizens” to contract.
            In that regard, Petitioners have recognized that “US citizens” exist, and affirm that at least one Petitioner, an Inhabitant of Alaska, is consciously claiming “US citizenship” despite all the known hazards and disabilities currently associated with assumption of any such identity.  Owing however to the obvious disadvantages of “US citizenship” the Petitioners have also observed that there are relatively few know
