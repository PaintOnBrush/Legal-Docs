First to begin this is an actual court transcript. I had to pay about $150 or so for it.  The reason I HAD to pay was because my daughter didn't request it at the time she left.  She did get the petition to remove.  The petition was full of lies and so was what the CPS lady said about my daughter and the agent had no legal OR lawful (of course) jurisdiction to even begin this investigation.  Here is what happened to my family because I did not comply:
 
Characters: Petitioner = CPS agent
For Gal = Referee ( this is not the 'magistrate')
Stipes = Daughters court appt attn The Court = magistrate Defendant = my daughter. Also whereever you see words between these [ ] brackets that means them are my own words. Either I am removing a name or adding something for you to know that I feel is important to know as we are studying what to expect.The Court: This is in the matter of [Baby], case number 12-129411-NA; and from DHS we have?petitioner: NAME of CPS agentThe Court: Also present is?
 
Stipes: [NAME], or [NAME] for mom, defendant is mom, and Mr. [NAME] is the For Gal.
 
The Court: All right.  And I do have a petition in front of me asking that I authorize this petition, take jurisdiction over the child and issue an order to remove the child.
 
Petitioner: Correct
 
The Court:  Pusuant to the statute sited in the petition, the allegation as to mother, name and date of birth.  [Name of mom] is the mom to [baby], and at the time of filing this petition they resided in Genesee County.Mother gave birth on 9/14/2012 to [baby] and mother and baby were released from the hospital pending the Meconium results.
 
On 9/18/12, CPS received a referral stating [baby's] Meconium's (poop in diaper) tested positive mor marijuana [lie]. Mom reports having no knowledge as to who the father of Ariana could be.  Mom explanation was, quote, she went to a party, got high with other teenagers and Ariana happened.
 
On 9/18/12, a category 3 was opened with [mom], and [baby]was identified as the victim of physical abuse due to being drug positive at birth.Because [Mom] was not willing to accept services or allow CPS to have access to [baby], the risk level was heightened to a Category 1.On 9/28/12 [lie], a meeting was held at the home [mom] and [baby] at [address] [lie, this was to make it so the court would believe that my daughter was an adult when opening this case]This residence is the home of [mom]'s parents [me and my husband] who also reside in the home.
 
During the meeting [mom] and her parents were informed the baby tested positive for THC at birth [lie, she never informed us of the evidence that is what I based my whole reasoning for not complying on. I told her show me evidence of your accusations and I will comply; so did my daughter]. It was explained to [mom] and her parents that the CPS policy views all drug positive infants are victim of child abuse and CPS is to provide services. [lie; agent never explained this either during the initial attack by them they told us nothing they presumed everything was true and was completely vague].
 
A service agreement was signed by [mom, and parents] due to [mom] being a minor at the time of the meeting [ mom turned 18 on the 19th of September one day after the initial attack but notice the date]
 
Mom agreed to take random drug screens, contact CMH for a drug assessment and to receive a treatment plan if deemed appropriate by CMH. And lastly, to participate with Early-On [lie]As of this date and time [mom] refuses to comply. [Mom] refused to make herself or the baby available to CPS in any manner and has not cooorperated with the investigation of child abuse or neglect.[lie below; this is all a lie, made up, daughter had baby on 14th of September, left hospital on the 15th of September and never spoke to this woman] On 9/17/2012, [mom] spoke with [NAME], a social worker from Hamilton Community Health.  During the interview [mom] reported she had used marijuana on and off during the pregnancy, but denies any moderate to heavy use. [Mom] stated she used every day and a lot prior to her pregnancy.
 
[Mom] was provided information as to the effects of marijuana in the womb, and on infants.On 9/19/2012 [mom's birthday] [Mom] was referred for a drug screen to take at Woodward Counceling.  [Mom] reported she could not urinate due to pain from child birth and could not take the drug screen. [that is the truth but notice the date when she did that] How could she have known about the drug test on the 19th if the 28th is when she was told about it. Proof of the lies in here to cover up the fact they were here on the 18th a day before her birthday to trap also me and my husband]. CPS made the referral for Early-On and when Early-On called to set the appointment [mom] did not respond. [lie agent never mentioned early on just the drug screen and the therapy classes that mom had to call to set up.  She did call them but denied them what they wanted, her to admit she was a drug addict and sign up for classes.  She would not]On 9/24/2012, [mom] was a sent a certified letter explaining the seriousness of these allegations and a copy of the child protection law was also enclosed. [Mom&#125; never signed the letter.
 
[I had called on 9/24/2012 and told them that I was not going to allow my daughter to comply without a warrant and this is when the supervisor to the agent changed my daughter from a minor to an adult].
 
On 10/15/2012, CPS along with the Burton Police went to the home of -- at [address of mom], to provide [mom] with a copy of the letter, child protection law and CPS policy.On 10/15/2012, an arrangement was made to have [mom] and [baby] brought to DHS to meet with CPS between 9:00 and 9:30 in the morning-- the following morning [lie, what was arranged was a phone call to talk with her by my husband because my daughter was at work, but we did not tell them where she was].  On 10/16/2012, at 9:43 am [mom] called CPS and stated she was not coming to DHS and if CPS could show proof that she did something wrong then she would work with CPS, but not until then. [lie she never stated she was not coming to DHS]
 
[Mom] stated the court will have to make her participate in services.
 
On 10/16/2012 [mom] reported that she was stayig with friends. [lie, father stated that she was visiting family the night before with police as witness].
&#123;Mom] is not able to provide stable housing due to having no source of income. [she was at work when she came without a warrant to my home].[Mom] has not provided information as to where she is staying so [baby's] well being can be verified.There is an imminent risk of harm to [baby] that [mom] is again using a mild, mind-altering substance such as marijuana on a daily basis because, again, since she is no longer pregnant, living with friends, and not wanting to comply with CPS.
 
[Mom] reports feeding [baby] with her breast milk and if [mom] is smoking marijuana then [baby] could be ingesting THC.
 
It's respectfully requested that Genesee County Family Courts authorize this petition, take temporary jurisdiction of the minor child.  Order [mom] to comply with the DHS and allow DHS access to her residence.All right, [petitioner], if you will raise your right hand.  Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?Petitioner:  yes.
 
The Court: And if you could state your name and employment for the record.Petitioner: [NAME], Genesee County Child Protective Service Investigator.
 
The Court: And in course of your employment did you investigate the matter of [baby]?
 
Petitioner: I did.
 
The Court: As a result of that investigation did you cause this petition to be filed?
 
Petitioner: I did.
 
The Court: And are all of the allegations in this petition true to the best of your knowledge, information and belief?
 
Petitioner: They are.
 
The Court: All right.  Is there anything else you wanted tostate relative to the petition at this time? Petitioner: Other than we did speak with the doctor's office for [baby], and they stated that they informed [mom] early-on that she tested positive for THC and they also had referred her for drug assessment, and to this point she has not complied with them either. [lie, doctor of [baby] is the one who showed me the referral stating 'since a confirmation test was never performed this should be considered presumptive positive, for medical use only'; no jurisdiction EVER but the courts don't have the referral I don't believe]
 
The Court: And that was during the pregnancy or--
 
Petitioner: That--that was done, they--they did her--her drug test in February, so that would've been pretty close to either--
 
The defendant: That was-- [she was cut off I believe but she was stating she was lying]
 
Petitioner: --that is when they found out she was pregnant or--
 
Stipes: (Indistict - speaking to client)
 
The Court: um-mmPetitioner: --shortly after.
 
The court: Okay. Attorney Stipes.
 
Stipes: Okay. I'm going to have to follow up with that really quick and if I may.  She tested, doctor, whose doctor--may I inquire?
 
The Court:  Yes.
 
 			cross examination
 
Stipes: Who is Dr. Lawton?
 
Defendant: She's -- [ this is the baby's doctor but the transcriber did not put it in the '--' is the transcribers not mine. I believe them are interruptions in speech but unsure am getting the disc of the court hearing too to find out.]Petitioner: Doctor--Doctor Lawton is [mom's] OBGYN
 
Defendant: No, she's not. Petitioner: Oh, no, I'm sorry, that's--
 
Defendant: Pediatrician--
 
Petitioner: --the baby's pediatrician.
 
Stipes: So the--
 
Petitioner: Sorry--
 
Stipes: --this pediatrician reports mom tests positive, has a drug test positive for marijuana in February. [lie pediatrician had nothing on my daughter or mom. It was the OBGYN that had tested to see if she was pregnant in February. This is when I found out I was going to be a grandma.] Petition: Correct
 
Stipes: Okay.  You were at the home on the 18th, the mother's home on the 18th?
 
petitioner: yes.
 
Stipes: And did you see the baby on the 18th?
 
Petitioner: I did
 
Stipes: And did the baby appear to be in any kind of medical distress on the 18th?
 
Petitioner: On the 18th the baby was spitting up quite a bit, but other than that she was quite healthy.
 
Stipes:  Is it unusual for a byb to spit upPetitioner: (No verbal response)
 
Stipes: Okay. And on the 9--on the 9/28 you went to the home?
 
Petitioner: Correct
 
Stipes: And was the baby present?
 
Petitioner: no
 
Stipes: Okay. And was mom present? 
Petitioner: no
 
Stipes: Your honor, I--this is one of those petitions that we have a drug positive baby, in the Meconium, and--and mom-- if mom--I don't know if it says mom admitted to whatever, but if mom smoked pot and -- and then got pregnant, I know that marijuana stays in your system quite a while.When the baby is born drug positive, suffering no withdraws, in my opinion I don't think that there--then there is no--the baby is not harmed, if the baby is not suffering.  There is no proof that baby is suffering.
 
After speaking to my client and her--her mother, my client just turned 18-years old, and I spoke to her mother, baby is absolutely fine.  The problem with this case is they're not cooperating with CPS.  They have made CPS angry.  CPS comes to the door, they've got the police, they're after this young mom, They're wanting to see and rightful that's fine, it's their business to protect children and I respect that.  But now we have a young mom and we've got police at the door and the CPS is there, and they're like wait a minute, uh-uh, there is no--baby is fine, stay out of our lives, I--I understand that.  But that's the wrong to make because, you know, here we are.I don't see where the baby was harmed.  The baby was seen by the --Doctor Lawton three days after birth.  Doctor--these pediatricians certainly have a duty to report if the baby is being abused r neglected or--or iin danger.  There is nothing in this petition to say Dr. Lawton reported any problem.  I just don't see that there is probable cause to--to think that the baby has been harmed, is in danger.  Mom lives with her parents, she is not homeless.  She is with her mom and dad, she's got a 16 year old sister, and 14 year old brother.  I don't--this petition I don't think gives rise to authorization.
 
The Court: Okay.
Stipes: Don't see it.
 
The Court: Now, the doctor appointment with the pediatrician, that's not in these pleadings, is that correct, you're going off of her testimony?
 
Stipes: Yes. And I--
 
The Court: Or are you--
 
Stipes --you know, I can ask, I can, did you take the baby to the --have you taken the baby to the doctor--
 
The court: Well, you know, before--
 
The defendant: yes--
 
Stipes: --even go--
*****[THIS PART IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR EVERYONE GOING INTO A COURT]*******The Court:  --I even go any further--did you understand all of the allegations in this petition?
 
The defendant: No, well, half of it doesn't even make any sense.
 
The court: Well, did you under--
 
Stipes: (Indistinct - unclear)
 
The Court: --not if you agree with it, but did you understand the allegations?
Defendant: No not all of them.
 
The court: All right.******[The court is stuck, they cannot make a ruling because my daughter has not understood these allegations, for real, and cannot go any further but since my daughter continued they ended up getting jurisdiction]
*********
The defendant: Give me a second. I'm gonna look at these real quick.
[mistake but in her defense they were looking at her like she was retarded and just staring at her and she didn't know what else to do]
The Tricia (sic) lady, I don't ever remember speaking to--
 
The court: Okay. It don't matter if it's right or wrong--
 
Defendant: Okay--
 
The Court: --the whole petition--
 
Defendant: yeah--
 
The Court: --could be absolutely wrong--
 
Defendant: Okay--
 
The Court: --all I need to know is if you understood it when I read it--
 
Defendant: Okay, I understand it.
 
The Court: You did?
 
Defendant: Yes. [Take note on this this is very important for any court hearing not just on this one] 
 
The Court: Okay. You have the right to remain silent and not have that==that silence used against you, but if you choose to speak at this hearing today anything you say can be used against you, do you understand that right?
 
The defendant: Yes [again they needed jurisdiction for them to charge her. DO YOU SEE THEY JUST ARRESTED HER AND TOOK AWAY HER RIGHT OF PARENT HERE????]
 
The Court: You have the right to a trial by judge, a judge and jury, or referee.
you also have the right to review this referee's findings and conclusions, do you understand that right? [When my daughter asked to review the transcript they would not give it to her because she had been dismissed even though they said she had that right here]
 
Defendant: I do
 
The Court:  And you have the right to an attorney and if you or your parents, well, you're an adult now, if you cannot afford an attorney I can appoint one to represent you at public expense, do you understand that right?
Defendant (No audible response)
 
The Court: Okay. Now, Attorney Stipes.
 
Stipes: Yeah, I'm--I'm gonna ask that -- I don't know if she's an imminent risk of harm because she is again using a mind alternating--alternating substance on a daily basis again.  I don't see where that's coming from--
 
Defendant: How would she know?
 
Stipes: I don't know, I'm just -I'm gonna enter a denial.  I'm gonna ask that the Court not authorize this petition.  I don't see that the baby was harmed, is at risk of harm.  I don't think that--
 
The Court: Okay. [NAME, Referee] [This is the referee that is sitting in on the first case before the person is set up to see a judge, not magistrate but someone that is there like her]
 
Referee: Thank you, your Honor. Your honor, I--I agree with Stipes that the petition should not be authorized for a variety of--of-- of reasons.In looking at the petition, [mom] and her daughter were released from the hospital pending the meconiumtest which would lead one to believe that both mother and child did not test positive for any drugs in their systems at the time that they were released.  The meconium, as the court is aware of, will only show that there may have been drugs used at some point during the pregnancy and I believe it's during the last six, four to six months.  I'm not pretty certain as to the exact but--amount of time, but it's within that range.
 
So we don't have a--a--a baby who is positive, testing positive for drugs, nor do we have a baby, according to the petition, who was suffering from any withdrawals due to mother's drug use during her pregnancy.
 
****ANOTHER IMPORTANT STATEMENT BELOW MADE BY THIS REFEREE ABOUT CPS POWER.*****
 
The other--other issue that I have a problem with just like Ms. Stipes stated, you know, at this point [mom] does not have to cooperate with -- CPS, this is an adversarial process that they are beginning, she has a right to not cooperate with them and force them to bring the petition to court to see whether or not the Court is going to grant jurisdiction. [ ;~) hehe]
 
Additionally, I mean I--I hear, you know, that there has been talk with a doctor, I haven't seen anything that shows that a--a release of information has been signed, so they may be HIPPA violations there.  So I'm concerned about that and whether or not there has been an abuse of power with regard to getting information from a doctor that wasn't authorized.
 
So, I mean, as Ms. Stipes stated, her client just turned 18, it sounds like she's got a multitude of family that's involved with--with her, whether or not the family is cooperating with--the cepartment and--and, you know, you know, if the police showed up at--at my door telling me that they wanted to come in and--and, didn't have a--a warrant or any proof that they had the right to do that, I would also be saying no.  So, you know--
 
The Court: Okay--
 
Referee: -- I would ask the Court to--to deny authorization of the petition as well.
 
The Court: All right.  And is there anything else you wanted to state, [NAME,petitioner]
 
Petitioner:  No, your honor.
 
The court:  Okay. I--I also have a problem with the causation factor here because I don't know that the child, I don't have enough information to prove that the child is at imminent risk of current or future harm.
 
There-- if there is marijuana use then that has to be tied tothe parent's ability to parent the child, because a parent CAN smoke marijuana, it's when it becomes a problem in the parenting skills.So I am going to find that there is insufficient evidence in the allegations presented to warrant autorizing this petition, and I'll go ahead and dismiss it.  [End of transcript] 
 
[Notice the things that were said here]Do not give them anything if you are being attacked. Do not admit to UNDERSTANDING the allegations.
 
Marijuana can be used as long as there is no 'problems' caused by using it.
 
Also if anyone has ever been subjected to these proceedings because of ANY TYPE OF DRUG... do not take the drug test, do not sign the agreement they bring over and DON'T let them into your home unless they have authorization from court or warrant.  They cannot get a warrant unless a petition has been submitted and the court has probable cause.  Keep your children safe, God bless you all who may be attacked by these terrorists.With Love, Trudy Stergiopoulos
