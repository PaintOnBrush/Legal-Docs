By Greg Evensen December 20, 2008 NewsWithViews.comIntelligence  comes in two distinct and uniquely critical components. The first is  information—or intelligence—that comes from sources known to you as an  investigator or intercepted sources that may not be known to you. The  most critical intelligence sector is that of our own discerning creative  minds. Together, these two arenas comprise the data mine that gives us a  glimpse into the future. Military leaders and police officials know  that this future depends solely on how we assess that data and our near  miracle ability to shape outcomes by how we have collectively  interpreted all of the “leads.” If we are able to process correctly, the  police agency or forward military unit can deploy its forces based on  qualified assumptions that have been drawn from the available  “intelligence” and thus strike or defend effectively and  efficiently.Using this descriptive breakdown of the role of  intelligence, let’s project into 2009, and see what type of outcomes we  might expect over the next few months concerning the economic and  political events here in the United States.Let’s begin with what we do  know based on existing information and substantiated reports from across  the country. The executive branch of government assuming power on 20  January 2009 is comprised of the most socialist mindset since the  Roosevelt years. The cabinet and department executives reflect a bias  against historical constitutional precepts, are continuing programs or  are set on implementing new ones that will devastate the Bill of Rights  (what is left of it). They are viciously against the ownership of  personal defense weapons and are morally degenerate in their rabid  support of same-sex marriage, abortion, and homosexuality as a civil  right, as well as promoters of open borders with Mexico. This hideous  and brashly anti-traditional/historical America mindset in Washington  has completed the destruction of the bridge between our Godly heritage  and the present day four-lane interstate journey into oblivion and  destruction. Most of America has ridden this express train to hell, while  listening to I-Pods, lost on the cell phone, or addicted to demonically  inspired virtual games on the ever present lap-top. Family discussions  around the dinner table, parent involvement with their children’s school  and church, horseback camping trips and Christ honoring Christmas  gatherings, have given way to illicit sex parties, including pre-teen  homosexual experimentation encouraged by psychiatrists, cheating and  plagiarism rings in the public schools, gang affiliation in record  numbers, drug smuggling and dope dealing in every community in the  country. What then does our intelligence tell us? Based on these known  facts, we can conclude that America’s days as the “moral leader” to the  world are long over. Spiritually, we are worse off than the most  backward African nation that still worships rocks and trees. We have  offended the true God of the universe and are next in line for utter  destruction. That fate, I believe, is well underway. Even if you dismiss  the spiritual component, the results of our moral disintegration have  brought about its own unavoidable chain of events. Where moral character  is absent, corruption, theft, sexual immorality, lying, selfish and  traitorous conduct rushes in to fill the void. This is abundantly  evident on every hand in disease ridden America. The family has  disintegrated, churches have fallen away from God’s truth, government  has failed, banks have crumbled, credit has replaced “money,” debt  replaced “money” and “money” replaced gold and silver. Cowardice has  replaced confidence, incompetency has replaced competency, and mistrust  has taken over trust in the law and law officers. Virtue in the mission  of the military has been replaced with unending wars and police actions  by a now mercenary role for our soldiers who have been prostituted to  serve the whore of government. Any intelligence operation will predict  that this vast negative change in standards results in the defeat of the  nation from within. It cannot be avoided and its outcomes are  unavoidably predetermined. Such corruption then begins to feed on  itself. In order to protect the viability of the continuing operation of  such a flawed entity, a self-defense mechanism must then be established  to insure that the antithesis of the corrupted state (a morally  virtuous state) cannot be reinstituted.In the case of present day  America, this means the establishment of a previously unheard of and  unneeded police state apparatus. This internal security behemoth has  been built to protect the unconstitutional and corrupted national  government. This new Gestapo like state security network (homeland  security) is in a continuing state of expansion and invasion of the  private lives of Americans. It MUST do so, because it fears freedom,  honest citizens, and clean government. Only corrupted officials need  constant machine gun bearing black-clad killers in their employment.  Conversely, free, honest, government works shoulder to shoulder with its  citizens in an open concept where common sense and common integrity  rules.  Now our intelligence gathering abilities will conclude that in  order to staff such a police state army, men and women who have  themselves been corrupted will be the most likely to be recruited and  serve successfully. To be successful, they must voluntarily agree to  obey all rules and direct orders issued from the corrupted police or  general staffs which they serve. The future can be predicted then, that  at some point, those who have sworn to obey the corrupted state police  apparatus will come into direct conflict with those who have maintained  their personal morality, dignity, independence, and allegiance to God  and the Republic. There can be NO OTHER outcome. There is no road for  compromise or “sit-down” resolution. The ONLY outcome is conflict. The  state will maintain its “us against them” mentality and the freedom  fighters will have no choice but to survive by fighting back. This  scenario has been repeated throughout all of history on every continent  with the same inevitable, predictable ending. The maverick or rogue  element in all of this has begun to emerge in a way that gives us some  pause for hope, however. Vast amounts of information through patriot  radio, constitutionally sensitive internet news services and courageous  speakers across the country are bringing true and accurate facts to  millions of citizens and of course police officers and armed forces at  home and in theater. Because of these collective efforts, officers at  all levels are being made aware of the real situation facing all of us  and how they should respond—or not—to orders that will be coming to  them. The final segment of this article is directed to police and  military officers at all levels. It is as though roll call was underway  and the orders of the day issued. I ask that you read this carefully and  let it become a part of your standard operating procedures manual of  the heart. Your response to this will help decide the ultimate fate of  our nation. As sworn officers and oath bound military men and women, you  are under the lawful order domain that was codified for all time during  the Nuremburg Tribunals of 1945-48. That body decreed to all men and  women under arms that merely obeying orders of any kind was not an  affirmative defense for actions taken in combat or against civilian  populations. The benchmark that was established was, if the “order” was  criminal in nature or “required” the affected forces to commit an act  they knew was or suspected to be criminal in nature, they had the  absolute right and duty to disobey that order and in some cases seek the  immediate arrest and prosecution of the ordering authority. That  operational standard still exists and will be used should the occasion  arise in the near future. Let me be VERY clear. If a police officer from  any jurisdiction, private contractors hired to act as agents of the  police, or a military member acting in an “official” capacity should  carry out unlawful, unconstitutional, or unethical “orders” that  violates the effected person’s lawful rights, safety, security, or  freedom, then the offending “agent” of government is liable in court  both criminally and civilly. In the worse case situation, the offending  agent may be at the mercy of citizens who will not tolerate such  abuse. Resistance to such government actions by the citizenry in these  situations for the preservation of life and peace is therefore justified  in the extreme. We are left then with this “future” to contemplate.  Either intelligence will dictate that this nation’s constitutional laws  will be followed under all circumstances, or there will be severe  consequences both immediate and long term. Be it known that NO police or  military authority is exempt from safeguarding the American people from  violations of their absolute rights and that all such authority must be  lawful, constitutional, humane and fair. That any officer of the law or  of the military have as their first priority, the intelligent and  judicious use of their power, and the full knowledge that the Republic  of the United States and its people will hold them accountable and  responsible for their individual and collective actions in defense of  the American people during times of crises from whatever cause. Be it  further understood, that no President, General, Judge, Governor,  Attorney General, law enforcement official, legislator, public official  at any level or animal control officer may violate civil rights, the  Bill of Rights, the law, constitutional authority, or any other covenant  with the American people for any reason including open warfare. Any  such violation will be considered a violation of the official’s oath of  office and will be subject to civil and or criminal penalties. Good  intelligence is a useful tool in keeping the peace, safeguarding the  general population and using the law for the purposes it was intended.  Common sense is the gatekeeper for those laws and the maintenance of  civilization. Together we must insure that both intelligence and common  sense survive any application or misapplication of the law in any form  including that of martial law. No other course is acceptable. No other  course is lawful. No other course will insure that America survives its  present economic and political calamities without resorting to all out  conflict between its citizens and those in authority. Our future depends  on the intelligent use of our intelligence, from whatever source we  take it, and how we use it. We expect, indeed demand that those in  authority begin at once to exercise intelligent strength of character  and the wisdom to know from whence comes their strength. 2008 Greg  Evensen Greg Evensen is an award winning former Kansas State Trooper and  Kansas Marshal.
