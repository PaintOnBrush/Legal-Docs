RESTATED PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS 
Preamble 
In the course of preparing this Petition the Petitioners have undergone a rigorous process of research into arcane aspects of law and history.  The result is that we have become aware of issues and semantic usages that we were not aware of at the beginning of the petition process. In the interests of minimizing any resulting confusion, the Petitioners have consolidated the various parts and portions of the Petition presented in the Petition(s) meaning the Original and its Motion for Reconsideration, the Addendum to Petition, and the Addendum in Response Opposition, and herein Restate the whole of our Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus for the convenience of The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc., the Respondents, and all other Interested Parties. We, the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, request that this Restated Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus be substituted for all prior parts, portions, or versions, except that the original Motion for Reconsideration and Motion to Bar United States Attorney Entry stand apart and as written, with those related remedies and conclusions intact. 
 
I. General Information Pursuant to Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus
A. Place of confinement:  State of Alaska
B. Petitioner’s institutional address: 2366 Sopark Road, Big Lake, Alaska
 
II. SUBJECT OF THIS PETITION
A. Indicate the type of decision or action which you are challenging:
__________ Denial of parole
__________ Revocation of parole
__________ Disciplinary matter
__________ Revocation of good time credits
__________ Detainer
__________ Immigration or deportation order
_____X_____ Other (described briefly the type of decision or action involved)
 
This petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus is presented seeking injunctive relief from the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 (NDAA).  These Acts of Congress conspire in such a way that the Petitioners can now be (1) accused of undefined “belligerent acts” of “terrorism” and stripped of their citizenship and indefinitely detained under the Patriot Act and (2) subjected to indefinite detention without recourse to Due Process under the National Defense Authorization Act (2012), such that this Writ of Habeas Corpus and other means of relief would no longer be available to Petitioners if they were physically confined..
 
Under the Patriot Act an Alaskan can conceivably be “deemed” an “enemy combatant” for almost any infraction, stripped of their citizenship and detained indefinitely, because the subject of the legislation, “terrorism” and “belligerent acts” and acts of “support” are left to the interpretation of law enforcement and military agencies, respectively.  The National Defense Authorization Act further allows the military to indefinitely detain Alaskans merely under suspicion and does not require them to provide Due Process of Law.  
 
 An inhabitant of Alaska thus accused of “terrorism” whatever “terrorism” is “deemed” to mean by whatever local authority may be asserted to make that determination, may be denied their right to contract, stripped of their citizenship and its protections under the Patriot Act, and arbitrarily and indefinitely detained, creating the possibility that an inhabitant of Alaska could receive the administrative equivalent of a sentence of life imprisonment with no recourse to Due Process of Law.
 
Similarly, an inhabitant of Alaska could become subject to unlawful indefinite detention without recourse to Due Process of Law under the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012. 
 
The potential for abuse inherent in these combined Acts is enormous.  Only The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc.,, representing the de jure Supreme Court of the State of Alaska has the jurisdiction to provide relief and protection for Inhabitants of Alaska by issuing a Writ of Habeas Corpus.
 
B. Who made the decision or took the action?  The United States as represented by various members of the United States Congress, including the two named members of the Alaska US  Senate Delegation, Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich, and Don Young, US Congressman.
 
C. Date of decision or action?   The Patriot Act has been enrolled since 2002, and was extended in 2011 for four more years.  The National Defense Authorization Act (2012) has passed both Houses of Congress, and was signed into law by US President Barack H. Obama on December 31, 2011.
 
D. Was there a hearing of any kind? Yes ( ) No (X )
 
E. Were you represented by counsel or a staff member at any hearing?
Yes ( ) No (X )
 
F. Have you filed any previous lawsuit(s) related to your present claim?
Yes ( ) No (X )
 
 
III. DEFINITIONS, HISTORY, BIDDEN JURISDICTION, AND ISSUES OF SOVEREIGNTY
            In Brown v. Vasquez, 952 F.2d 1164, 1166 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 1778 (1992), the court observed that the Supreme Court has ";recognized the fact that`[t]he Writ of Habeas Corpus is the fundamental instrument for safeguarding individual freedom against arbitrary and lawless state action.' Harris  v. Nelson,  394 U.S. 286, 290-91 (1969). Therefore, the writ must be ";administered with the initiative and flexibility essential to insure that miscarriages of justice within its reach are surfaced and corrected."; Harris, 394 U.S. at 291.
            The Petitioners hereby asserted their right to contract and to receive due process of law, among other rights guaranteed and secured by public contract with the State of Alaska, Inc., and by subrogation also guaranteed and secured by public contract with the “United States of America”, aka, the “US Corporation.”  Petitioners have demonstrated that material harm will result and accrue to them personally if their rights are infringed or denied under the Patriot Act as Extended and/or the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, as detainment under either Act of Congress would result in incalculable mental, physical, and material suffering demonstrated in loss of health, loss of mental and emotional stability and well-being, loss of income, loss of employment,  loss of other properties, such as their homes, and every other specific benefit of freedom.    Petitioners have therefore demonstrated that both inherent rights and contractual rights stand subject to harm by these Acts of Congress.
            As the United States District Court has properly and always maintained, in matters alleging and disputing infringement of rights and immunities guaranteed to Alaska Inhabitants under the public contract known as ”The Constitution of the United States of America”, the only Domestic appellate court of mediation having the authority and obligation to act in favor of Alaska Inhabitants, including the Petitioners, is that of The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc.,. Specifically, only The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc., has the power to issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus to protect the Inhabitants of Alaska from the threat of an unlawful Bill of Detainer resulting from either of two Acts of Congress.
            The Petitioners have demonstrated standing before the only court having natural jurisdiction and we assert our right to Due Process including the right to file the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus presented herein.
            Since 1789, the “(U)nited States of America” has existed by the right to contract, beginning with the inherent right of the Inhabitants to contract to create and inhabit those legal fictions known as “States”, and from thence, enabling the States to contract to form, limit, and create the “United States of America” dba  “US Corporation” and “Federal government” in itself another legal fiction deriving its existence and Authority to Act solely from the subrogated right of the Inhabitants to contract.
            The Rights and Authorities of the Petitioners have been subrogated under contract to The Constitution of the United States of America since 1933, but not annihilated nor extinguished. Likewise, their capacity as Sovereigns has not been compromised by the failure of the 50 States to bear representation in de jure capacity as a result of bankruptcy.  In the absence of performance under contract by the State of Alaska, Inc., or the US Corporation acting as commercial proxies representing (themselves as) the de jure government, Petitioners are fully enabled to recall and assert both their subrogated rights and their Sovereignty.
            Since 1933, both Federal and State levels of the American government  have been incorporated, and the former public compact known as “The Constitution for the united States of America” has been translated to the public contract known as  “The Constitution of the United States of America”;  since 1938,  per US Supreme Court decision in Erie Railroad v. Thompkins, all public commerce has existed only by contract, such that the only recourse to Due Process is by the exercise of contracts between both living and corporate persons. 
            Thus when living Inhabitants of a State seek protection of rights and immunities guaranteed under The Constitution of the United States of America we are disputing a public contract held under association by subrogation.  The Natural-born State Nationals, aka, “State Citizens” have contracted as Sovereigns with the corporation known as The State of Alaska, Inc., and under their Authority and by their agreement, the State of Alaska has likewise contracted with a corporation known as The United States of America, Inc., aka, “US Corporation” to provide certain enumerated services spelled out in the public contract known as The Constitution of the United States of America. 
            The Officers of the State of Alaska, Inc.,  owe the Petitioners, the due Sovereigns and other Inhabitants of Alaska, the first duty to perform under contract, as the States asserted the Petitioners’ delegated Authority as parties to the contract under dispute.   While the Inhabitants retain their rights and all Authority under subrogation and do not currently hold the contract(s) creating these legal fictions fulfilled, the State of Alaska, Inc., and its Officers must be given both Notice and Opportunity to fulfill their obligations.
            This Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus presented to The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc., again, a corporate proxy representing and substituting itself for the de jure Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, together with  our assertion that we are Unimpeded Sovereigns and as Sovereigns that we are suffering harm as a result of contractual infringement, bids forth the natural jurisdiction of The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska and no other, meaning that natural and pre-eminent jurisdiction possessed by The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, as the highest domestic court of appeal and mediation now represented by the corporate proxy court known as “The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc.,” and requires the exercise of that jurisdiction. Our standing and proper jurisdiction asserted grants the natural jurisdiction so summoned to The  Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc., and the Individual State Offices held by the Justices of The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc. and provides opportunity to protect the interests of the Petitioners.
            Absent such opportunity to protect, assert, and enforce the contractually guaranteed rights and property interests of the Inhabitants of Alaska, the State of Alaska, Inc, is unable to fulfill its own contractual and fiduciary obligations.
            If these public contracts are breached, namely, The Constitution of the State of Alaska and The Constitution of the United States of America, all subrogated rights and interests revert to the Inhabitants; all Authorities granted first to the State of Alaska, Inc., and secondarily to the US Corporation also revert to the Inhabitants. Both of these public contracts, The Constitution of the State of Alaska and The Constitution of the United States of America can be voided by Dereliction of Duty and Willful Failure to Perform, such that the State of Alaska, Inc., and the US Corporation, may lose granted Authority to Act if prompt and appropriate action is not taken to protect the property interests of the Petitioners.   
            Thus the Petitioners’ right to be free from unlawful Bills of Detainer, and their receipt of a Writ of Habeas Corpus which preserves their most valuable property interests under contract in the face of infringing legislation, involves bedrock upon which the Petitioners, the State of Alaska, Inc., and the US Corporation all depend, and it is equally in the interest of all parties to preserve.
            The Petitioners who are Natural born citizens of other Foreign States, meaning States having Statehood prior to 1933 or prior to 1861, and/or States asserting restored de jure status, and also those Petitioners who legally assumed “US citizenship” and claim “civil rights” under the 14th Amendment to The Constitution of the United States of America,  and more generally, all Alaskans  possessing “Non-Foreign” citizenship, are initially dependent on the State of Alaska, Inc., and its Officers to perform under contract and act in their behalf. The Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, assert their retained Rights and Authorities held under subrogation and demand performance under contract.  Failure to perform yields a contract in breach.
            For governments as for individuals, failure to meet contractual obligations has consequences.
             The Justices of the Supreme Court of Alaska, Inc.,  are uniquely empowered to act in behalf of the State of Alaska, Inc., and the Inhabitants thereof when a conflict arises between the Inhabitants of the State and the US Corporation and its Officers over infringing legislation. The Officers of The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc. are the only ones empowered to grant immediate and effective relief to the Petitioners and other Inhabitants of Alaska who are threatened by unlawful Bills of Detainer.
            Such conflict has arisen.  The Officers of the US Corporation, including the Respondent members of Congress, have voted to ignore the provisions of the public contract under which the US Corporation operates and from which it proposes to derive its sole Authority to Act, The Constitution of the United States of America, by passing and enacting repugnant Acts of legislation, including the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012.   
            The State of Alaska, Inc., and its Officers have thus far failed to respond to these infringements and presumptions, such that the contracts governing our State and our Nation are left unenforced to such an degree that the Inhabitants of Alaska, including the Petitioners, are recklessly endangered, with life and property at risk, and none of the Petitioners’ own granted Authority has been extended to protect them and their property interests.
            Petitioners assert that “a law “beyond the power of Congress,” for any reason, is “no law at all.” Nigro v. United States, 276 U. S. 332, 341 (1928), and yet, any attempt to enact unlawful laws must be rebutted, or these same unlawful public policies will be translated into statute and regulation and stand by presumption.  Lack of rebuttal by the State of Alaska, Inc. and its Officers combined with gross presumption on the part of the US Corporation and its Officers, have led to the endangerment of the Petitioners, such that the Petitioners hold both public contracts, The Constitution of the State of Alaska and The Constitution of the United States of America, unfulfilled and potentially voided. 
            Petitioners have served a proper Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus on the natural jurisdiction of The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska  being represented by the corporate proxy known as The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc.,   This natural jurisdiction is uniquely suited to hear this Petition.
            A Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus has no existence outside of appeals from other actions, in this case, infringing legislation, and so is an “appellate matter” by definition.  The natural jurisdiction of The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska is an appellate venue.  A Writ of Habeas Corpus is the proper opposition to a Bill of Detainer, such as those the Petitioners object to, and issuance of such a protective Writ is entirely and well-within the jurisdiction of The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc.. 
            The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska’s natural jurisdiction as bidden by the Petitioners and now represented by proxy by The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc.,, is that of a Domestic court of mediation.  These are important distinctions favorable to the adoption of this venue and jurisdiction, as shall be further discussed within the Grounds of this Petition. For now, let us observe that natural jurisdiction of The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc., is Domestic with respect to the Petitioners, as opposed to Foreign, and that this court is tasked with mediation, rather than inhabiting foreign administrative jurisdictions.
            Petitioners realize that the State of Alaska Inc. has adopted Rules with respect to the application of the Writ of Habeas Corpus, but for the purposes of this action, we request consideration and application of the Writ under the provisions of Equal Protection, and ask that The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc., apply the Writ of Habeas Corpus as it is more liberally applied and interpreted in the States of New York and Pennsylvania, where the Writ is applied in any instance wherein the Petitioner’s Rights and freedoms are restrained, and without any requirement that they be incarcerated or that their request derive from any prior existing court case.  
            Please note this important point, that we are specifically moving to set aside the State of Alaska’s Rules regarding Writ of Habeas Corpus, and requesting the adoption of the Rules of the State of New York or State of Pennsylvania in this matter, and invoking the Equal Protection provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America. 
 
             “Let it be known to all men and women of these United States that ";Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any state or territory, subjects or causes to be subject, any citizen of these United States or other person to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."; (Civil Rights) 42 U.S.C. 1963.
            “Let us, We the People be perfectly clear in our position on this issue. We the People rely on the ruling from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals which has held that public officials/agents of the government do not have immunity simply because they operate in a discretionary manner. It indicated that public servants are to be held liable when they abused their discretion or acted in a way that was arbitrary, fanciful, or clearly unreasonable. (Civil law) Littleton v. Berbler, 468, F. 2d, 389 (1972).
            Our request for Equal Protection may not be set aside. 
            We have already made reference in the process of delineating the jurisdiction we are establishing to the circumstance in which we find ourselves, i.e., that we are dealing with a multitude of “government entities” and corporate proxies representing government entities.  These complex and often unstated relationships are the result of three separate actions: (1) adoption of the 14th Amendment to The Constitution for the united States of America in 1868, (2) the Supreme Court decisions known as Downes v. Bidwell and Hooven and Allison Company v. Evatt in 1901, and (3) Reorganization in 1933.  
            The 14th Amendment to the organic Constitution created a new class of citizen, “US citizens”.  This brand of citizenship was conferred by the federal government as a privilege extended to former Black Slaves freed as a result of the Emancipation Proclamation and the end of the Civil War, also known as the War of Secession.  Because this citizenship was established by the government, it cannot and does not take reference to any “Natural Rights” as proclaimed by the Declaration of Independence.  Instead, it confers “Civil Rights”.  These civil rights were by no means equal to the Natural Rights enjoyed by white Natural-born State Nationals, a circumstance that gave rise to the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960’s, and the demand for Equal Civil Rights, which was finally guaranteed as a result. Eventually, the federal government presumed to claim other Americans as “US citizens”, including those in its employment, members of the active military, those born in the Territories, etc.  We will note in passing that there is a third brand of citizenship known as “Non-Foreign citizen” represented by Aboriginal inhabitants, who have Human Rights as declared by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  This Petition and the Petitioners represent all three manner of “citizen” inhabiting the geographically defined State of Alaska.  
            The process of claiming American Natural-born State Nationals as “US citizens” and significant other mischief was given a substantial boost by two 1901 Supreme Court cases.  In  Downes v. Bidwell, Congress was given importunate rule over the Territories, such that it was allowed to operate without respect to the Constitution in those areas, making inhabitants of the Territories “subject” to Congress in the same way that British inhabitants are subjects of the King.  In Hooven and Allison Company v. Evatt, this empowerment was extended to cover all inhabitants living in “federal jurisdiction”, howbeit, that jurisdiction must be defined and may not be presumed once challenged.  
            These two decisions effectively created two separate national-level governments, both overseen by Congress, one a virtual Congressional dictatorship, and the other, the government serving the “Several States”, now 50 States, under the limits of The Constitution of the United States of America.   This circumstance is at least locally well-known in the District of Columbia and to bankers, tax professionals, and investment counselors generally, but has been obscured from broad public knowledge by the adoption of a purposefully misleading semantic convention. Two versions of “United States of America” were arbitrarily defined: (1) the “United States of America” as defined by “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the American Virgin Island, Guam, American Samoa….et alia”  and (2) the “United States of America” defined as the 50 States United. 
            The obvious conflicts of interest inherent in such a situation where one legislative body is entrusted with the administration of two substantially different national governments were apparent from the very beginning.  
            In Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244 (1901)  we quote Justice Marshall Harlan writing in dissent:  ";…two national governments, one to be maintained under the Constitution, with all its restrictions, the other to be maintained by Congress outside and independently of that instrument, by exercising such powers as other nations of the earth are accustomed to…a radical and mischievous change in our system of government will result…We will, in that event, pass from the era of constitutional liberty guarded and protected by a written constitution into an era of legislative absolutism…It will be an evil day for American liberty if the theory of a government outside the supreme law of the land finds lodgment in our constitutional jurisprudence.";  
            We have indeed come to that day, wherein presumption has allowed the “United States of America” defined as “….the District of Columbia, et alia” dba the “US Corporation” to assert dominion far apart from the contractual limits and obligations that are owed to all Natural-born State Nationals and has served to allow them also to propose to arbitrarily alter the civil rights owed “US citizens” who are Inhabitants of the State of Alaska The absence of due diligence on the part of the State of Alaska, Inc. evident in the absence of objection to these presumptions and obvious infringements of public contract, and the overall failure to assert the contractual rights of the Inhabitants and defend the property interests of the Inhabitants of Alaska, as is due under The Constitution of the State of Alaska, is a secondary result of the “dual government” system created by these 1901 decisions and a primary result of the “Reorganization” that took place in 1933.  
            These issues are at the very heart of the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus being presented, and provide both the historical cause and the context for our Petition.  This brings us to the “Reorganization” of 1933. 
               The infringements of the Petitioners’ Right to Contract, Right to Due Process, and specifically, their right to assert their Contract of Citizenship enacted against the Petitioners by the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012), reveal that these current infringements against the public obligations of the Respondents are part and parcel of other prior actions taken against the Petitioners and their Progenitors.  The passage of the Patriot Act and the offending provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 merely mark “another chapter” in a long process of governmental fraud, deceit, infringement, usurpation, presumption, and improper claims of “emergency powers” by the Respondents from which Petitioners seek immediate and material relief.
               The United States  defined as “…the District of Columbia et alia” went ";Bankrupt"; in 1933 and was declared so by President Roosevelt in Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111, and finally, as consolidated in Executive Order 6260, (See: Senate Report 93-549, pages 187 &amp; 594) under the ";Trading With The Enemy Act"; (Sixty-Fifth Congress,  Sess. I, Chs. 105, 106, October 6, 1917), and as codified at 12 U.S.C.A. 95a.
               The several States of the Union then pledged the faith and credit thereof to the aid of the National Government, and formed numerous committees, such as the ";Council of State Governments";, the ";Social Security Administration";, etc., to purportedly deal with the economic ";Emergency"; caused by the bankruptcy. These organizations operated under the ";Declaration of Interdependence"; of January 22, 1937, and published some of their activities in ";The Book of the States.";
               The Reorganization of the bankruptcy is located in Title 5 of the United States Code Annotated. The ";Explanation"; at the beginning of 5 U.S.C.A. is most informative reading.  The ";Secretary of Treasury"; was appointed as the ";Receiver"; in Bankruptcy.  (See: Reorganization Plan No. 26, 5 U.S.C.A. 903,  Public Law 94-564, Legislative History, pg. 5967)  As a Bankrupt loses control over his business, this appointment to the ";Office of Receiver"; in bankruptcy had to have been made by the ";creditors"; who are ";foreign powers or principals";. As revealed by Title 27 USC 250.11 and elsewhere, the Secretary of the Treasury is the Secretary of the Treasury of Puerto Rico, an Officer of the Commonwealth version of the “United States of America” who was designated as the “Receiver” in bankruptcy by the Foreign Creditors (banks).
               The United States as Corporator, (22 U.S.C.A. 286E, et seq.) and ";State"; (C.R.S. 24-36- 104, C.R.S.  24-60-1301(h)) declared ";Insolvency.";  (See: 26 I.R.C.  165(g)(1), U.C.C.  1-201(23), C.R.S. 39-22--103.5, Westfall vs.  Braley, 10 Ohio 188, 75 Am. Dec. 509, Adams vs. Richardson, 337 S.W.  2d 911; Ward vs. Smith, 7 Wall. 447)
                A permanent state of ";Emergency"; was instituted within the Union and the Federal Reserve has acted as the ";fiscal and depository agent"; of the “creditors” ever since. Please note that the member banks of the Federal Reserve are all privately owned corporations, 22 U.S.C.A. 286d.
               The government, by becoming a “corporator” (See:  22 U.S.C.A. 286e)  lays down its sovereignty and takes on that character and status of a private citizen. It can exercise no power which is not derived from the corporate charter.  (See: The Bank of the United States vs. Planters Bank of Georgia, 6 L.  Ed. (9 Wheat) 244, U.S. vs. Burr, 309 U.S. 242). 
               The Corporate Charter adopted by the “federal corporation”, aka, US Corp, included The Constitution of the United States of America as its By-Laws. The Constitution of the United States of America remains also as a public contract, which the Petitioners assert is owed enforcement by the State of Alaska, Inc.
                The real party in interest is not the de jure ";United States of America"; or ";State";, but ";The Bank"; and ";The Fund.";  (22 U.S.C.A. 286, et seq., C.R.S. 11-60-103) These acts committed under fraud, force, and seizure are many times done under ";Letters of Marque and Reprisal"; i.e. ";recapture."; (See: 31 U.S.C.A. 5323)  in behalf of Foreign governments at war. This is an important point to remember as this discussion goes forward in time.
               On March 17, 1993, on page 1303 of Volume 33 of the Congressional Record, Congressman Traficant stated:  ";Mr. Speaker, We are now here in Chapter 11.  Members of Congress are official Trustees presiding over the greatest reorganization of any bankrupt entity in world history, the U.S. Government.";
               The “U.S. government” is the government domiciled in the District of Columbia, which at various times purports to represent three distinct entities: (1) the US Corporation formed as we have just seen and as documented at Title 28, 3002, (15) (A) (B) (C), (2) the “United States of America” defined as the 50 States United or “the Union of 50 States”, and (3) the “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia. In this comment Congressman Traficant was including all three primary meanings of “U.S. Government” as the term “General Government” or “U.S. Government” with a capital “G” is traditionally used in the Congressional Record when this meaning is applied----however, there is no indication that the Several States were ever “bankrupted” except as voluntary adjuncts.
               The actual entity in bankruptcy was the foreign government allowed under the Downes and Bidwell decision, also known as the “United States of America” but defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia.  Like “South America” these “states” can claim to be “American” and they can form a “Union” of their own, and using the same name,  “United States of America” allowed a great deal of self-interested confusion and corruption.
               A preponderance of the Governors of the Several (now 50) States at that time simply agreed to “stand good” for the bankruptee, pledging the “full faith and credit” of their States and the citizenry of their States, thereby choosing voluntarily to engage the States and their inhabitants in the bankruptcy proceedings.
               This same “bankruptcy” has never been settled.  It is ongoing to this very day.  Its immediate effect was to transfer control of the “United States of America” domiciled in the “District of Columbia” and the de jure “United States of America” represented by the Several States (now 50) as parties to the bankruptcy, into the hands of the Creditors (the Federal Reserve Banks and later IMF and IBRD) and their Agents administering the bankruptcy under the authority the Secretary of the Treasury of Puerto Rico. 
               Timothy Geithner is “Secretary of the Treasury” acting as a Foreign Agent, required to file a Foreign Agents Registration Statement, administering this “bankruptcy” in behalf of the Creditors.  He is in no way, shape, or form related to the legitimate Department of the Treasury of the United States of America, which has been reduced to a vestigial organization located in the State of Georgia.
               This confession by Congressman Traficant concerning the bankruptcy applies, not only to ";Members of Congress,"; but also to the Secretary of the Treasury as the ";Receiver in bankruptcy"; and to all state and federal ";officials"; who act under the de facto authority of  that bankrupt Foreign Corporation known as the United States acting as Trustees (that is, Foreign Agents) for foreign principals.  Trustees work for the creditors of a bankruptcy and are agents for foreign principals.
               In this case the creditors are the Federal Reserve Banks, the International Monetary Fund (the Fund) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank).
               (All United States Attorneys are required to file a ";Foreign Agents Registration Statement"; pursuant to 22 U.S.C.A 611c(1)(iv) &amp; 612), when representing the interests of a Foreign Principal or Power. (See: 22 U.S.C.A. 613, Rabinowitz vs. Kennedy, 376 U.S. 605, 11 L. Ed. 2d 940, 18 U.S.C.A. 219 &amp; 951).  This same requirement was later extended to non-attorney representatives as required by Trinsey v. Pagliaro.  As a result, every official and every attorney representing this version of “federal government”, and including the Respondents, is a Foreign Agent and under obligation to declare him or herself as such and file the Foreign Agents Registration Statement.  United States Attorneys are also required to have a properly delegated and identified living non-attorney representative of the foreign corporation(s) he represents standing as Party to the action and subject to cross-examination throughout any trial or opposition to any action at law.  Trinsey v. Pagliaro explicitly prohibits the use of attorneys as substitute injured parties and the arguments written or oral of any attorney in the absence of such declared non-attorney corporate representative is insufficient to carry any cause of action. All United States Attorneys are required to clearly state and delineate all attorney-client relationships and provide The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc., with this proper documentation prior to entering any proceedings related to this Petition.)
               The contrived ";emergency"; of the bankruptcy has created numerous abuses and usurpations, and abridgments of delegated Powers and Authority as clearly stated in Senate Report 93-549 (1973):
               ";A majority of the people of the United States have lived all of their lives under emergency rule.  For 40 years, [78 years now] freedoms and governmental procedures guaranteed by the Constitution have in varying degrees been abridged by laws brought into force by statutes of national emergency.";
               The current Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus has arisen under precisely this circumstance. The Respondents are claiming that they have Authority to arbitrarily and indefinitely detain Americans without recourse to Due Process, based on unproven allegations of “belligerent acts” against the corporate government. Once again, these infringements are being asserted as a response to an “emergency” situation that doesn’t really exist.
               According to 16 American jurisprudence, 2nd Edition, Sections 71 and 82, no ";emergency"; justifies a violation of any Constitutional provision.  Arguendo, ";Supremacy Clause"; and ";Separation of Powers";, yet it is clearly admitted in Senate Report No.  93-549, that abridgment has occurred.
               On March 6, 1933 the federal government got the Conference of Governors to pledge the full faith and credit of the several States of the Union and their citizenry to the aid of the National Government, (see pp. 18 - 24 of The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin Roosevelt, Volume II, The Year Of Crisis, March 6, 1933) for what they openly admitted to doing. They also encouraged the President to ask for and use extra-constitutional powers during the ";emergency"; that continues to this day. 
               This was a completely voluntary action on the part of the Governors acting at that time representing the (now) 50 States United which were never the subjects of the bankruptcy at all.  The Governors arbitrarily claimed to have the granted Authority to commit the full faith and credit of the 50 States and also claimed the Authority to add the full faith and credit of the State’s “citizenry” as credit in behalf of the “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia, dba “US Corporation”.   
               The Governors had no such granted Authority. It was fraud on the face of it for them to pledge the faith and credit of the State, which they did not own, as collateral. Likewise it was purely fraudulent for the Governors to claim “ownership” of the citizenry of the State, or claim any granted Authority or possession of any inherent right to commit the “full faith and credit” of the citizenry, Inhabitants, of the Several (now 50) States in payment of the debts of a Foreign Corporation. 
               The Inhabitants of the 50 States United are and were private and unincorporated living entities, who never acted or granted authority to anyone to act in their behalf in this manner whatsoever. They (and we) never gave permission to any entity to define them (us) as corporate entities, nor as “debtors” subject to the bankruptcy proceedings of any Foreign Corporation.   The Petitioners and their Progenitors never gave their consent to this action undertaken by the Governors and were for the most part never even made aware of it.
               There has sometimes been an assumption that the Governors were acting under a special law or regulation and that they were entitled to exercise it in the face of an “emergency”, but such is not and never has been the case.
               ";Emergency does not create power.  Emergency does not increase granted power or remove or diminish restrictions imposed upon power granted or reserved.  The Constitution was adopted IN a period of grave emergency.  Its grants of power to the Federal Government and its limitations of the power of the States were determined in the light of emergency and they are not altered by emergency."; [Emphasis added] Home Building &amp; Loan Assoc. v  Blaisdell 290 US 426 (1934).
               The Governors acting in 1933 and the Respondents, Members of Congress, acting now have no “special” or “extra” powers during an emergency, declared or undeclared, yet that is what they specifically and dishonestly claimed in 1933 and what they are continuing to claim as the excuse for their infringements against The Constitution of the United States of America today.  Likewise the Governors of the 50 States United acting in 1933 had no new, special, different, or greater claim upon the resources of their States or upon the Citizens of those States as a result of any economic emergency.
     ";The Constitution of the United States is a LAW for rulers and people equally in war and peace,  and covers with the shield of its protection ALL classes of men, at ALL times, and under ALL circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was EVER invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of the government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or to despotism."; [Statement of Opinion, U.S. Supreme Court, Annals 1866, in response to a new class of proposed infringing Reconstruction legislation that was similarly promoted on the basis “national emergency”.]
               Likewise, powers and property interests that the Governors didn’t possess prior to the “emergency” did not magically accrue to them as the result of any emergency, economic or otherwise. Their action pledging the “full faith and credit” of the 50 States and their citizenry was pure fraud and extortion practiced at the level of State government.  As in all cases of fraud, the victims were not notified of any such agreement being made in their behalf, for the simple reason that the Citizens of the now 50 States if allowed to consider their options, would never have agreed. 
               The property interests of the 50 States United, their land and resources, including the “full faith and credit” of the citizenry so gratuitously offered by the treasonous Governors, was the collateral accepted by the creditors (foreign principals) so the “federal government” aka, “United States of America” as defined as “the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam…et alia” could borrow more Federal Reserve Notes (private bank credit) and keep operating under reorganization.  Roosevelt issued Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111 and 6260:
               Executive Order 6073 issued on March 10, 1933, created the ";bank holiday"; and closed the doors of the bankrupt government chartered banks (they were bankrupted as a whole because they operated under government charter, and because of the Great Fraud committed by the Governors of the several States, not because they were individually bankrupt).
               Executive Order 6102  issued on April 5, 1933,  prohibited ";hoarding"; gold and required people to turn it (their property) in to the Federal Reserve Banks (the creditors).
               Executive Order 6111 issued on April 20, 1933, prohibited people from exporting gold.
               The affects of this particular Executive Order provide clear and trenchant proof of the fraudulent nature of the claim and the purposeful intent of the foreign government and the Foreign Creditors exerting it. The creditors claimed that all the gold in private hands in the Several (now 50) States no longer belonged to the State Citizens and other Inhabitants, as a result of having been pledged by their State Governors, and this gave rise to one of the first dire results of the many illegal actions taken under the auspices of the “Reorganization” which we will hereinafter call the “Great Fraud”.          
               The “United States” represented by the District of Columbia, et alia, acting in favor of the Foreign Creditors did indeed seize the gold of Americans and claimed—fraudulently---to assert the credit of the States and citizenry as cited, but because they had to remain in Honor internationally and create a “remedy” equal to the public liability they established, they set up a system whereby the people so defrauded got to charge off all bills presented to them via a process of “debt” forgiveness known as Accepted for Value, administered by the Internal Revenue System and tied to the Social Security program.
               Each Social Security Number is illegally used by the IRS as a “Tax Identification Number”, representing a “debt” account.  For these purposes the familiar XXX-XX-XXXX format is used.  At the same time, the same number without dashes is used to set up a “credit” account, also administered by the Internal Revenue Service.
               Of course, the same government responsible for the thefts and false claims to begin with never bothered to mention this “generous” accommodation to the victims.  Only those who were part of the sting were able to discharge their debts. Everyone else got stuck paying double to the banks. 
               The banks acted as both Foreign Creditors and Domestic Brokers in this whole proceeding and pressed the victims to pay them coming and going----first by providing the banks with “debt credit” in the form of “checks” and secondly by charging off the victim’s “debt” using the Accepted for Value process that was supposedly put in place to repay Americans for the confiscation of their gold and their credit.
               As one common and particularly egregious example, under this system the Promissory Note signed by people applying for a mortgage is (unknown to them) legal tender.  The bank or other “mortgage broker” charges off the full value of the supposed “loan” as being “Accepted for Value” against the person’s Bonded Credit Account, and then, turns around, pretending that they have actually risked their own money and given the victims a “loan” the banks demand repayment of a “debt” that has already been discharged, plus 30 years of interest, insurance, and so on. 
               Between the tender mercies of the frauds perpetrated by the “federal government” and the self-interested rape by the banks, Americans were immediately deprived of most of their resources and net worth, even though they were (and are) self-evidently the only source of wealth creation for all the predatory legal fictions represented by the “federal government” and the “banks” and the “banking associations”. The text of this whole arrangement is recorded in H.J. Res 192, 73rd Congress, First Session, principally prior enrolled as Public Law, U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 1, Public Acts, 3rd Congress, 2nd Session, Chapter 48. 
               Anyone doubting the truth of this has only to haul out their “check” book and read the very, very fine microprint embedded in the broken line below their signature confirming that the Signature on their check is the “Authorizing” Signature, i.e., authorizing the bank to consider them a “banker” as recorded in Title 12 of Federal Code and to (mis)use their authority to both create the debt credit and the debt discharge, a process known as “twinning” which is extremely illegal, but left to be practiced without oversight or audit of the Federal Reserve Banks.  
               Nobody but the Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for oversight of these “debt accounts” as in “government debt accounts” and he is acting solely in behalf of the foreign creditors, so the ability to carry out fraud, extortion, and financial conversion against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, has been limited only by the extent of their ignorance and will to survive.
               Executive Order 6260 issued on August 20, 1933, combined 6102 and 6111.
               All of this is criminal and self-interested fraud, extortion, unlawful conversion, and treason against The Constitution of the United States of America and against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska. 
               The Governors of the 50 States acting at that time pledged the PUBLIC property of the State, which they didn’t own, and the PRIVATE property of the State Citizens, property over which they had no reasonable authority and upon which they had no valid material claim, to be surrendered in payment of the debts racked up by the “United States of America” as defined by the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia, and so confiscated private property to pay public “debts”  that were, generally speaking,  never owed by the Citizens of any of the 50 States, all under color of law and a contrived economic “emergency” and in behalf of a Foreign government and Foreign Creditors. 
               The economic raping and pillaging created by the Great Fraud has continued unabated to the present day.  The proclamations issued by FDR gave force to 470 provisions of Federal “law”.  These hundreds of statutes delegate to the President extraordinary powers, ordinarily and meant to be exercised by a representative Congress, which affect the lives of Americans, including Alaskans in a host of all-encompassing manners.  These unconstitutional powers, taken together, confer enough authority to rule the country without reference to normal constitutional process.
               Under the powers delegated by these statutes, the President may: seize property; organize and control the means of production; seize commodities; assign military forces abroad; institute martial law; seize and control all transportation and communication; regulate the operation of private enterprise; restrict travel; and in a plethora of particular ways, control the lives of all American citizens.  The several States were seduced into the new policy in 1939, with Roosevelt's promise of federal grants-in-aid. 
               Federal Revenue Sharing (31 U.S.C. ( 6700 etseq.) is the modern version of the grants-in-aid program.  In return for these grants and later, other forms of “federal income”, the Governors of the several States agreed to uphold and maintain their completely unauthorized, illegal, and fraudulent pledge of the life, labor and property of their respective citizenry and the resources of their States as surety for the debt obligations of the Federal government.  The politicians of the respective states complied, because they viewed this as an opportunity to increase their own political power, and because in point of fact they are operating as municipal franchise corporations of the same Foreign government and its Agents, letting the next generation of office holders worry over the long term consequences of their acts and conveniently “forgetting” to enforce the contractual provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America owed the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska.
               All the oceans of the world could not contain these sins of omission made by the incorporated state governments. The so-called federal government has run rampant because the state governments which are supposed to be the watch dogs and defenders of the Petitioners and other Inhabitants of the (now 50) States have been devolved into municipal franchise corporations of the “United States of America” dba “US Corporation”.  They can still act to defend the Inhabitants of their States and they bear full fiduciary responsibility to do so, but for the most part, the corporations posing as proxies for the legitimate Republican form of government guaranteed by Article IV of The Constitution of the United States of America, shut up and put up like good little soldiers.
               The argument can be made that the corporate proxy State of Alaska, Inc., as a municipal franchise of the “United States of America” as defined as “….the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico….et alia” dba “US Corporation” cannot sue the parent organization, but that would be inconsistent with International Commercial Law or Law of International Admiralty, the only two venues that can be asserted in this instance.  Corporate subsidiaries of all kinds represent individual “persons” holding unique contracts and are perpetually found at Law asserting claims for and against their Franchise Sponsors, as neatly proven by any number of well-known court cases asserted by the State of Alaska against the “United States”.
               The Petitioners hold that enforcement of the provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America is not materially different than the State of Alaska’s responsibility to enforce other contracts.  The de facto “government” gave up its de jure status entirely in 1933, or rather, fraudulently dissolved it and instituted corporate structures to replace the de jure government, becoming equal in status to any other corporate entity on earth by becoming a “corporator”.   With respect to the Petitioners, the “United States of America” is a corporation under contract to provide services.  Likewise, the incorporated State governments are corporations under contract to provide services. 
               The separate Commonwealth nation also known as the “United States of America” defined as “….the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico…..et alia” is a foreign country with respect to the Petitioners, with all that that implies. 
               Please note that in setting aside the de jure government and replacing it with corporate structures the now 50 States United and the incorporated States no longer held any Sovereign power due to the bankruptcy fraudulently imposed upon the States.  A bankrupt entity cannot exercise Sovereignty.  Thus, by undermining the Sovereignty of the States in this manner, the “United States of America”  defined as the Several (now 50) Stated United also deprived itself of Sovereignty.
               Sovereignty resides in living Men and Women. It is an attribute of free will.  All Sovereignty resides in the Inhabitants of a country.  The Inhabitants delegate a portion of their Sovereignty to a State.  The State then delegates a portion of its borrowed Sovereignty to the national government.  By purporting to make both the citizens and the States subject to the bankruptcy in 1933, the treasonous Governors sought to undermine all Sovereignty inherent in the United States of America in any form, but as the Petitioners assert, the Governors acting in 1933 had no granted Authority or material interest justifying their “pledge” of our “full faith and credit” and as a result of that fraud, nothing can be alleged against our Sovereignty, our State, or our credit.  
               The Great Fraud practiced against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, does in no way destroy any element of valid contract owed them by the “United States of America” or its subsidiaries, nor does it Extinguish any of their own asserted Natural property Rights.  If anything, the overall conditions of fraudulent usurpation and material harm already done to the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska should lend wings to the feet of both the State of Alaska, Inc., Officials responsible for enforcement and demand equally prompt compliance from the “United States of America” and the Named Respondents.
               Petitioners note that these invalid claims against their persons and property interests were the result of collusion between both State Officials and Federal Officials, all busily and happily digging their unwashed hands into the Petitioners’ pocket under cover of darkness and non-disclosure. Implementing these measures via process of Executive Order allowed the Great Fraud to be administered largely outside the realm of public cognizance, and then the unlawful claim of “emergency” powers for the President consolidated it.
               All interested Parties are here and now duly Noticed that the Petitioners have invoked their Rights from under subrogation and that the Respondents and the Executive Officers of the State of Alaska are under Demand to Perform, just as they would be under International Law if they left any other contract derelict for years at a time, and exposed those to whom they owe fiduciary responsibility open to the frauds and rapacious demands of entities who are themselves DEBTORS with respect to the Petitioners, not Creditors, and certainly not Masters.  
               The blatant self-interest and Disservice to contract exhibited by the Respondents and their Predecessors in Office may be in part to gross ignorance; Petitioners grant that the Respondents may have been taken in by the Great Fraud just as well as anyone else, and they may think, due to decades of dereliction of duty in this regard on the part of the State of Alaska, Inc., that they owe no Due Diligence to the Constitution of the United States of America under contract----but in point of fact, they do.
                Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, cannot and do not entertain speculation regarding the intentions, personal motivations, or degree of understanding possessed by any of the Respondents named as parties to this Petition.  The Respondents are being addressed and given Notice as Office holders.  It is not “personal” and it is not necessary for us to establish any malicious intent on the part of the living entities holding Office. 
               Similarly, we do not entertain our charges against the State of Alaska Officials apart from their actions in Office once duly advised.  This is not about vengeance or getting even. Given the present level of debt these Respondents have engaged in through the misuse, abuse, and inflation caused by their fraudulent claims against the Honor and credit of the 50 States United and the Petitioners, no such end result may be hoped for.  What can be accomplished is a prompt settlement of these issues in favor of the Petitioners, summarily protecting the Petitioners from any further predations undertaken at the hands of the Respondents and their fellow undeclared Foreign Agents and an end to Miscarriage and Hemorrhage of Justice in Templum Regis.
               This is about the re-assertion of our Natural, Civil, and Human Rights, respectively, in the face of ongoing contract-infringing legislation enacted under conditions of fraud and extortion against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, and resulting in the abuse of the credit of the State of Alaska and also the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, created by the Great Fraud of 1933 and still ongoing.  This is about the  recognition of the Great Fraud itself practiced upon the 50 States United and their citizenry, and the resulting true nature and meaning of The Constitution of the United States of America as a public and commercial contract. The Petitioners, Natural-born Citizens of their Respective States, now inhabiting Alaska, are literally owed performance and due diligence that has not been in evidence for entire decades.
               The “consequences” have come home to this generation of State officials. The Foxes have been in charge of the hen house in self-evident fact, helping their Sponsors to pillage Petitioners by not enforcing the provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America and consenting with obsequious alacrity to all proposals allowing the Respondents to do any outrageous thing they wish to the Petitioners. Fortunately for the Petitioners (and as it turns out, the State of Alaska, too) there remains the thorny issue of the underlying Public Contracts to be enforced and the vitiating power of Fraud.
               The Petitioners maintain that the State Governors never possessed any such Authority to indebt them nor any valid claim over their private property, nor any vested Authority to commit the “full faith and credit” and thereby the substance of any of the Several (now) 50 States to pay the debts of any Foreign Corporation whatsoever.
               The actual and only existing valid contract between the “United States of America” defined as the 50 States United and the “United States of America” defined as the District of Columbia, et alia, is “The Constitution of the United States of America” together with its provisions and limitations, both in the services to be provided and the means of payment for those services, which are explicitly stated and whether interpreted as law, contract, or Public Policy, are clearly in evidence and must be accepted as contracts because no level of “government” represented either by the Respondents or the Governor of Alaska has recourse to Sovereignty over the 50 States United or the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, by any valid claim, and because by becoming incorporated entities they have no structure competent to function in anywise but under contract as made clear by Erie Railroad v. Thompkins.  
               To the extent that the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia…et alia” and the Respondents have overreached their Authority granted under contract, and abused the credit of the Petitioners and the 50 States United to do it, they are in the same position as an unscrupulous publisher of magazines, who uses the existence of one subscription as an excuse to present other magazines as if subscribed to, and then proposes that the recipients of his unsolicited products and services are under obligation to pay for them.
               No such provision of any kind, now or ever, has existed under any venue of Commercial Law, nor, if anyone should propose, the Law of International Admiralty. The just and universal result of such importunity is that the “magazine publisher” cannot demand payment for any goods or services that have not been knowingly, willingly, and under full disclosure provided under contract. Anything and everything that these Respondents have done in excess of the contract to which the 50 States United subscribed via their fraudulent claims against our credit must be emphatically denied by the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, and is so denied.
               Furthermore, Petitioners having mistakenly paid (or as in this case, having had their credit abused to do so) for goods or services they didn’t order, are entitled and required under International Law of Commerce to come forward and describe the fraud practiced against them and claim their innocence and restitution before any court of law having jurisdiction over the subject matter and ask for remedy.  The Petitioners and the 50 States United are equally defrauded by the “United States of America” as defined as “…the District of Columbia, et alia” dba “US Corporation”. 
               In all such cases and as universally recognized, those defrauded must be upheld.
               The State Citizens were not made aware of these actions in 1933, the consequences were never fully disclosed, and none of it was ever voted upon or approved by the State Citizens so impacted and purportedly “indebted”.  Similarly, the State Citizens were never made aware of any ability to present their own bills as Bills of Exchange under the Accepted for Value process as remedy for the gold resources confiscated in 1933, so that the remedy offered in exchange for the public liability created was as vacant of Honor as the Governors’ pledge of “good faith and credit” made against resources they didn’t own. 
               The original Trust Accounts established in repayment for the gold seizures were valued at $300,000 per person worth of debt repayment, and owing to the fact that two generations of Americans have lived and died without ever knowing they had recourse to any remedy, inflation and market conditions, these Trust Accounts are worth more than $7 million per person of guaranteed “debt repayment credit” or as it is sometimes explained, “guaranteed debt forgiveness” on paper now, amounting to the relatively small amount of $2.8 billion dollars, more or less,  that the US Corporation undoubtedly owes Americans on a per capita basis, but which in its unreasoning, endless greed refuses to pay except with the most pathetic snarling and ill-will toward the people it robbed and defrauded when they show up and present the IRS with a Bill of Exchange for payment.  
               Paying off this petty debt represents a drop in the bucket compared to all the other spending done by the Respondents via the fraudulent claims made against the Petitioners’ credit and the credit of their States and the gross amounts of taxation added in on top of it all as a pressure valve for the fiat money system.  Many Americans who are literally owed &#064; $7 million per person would have enjoyed keeping their homes, if they had only known (1) that the government absolutely does owe them this money and (2) they have also been the victims of mortgage fraud practiced against them on top of all the rest of the ills which accompanied the insinuation of “fractional reserve banking” into this country. 
               These Acts of the Governors and the Members of Congress and the President of the United States in March of 1933, were blatant, gross, and virulent frauds committed against our Progenitors inculcated via “emergency powers” they did not possess, and claims against property interests they equally did not possess.  As it was fraud then, it is fraud now.
               All these fraudulent acts of the “federal government” representing the self-interested Foreign Creditors, including these present infringing Acts of Congress known as the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, are by their nature null and void ab initio. Without the requisite material interest and granted Authority to Act, the pledge of the Governors was never due any implementation. 
                As an analogy, the Petitioners will willingly Quit Claim all their property interests in the Island of Majorca, but as they have no property interests in the Island of Majorca, the Quit Claim while a valid instrument has no legitimate effect.  In the same way, the Governors of a State may “pledge” their credit and their property interests in a State or in the credit of the State’s citizenry, but if they personally have no such valid property interest, the pledge is valid but vacant of any legitimate claim.
               In this case, the banks simply accepted the claim as if the Governors had a valid claim against the Several (now 50) States and the Citizens of the States and started collecting taxes on the Island of Majorca.
               On May 23, 1933, Congressman, Louis T. McFadden, brought formal charges against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank system, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Secretary of the United States Treasury for numerous criminal acts, including but not limited to, CONSPIRACY, FRAUD, UNLAWFUL CONVERSION, AND TREASON.  The petition for Articles of Impeachment was thereafter referred to the Judiciary Committee, and has yet to be acted upon.  (See: the Congressional Record, May 23, 1933, pp.  4055-4058.)
               This is prima facie evidence that the members of the Judiciary Committee have colluded to avoid correction and contractual compliance for almost 80 years.
               Like millions of others, Petitioners assumed that their government in the past was competent and honest and that whatever situation we now faced, we came to be here via a legitimate process.  Such is not the case. These mechanisms to date have served merely to cheat us, enslave us, and to extort our property interests from us under color of law. 
               We, the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, and each one of the several (now 50) States United have been the victims of a very high level, wide-ranging, and audacious Fraud promoted by the elected officials of both the State and Federal governments almost 80 years ago. Since then, we have continued to be the victims of Fraud, as these Foreign Creditors (banks) have under color of law and indiscriminately using “corporate proxies” to represent our legitimate government, have subtly infiltrated our institutions, taken over our Offices, and abused our credit to do so. 
               Unavoidably, though, these same “corporate governments” gave up Sovereignty and are not now “governments” with any de jure status.  They are corporations, albeit, very large and complex corporations, claiming before the world to operate under public contracts known as The Constitution of the United States of America and The Constitution(s) of the Several States.  What is claimed in Public must appear to be so and all that ought to have been done must appear to have been done; they have no recourse but to consent to the self-evident assertion: they are corporations by their own hand and under public contract. 
               Vast amounts of public and private property rightfully belonging to the 50 States United and the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, have been seized and controlled by this bankrupt foreign entity calling itself the “United States of America” and its continued importunate and non-contractual operation on American shores remains in violation of Public Law and International Edict. 
               The Governors of the 50 States responsible for the Great Fraud swore to uphold the several Republican States of the Union, and by their acts and vacant pledges of property and credit not their own, breached their Duty to protect the Citizens and their Posterity from fraud, imposition, avarice and stealthy encroachment.  (See: Atkins et al. vs. U.S., 556 F.2d 1028, pg. 1072, 1074, The Tempting Of America, supra, pgs. 155 - 159, also see, 5 U.S.C.A. 5305 &amp; 5335, Senate ReportNo. 93-549, pgs.  69 - 71, C.R.S. 24-75-101).
               It is the Governors who primarily acted in insurrection against the American government and who treasonously violated their Oath of Office by entering as Parties to the 1933 bankruptcy and pledging property they did not own in repayment of debts they did not owe.  By neglecting to enforce The Constitution of the United States of America and acquiescing to the fraudulent claims against our credit our Governors today are continuing the Great Fraud.
               The Respondents, Members of Congress, have performed their duty owed a Foreign Corporation.  As their actual Oath of Office proves, the Respondents have been more than loyal to the interests of the government they represent, howbeit, the long-standing subterfuge has  resulted in generations of Americans believing tacitly in the existence of a “dual allegiance” on the part of the Respondents, assuming that the Respondents were somehow “both” Americans and United States Citizens. That assumption is also proved wrong:
               ";... the United States is to be regarded as a body politic and corporate.  ... It is suggested that the United States is to be regarded as a domestic corporation, so far as the State of New York is concerned.  We think this contention has no support in reason or authority. ...  The United States is a foreign corporation in relation to a State.";  Merriam's Estate, 36 NE 505, 506 22.   See also: See United States v. Germane, 99 U.S. 508 (1879), Norton v. Shelby County, 118 U.S. 425, 441, 6 S.Ct. 1121 (1866), etc., dating to Pope v. Commissioner, 138 F.2d 1006, 1009 (6th Cir. 1943); where the state is concerned, the most recent corresponding decision was State v. Pinckney, 276 N.W.2d 433,436 (Iowa 1979).
            There is no provision for “dual citizenship” or any “dual allegiance”---See: Title 8 USC §§ 1101(a)(3), (21) and (22) and Public Law, 15 U.S. Stat., Chapter 249, pps 223-224.
            Far from being “representatives” of the Petitioners or their interests, the Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation, are in fact operating under Oath as undeclared Foreign Agents, representing a foreign government. Any assertion that the Respondents, Members of Congress, are elected officials representing one of the 50 States United and at the same time, are officers of a foreign government, the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, et alia”, is immediately disproven by both the Public Law cited above and the requirements of Federal Code, thus we have it from both sides of this fence:  the Respondents, Members of Congress, cannot be in “dual allegiance”.  They must either serve the 50 States United, a Protestant government built upon the Sovereignty of All Men, or they serve the “United States of America” defined as “the District of Columbia, et alia.” 
            To the extent that the Respondents, their Kith or their Kin, ever “served” the 50 States United, it has been merely under contract to provide enumerated services. From that Dishonored contract they have fruitfully endeavored to usurp the rightful government and harness the substance of the Continent and the Citizens thereof as slaves to their plow.   
               Such principles as ";Fraud and Justice never dwell together"; (Wingate's Maxims 680), and ";A right of action cannot arise out of fraud."; (Broom's maxims 297, 729; Cowper's Reports  343; 5 Scott's New Reports 558; 10  Mass.  276; 38 Fed. 800) are foundational truths in all human society, and would be so with or without our approbation. These basic principles are too high in thought and concept to be denied, as is ";Due Process";, ";Just Compensation"; and “Justice” itself. 
               The District of Columbia, Puerto Rico….et alia is equivalent to the “United States of America” in the same way that the color orange is in fact an apple.
               In 1938, the whole of America was bankrupted by design and by fraud.  The creditors, (foreign powers) seized ownership of the flag, State governments, their laws and constitutions, including every last comma and period, the whole country and its citizens.  These acts of fraud and treason placed Americans in peonage. 
               The 1937 Edition of the Book of the States openly declared that the people engaged in such activities as the Farming/Agro Related Industry had already been reduced to mere feudal ";Tenants"; on their Land, see the Book of The States, Book II, Volume II, 1937, p 155.  This is precisely the meaning of all “Deeds of Trust” presently offered by the “government” on all property naturally possessed by allodium----yet another devastating fraud practiced against the Americans. 
               Such icons as Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau presided over the Great Fraud and guided its implementation against the trusting American People.  For the next eight decades, they and their successors, have worked the Great Fraud with alacrity for their private benefit with the result that successive generations of Americans have been robbed of their material wealth, seen their monetary system destroyed and been held in bondage to ever-increasingly oppressive and more apparently illegal acts of legislation.
               Three generations of “government officials” have gone along with this “system” and have endeavored to keep it secret from the American people at the same time that they are suffering the outrages accumulated as a direct result of it.
               In 1940, Congress passed the ";Buck Act";, (4 U.S.C.S. Sections 105 113). In Section 110(e), the Act authorized any department of the federal government to create a ";Federal area"; for imposition of the ";Public Salary Tax Act"; of 1939, the direct progenitor of the Federal Income Tax.  This tax is imposed at 4 U.S.C.S. Sec. 111.  The Social Security Board had already created a ";Federal area"; overlay.
               A ";Federal area"; is any area designated by any agency, department, or establishment of the federal government. This includes the Social Security areas designated by the Social Security Administration, any public housing area that has federal funding, a road that has federal funding, and almost everything that the federal government touches through any type of aid. (See Springfield v. Kenny, 104 N.E. 2d 65 (1951 App.))
               A presumed ";Federal area"; purportedly attaches to anyone who has a Social Security Number, harkening back to the Hooven and Allison Company v. Evatt decision, and giving rise to several more kinds of governmental fraud.  
               Like millions of others, the Petitioners were lied to by undeclared Foreign Agents of the “federal government” and told that they “had to” sign up for a Social Security Number as a “condition of employment” not related in any way to the federal government.  They were coerced, also, to sign “Birth Certificates” for their children----another act of extortion and fraud practiced against them.  These documents and associations were all coerced under color of law and used to create a “presumption” that the Petitioners are “US citizens” and therefore subjects of Congress.
               Once enrolled in Social Security, the Buck Act comes into play, with the result that millions of Americans are literally enslaved, their value bought, sold, and traded on mercantile exchanges as “securities” underlying the National Debt.
               This is all the result of another widespread species of governmental fraud---fraud by presumption.  Nobody ever told these Americans that they weren’t really “required” to sign up for Social Security, and nobody bothered to explain what the consequences of that contract would be.  They didn’t sign the dotted line “knowingly, willingly, and under conditions of full disclosure”. They have uniformly and universally been extorted, coerced, defrauded and railroaded every step of the way.  
               Through this mechanism, the so-called federal government, a recognized Foreign government, has endeavored to usurp the Sovereignty of the People, as well as the Sovereignty of the several States, by creating ";Federal areas"; within the boundaries of the states under the purported authority of Article 4, Section3, Clause 2 (4:3:2) in the Constitution of the United States of America.
               According to this base argument, all U.S. citizens [properly, citizens of the District of Columbia et alia, Negroes, and federal government employees] residing in one of the states of the Union, are classified as ";property";, literally franchisees of the federal government, and as an ";individual entity";.  (See Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Fox, 298 U.S. 193, 80 L.Ed. 1143, 56 S.Ct.  773.  The Buck Act, undertaken by Congress in its capacity as the Rulers of the District of Columbia, et alia, renders all “US citizens” de facto slaves.  
               This very material advantage of being able to classify “US citizens” as “property” and to buy, sell, and trade them on the world’s securities exchanges has been very profitable and convenient, and has led to numerous extortion gambits (such as not letting parents of new babies leave the hospital without signing “Birth Certificates”) and coercion (such as telling young people that they “must” sign up for Social Security as a condition of having a job) so as to generate presumptive claims against their victims and “documentary evidence” that the government owns them and that they are “US citizens”, i.e, slaves owned by the federal government.  
               In 1980, President Jimmy Carter transferred all American Birth Certificates to the IMF.  Based on the treachery and fraud committed in 1933 by a handful of Governors, and further acts of fraud and usurpation the so-called “US government” has continued to buy, sell, and trade the “value” of American Citizens improperly claimed to be “US citizens” together with their property.  This fraudulent claim of “ownership” is also the basis for the federal government’s claim to enforce Selective Service requirements on our sons and daughters. 
               Petitioners admit that this fraud committed against Americans by these monsters in suits is apt to cause disbelief and a rising gorge, but we know its complete historical development, from concept to completion, and can cite both chapter and verse.  The portion of this that is important to the matter at hand is that the Respondents, Foreign Agents, have looked upon Americans as their “livestock” for a long time. 
               Armed with their original claims based on fraud committed back in the 1930’s, and a stack of “documentation”---Birth Certificates, Marriage Licenses, Drivers License, Social Security Numbers, Tax Identification Numbers,  and so on----they have found it easy to assert their silent claims against Americans in venues of International Law, using mere legal presumption to convict them, abuse them, steal their money, create liens against their property, send them to war, and continue their vile predations unchallenged.  They are no doubt amazed to read these words and grasp their import, as it must seem that the horses are suddenly talking back to them after 80 years of silence.         
               Under the ";Buck Act";, (4 U.S.C.S. Sections 105-113), the federal government has created ";Federal areas"; where they exercise their despotic “territorial law”.  This is evidenced by the Executive Branch's yellow fringed U.S. flag displayed in schools and most courtrooms.
               In 1966, Congress being severely compromised, passed the ";Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, by which the entire taxing and monetary system i.e.  ";Essential Engine"; (See: Federalist Papers No. 31) was placed under the Uniform Commercial Code. (See:     Public Law 89-719, Legislative History, pg. 3722, also see C.R.S. 5-1- 106).
               The Uniform Commercial Code was, of course, promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in collusion with the American Law Institute for the ";banking and business interests."; (See: Handbook of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, (1966) Ed. pgs. 152 &amp; 153).
               Things steadily grew worse and on March 28, 1970, President Richard Nixon issued Proclamation No. 3972, declaring (again) an ";emergency"; because the Postal Employees struck against the de facto government for higher pay, due to inflation of the paper ";Bills of Credit."; aka “Federal Reserve Notes”. (See: Senate Report No. 93-549, pg.  596)  Nixon placed the U.S. Postal Department under the control of the ";Department of Defense."; (See: Department Of The Army Field Manual, FM 41-10 (1969)). 
               The constantly contrived ";emergencies"; which have been used as the excuse for tyranny, robbery, gross fraud, and political usurpation of our rightful government, have created numerous abuses and usurpations, and abridgements of delegated Powers and Authority as stated in Senate Report 93-549 merely the most recent examples of which are represented by The Patriot Act, NDAA 2012, and the proposed Enemy Expatriation Act.
               The statements heard in the Federal and State Tribunals, on numerous occasions, to the effect that Constitutional arguments are ";immaterial";, ";frivolous"; etc., are based upon concealment of the fraud being practiced against Americans and the equally well-concealed existence of the contractual duties owed to them. 
               Diligent scholars have long realized that in the 18th century the word “federal” was a synonym for “contract” and that the “federal government” is a “contract government” and not as is often assumed, a “federation” of states.  That this is true can be easily derived from the necessity of imposing direct per capita taxation in a federation of states, and the fact that no such per capita direct tax has ever been imposed.  The fact that the Constitution is a Contract and that the “debt” implied by the word “Constitution” is the debt incurred by the States to pay for specific services secured under contract is further obscured by describing those services as enumerated “Powers”. 
               In the 18th century, “powers” implied the basis of taking action, as in “empowerment”.  The Constitution agreement empowered, as in allowed, the federal government under contract to provide certain common services for all the States.
               The Petitioners offer this analogy--- 13 members of a condo association (associated under the Articles of Confederation) got together over beer and pretzels in Philadelphia and decided to create a new company (the federal government) to provide snow removal, lawn care, security, and several other named services (enumerated Powers)  in behalf of the condo owners (States). They called their written contract setting up the new service company “the Constitution” and agreed to pay dues (taxes) to the new company in exchange for these services.  At the same time, some members got nervous and wanted to make it clear what “services” and actions were NOT to be undertaken by the new company (government) and so they added stipulations clearly stating that the new company would NOT be allowed to block anyone’s driveway, or show partiality about emptying dumpsters, or clean the swimming pool (the Bill of Rights) and for a time, things went on very well. 
               More members joined the condo association and paid their dues and everyone prospered, but then, new management took over the company providing services under contract, and these people were determined to extort more money and exercise far more power than their predecessors.  They became predatory toward the original condo association and used their profits to set up their own condo association, which they named after the original one.  This allowed them to charge off the costs associated with their new private condo association and its separate service company (government) against the original condo association.  After all, they had the same name.  Who is to know?  Time went on, and the management of the service company got greedier and greedier.  They bought off or intimidated everyone to the point where they claimed to own or control nearly everything, and they blatantly ignored the requirements of their original contract. 
               Some of the condo owners finally stood up and said----“Wait a minute! ---- and then everyone living in the condos requested a Writ of Habeas Corpus to defend against a Bill of Detainer set forth against them by the service company.
               At this point, the service company is fraudulently claiming to own the original condos, the condo association, and everyone and everything living in and associated with the original condos. Via fraud and antagonistic unlawful “legislation” they are willing to kill, imprison, indefinitely detain, defame, and dishonor anyone who stands in their way. 
               The Respondents are clearly, unequivocally, and demonstrably engaged in criminal acts against the 50 States United and the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska. Not only are they infringing against their public contract, The Constitution of the United States of America, the only valid contract existing between them and the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, they are operating the American government, including the “State of Alaska” under False Flag as undeclared Foreign Agents under color of law and conditions of gross fraud.
               The Great Fraud and the resulting contrived ";emergency"; situations that have been created to justify the continuance of “emergency powers” for these formally ";Expatriated"; Foreign Agents---Presidents, Members of Congress, Secretary of the Treasury, et alia.  None of these people are American Citizens by definition --- and they have been operating illegally in this country and derogating the legitimate government and the rights of the American populace for nearly eighty years.  (See: Letter, Insight Magazine, February 18, 1991, pg.  7, Lowell L. Flanders, President, U.N. Staff Union, New York) 8 U.S.C.A.  1481 is one of the controlling statutes on expatriation as is 22 U.S.C.A.  611 - 613 and 50 U.S.C.A. 781.
               This entire scenario is in textbook compliance with ";Silent Weapons For Quiet Wars";, Research Technical Manual TM-SW7905.1, which discloses a Declaration of War upon the American people.  (See: pg. 3 &amp; 7).
                The Internal Revenue Service entered into a ";service agreement"; with the U.S. Treasury Department (See: Public Law 94-564, Legislative History, pg. 5987, Reorganization Plan No. 26) and the Agency for International Development, pursuant to Treasury Delegation Order No.  91.  It is a foreign entity based out of Puerto Rico, working for the “Secretary of the Treasury” of Puerto Rico, who acts in behalf of the Foreign Creditors (banks) as the Trustee of the fraudulently imposed “bankruptcy”. 
               The Agency For International Development is an International paramilitary operation (See: Department of the Army Field Manual, (1969) FM 41-10, pgs. 1-4, Sec. 1-7(b) &amp; 1-6, Section 1- -10(7)(c)(1), 22 U.S.C.A. 284), and it includes such activities as ";Assumption of full or partial executive, legislative, and judicial authority over a  country or area."; (See: FM 41-10, pg.  1-7, Section 110(7)(c)(4)) also see, Agreement Between The United Nations And The United States Of America Regarding The Headquarters Of The United Nations, Section7(d) &amp; (8), 22 U.S.C.A.  287 (1979 Ed.) at pg. 241). It is to be further observed that the ";Agreement"; regarding the Headquarters District of the United Nations was NOT agreed to (See: Congressional Record - Senate, December 13, 1967, Mr. Thurmond).
               The United Nations Headquarters is illegally situated in this country and officially unwelcome on American soil.
               The 1985 Edition of the Department Of Army Field Manual, FM 4110 further describes its International ";Civil Affairs"; operations.  At page 3-6 it is admitted that the Agency for International Development is autonomous and under direction of the International Development Cooperation Agency, and at page 3-8, that the operation is ";paramilitary.";  The International Organization(s) intents and purposes was to promote, implement and enforce a ";DICTATORSHIP OVER FINANCE IN THE UNITED STATES."; (See: Senate Report No. 93-549, pg. 186)
               There can be no doubt that they have thus far succeeded in their aims, and that those aims are completely predatory, criminal, and in non-compliance with their contract in respect to the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, and Americans in general.
               It appears from the documentary evidence that the Internal Revenue Service Agents etc., are ";Agents of a Foreign Principal"; within the meaning and intent of the ";Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938."; They are directed and controlled by the corporate ";Governor"; of The Fund"; a/k/a ";Secretary of Treasury"; (See: Public Law 94-564, supra, pg. 5942, U.S. Government Manual 1990/91, pgs. 480 &amp; 481, 26 U.S.C.A.  7701(a)(11), Treasury Delegation Order No. 150-10), and the corporate ";Governor"; of ";The Bank"; 22 U.S.C.A. 286 &amp; 286a, acting as ";information service employees 22 U.S.C.A. 611(c)(ii).
               They have been and do now ";solicit, collect, disburse or dispense contribution (Tax - pecuniary contribution, Black's Law Dict. 5th ed.), loans, money or other things of value for or in interest of such foreign principal 22 U.S.C.A.  611(c)(iii), and they entered into agreements with a Foreign Principal pursuant to Treasury Delegation Order No. 91 i.e. the ";Agency For International Development."; (See: 22 U.S.C.A. 611(c)(2))
               Among other reasons for lack of authority to act, such as lack of a Foreign Agents Registration Statement, 22 U.S.C.A. 612 and 18 U.S.C.A. 219 &amp; 951, military authority cannot be imposed into civil affairs.  (See: Department of The Army Pamphlet 27100- 70, Military Law Review, Vol. 70), though the recent overthrow of Posse Comitatus restrictions may also expedite that “legalization”. 
               This unelected, unrepresentative, unaccountable oligarchy, fraudulently claims that they “represent” us and that their intent and purpose is to establish ";rational and equitable international economic relations";, yet as documented and also voiced by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and his successor Ben Bernanke, they no longer ";stabilize the value of the dollar"; nor ";assure the value of the coin and currency of the United States";. Their own statements belie the misrepresentations, deceits, and frauds that have allowed their existence in this country at all. (See: Public Law 95-147, 91 Stat. 1227, at pg. 1229)
               This was augmented by Public Law 101-167, 103 Stat.  1195, which discloses massive appropriations of re-hypothecated debt credit for the general welfare and common defense of  other Foreign Powers, including Communist countries.
               The International control of natural and human resources in America is clearly established in the Public Record.  A ";resource"; is a claim of ";property"; and when related to people it constitutes ";slavery.";  There is no better proof of America’s slavery than the constant overbearing propaganda telling us that we are “free” and that we live in the “land of the free” when it is self-evident truth that we are living in peonage brought about by fraud, continued by deceit, and enforced by ignorance.
               The Respondents, who tacitly believe that they own us, see no reason to respect us even to the extent of not expecting us to enforce commercial contracts.  Private ownership of slaves was abolished and outlawed by Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America in 1868, far antecedent to the Great Fraud perpetuated in 1933.  What is true of the example is true of the class, and yet, because Americans haven’t until now understood how they got into this situation and have been unable to answer the silent claims being asserted against them by legal presumption, public sector slave ownership is alive and well in America in the year 2012.
               The clear evidence is all around us.  We live with it every day. Our patience and tolerance for those who pervert the very necessary and basic foundations of society have been pushed to insufferable levels.  They have ";fundamentally"; changed the form and substance  of the de jure Republican form of Government guaranteed to each State under Article 4, Sec. 4 of the Constitution of the United State of America, exhibited  a willful and wanton disregard for the Rights, Safety and Property of others, evinced a despotic design to reduce the people to slavery, peonage and involuntary servitude, under a fraudulent, tyrannical, seditious foreign oligarchy, with intent and purpose to institute, erect and form a dictatorship over all Citizens and their Posterity.  The federal government of the “United States of America” as defined as “the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, et alia…” is a functional representation of the word “criminal”. 
               They have insinuated their Foreign Agents, Confederations, and Alliances, all under pretense of ";emergencies";, virtually all of which for the past 80 years, they themselves created, promoted, and furthered. They have formed a multitude of offices for themselves at public expense, and retained others of alien allegiance to perpetuate their frauds and to eat out the substance of the Petitioners.
               They have trespassed on our Lives, Laws, Liberties, Properties and Families and have intolerably endangered our Peace, Safety, Welfare and Dignity. 
               As Ambrose Bierce observed, “To steal were folly, for ‘tis plain, in cheating there is greater gain.” The perpetrators of this scheme have certainly profited more and longer by fraud and usurpation than would have ever been endured by outright theft. 
                In the field of law we have suffered removal of federal common law with the Erie Railroad Co. v Tompkins case, 304 US 64; and the hodge-podging of the jurisdictions of Law and Equity together, which is known as ";One Form of Action";; as two of the main insanities dictated by the supposed new “owners” of America.  
               Sometime between 1958 and 1970 the Law of Admiralty was mixed in with the One Form of Action civil actions, creating an even more insane mixture of venues and jurisdictions  (See Rule 1 in the 1958 and 1970 Editions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in Title 28, United States Code.) leading to endless iterations of different forms of law within the same courts and even within individual suits, all the more convenient when using the law as a weapon to skewer the ignorant and unwary. Only a very astute attorney or a very dogged student of law persistently badgering the judge to declare jurisdiction with every change of wind can keep up with the madness involved.
               In Federalist Paper No. 83 Hamilton expressed, ";My convictions are equally strong that great advantages result from the separation of the equity and the law jurisdiction ...";  The Constitution establishes the three jurisdictions as separate in Article III, but once again, the aim of the Foreign government domiciled in the District of Columbia  is to ignore and disrespect the obvious provisions of their contract, and they have relied on the complicity of the States and the BAR Association, never dreaming that any of the long-robbed, chained, and beaten Americans would invoke their subrogated rights under International Law.
               There is no Constitutional authority for operating in bankruptcy under Martial Law or Foreign Rule.  The legislative, executive, and judicial branches no longer exist, as the de jure government has fraudulently been dissolved and the entire country has been received in bankruptcy by the Fund (IMF) and World Bank through a series of equally fraudulent ";emergency war powers"; acts.
               HOWEVER, the public commercial contracts are still in existence, and still in effect under International Law of Commerce and Admiralty.  The usurpers couldn’t quite figure out a way of profiting from their new kingdom without trade and commerce, and they couldn’t quite dare to remove the pretense of having lawful granted Authority to Act, so they translated the de jure document, “The Constitution of the united States of America” into the public contract known as The Constitution of the United States of America. That contract and its enforcement by the State Officials responsible for its enforcement is our due remedy and cure. 
               The objective of the original bankruptcy was not to resolve any ";emergency";; it was to create an emergency for the express purpose of changing the governmental, social, economic and industrial character of the de jure society, to infringe and abrogate and derogate unalienable Rights, steal and alienate the Birth Rights of the Americans, impair the obligations of honest contracts, to defraud and to obtain a benefit from that fraud, to create turbulence and contention in the world to allow more war profiteering, to overthrow the legitimate American government, and to establish in its stead a corrupt totalitarian oligarchy in direct contravention to the Law of the Land, and against the Peace, Dignity and Security of the Inhabitants of America.
               Because the States also are now technically bankrupt entities not even the (de facto) incorporated State courts have any sovereignty and no strictly enforceable jurisdiction, and can only invite participants into court.   State courts are now only courts of mediation, just as District courts are merely courts of “special jurisdiction” established by Treaty.  Thus it is that the Petitioners acting as Sovereigns must bid the natural jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska into being, because it no longer exists otherwise. 
                Fines collected by State courts go to the Federal Reserve Banks, the depository agents for the Fund and the Bank.  Thus, administrative agents in this State are also acting as trustees and agents for foreign principals, and are required to register as such.
               Guilt or innocence of Americans is being bought and sold and speculated upon, as securities markets based on the Alaska Court System (and every other State Court System) are now freely traded on the stock market, together with a “derivatives” market that trades up or down depending on the number of misdemeanor and felony suits on the docket.  More felony cases equates to more “value” for the court.  More felony convictions mean even more “asset gain” for the court and its investors.  It is little wonder that we now have more than six million Americans in prison, and more than 800 FEMA Camps established nationwide, waiting to receive more “criminals” and “terrorists”.
               The same criminals who have worked this fraud for three generations make money off all the slave labor they can coerce from the prison populations, and they can force the hapless “taxpayers” to pay the cost of supporting this prison industry, making it doubly profitable for the perpetrators.  Thus it is that America with only 5% of the world’s population holds 25% of all the prisoners incarcerated worldwide, as recently and extensively documented by the American Civil Liberties Union.
            Every American can see the writing on this wall.  For the legal profession continuing business as usual means betrayal of the Law and of Justice, and a world in which attorneys and judges are reduced to being servants of the most venal commercialization of crime. Not only that, the long complicity of American attorneys usurped by the BAR Association has resulted in a palpable and growing hatred for the legal profession as a whole, because it has not established justice and has instead allowed itself to be co-opted and used as a foreign  instrumentality to enforce oppression and institutionalize fraud.
            It is by far not only for themselves that the Petitioners now act and call upon the Justices of The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc. to act in their favor.  
            As the enormity of the fraud practiced upon the Americans comes home to them and as the details are spread far and wide throughout the world community as has already been done and is, obviously, being done, the perpetrators will be justifiably afraid of the consequences of their actions and will try by various means to secure public support for their persecution of the victims. 
            They will also try to deny guilt, complicity, and even plain and self-evident truth.  Those Americans who oppose this fraud and usurpation by Foreign Agents will be trumped up as the Boogey Man, as “kooks” and violent “homegrown terrorists” bent on “destroying the legitimate government” when in fact, they are merely asserting their guaranteed rights under contract, making just claims against fraud, and seeking to restore an American government to America. 
               If ";public officials";, Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation, represent anyone under the Constitution of the United States of America, they can only collect, use, and be paid in Constitutional money, gold and silver or certificates representing the same. They can only operate at common law in all criminal matters except for Maritime contracts. That is the plain and simple requirement of our public contract, which has so long been left unenforced.  They cannot wantonly exercise the credit of the 50 States or the Inhabitants thereof; they are limited to expenses related to the services they are tasked to provide by The Constitution of the United States of America.  They cannot pass legislation like the Buck Act, summarily reducing Americans to the status of slaves.  They cannot lawfully enact any legislation such as the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012) against Americans, either.
               Contrast those contractual requirements with our current situation. 
               Federal Reserve Banks are private banks.  They are and they have always as “federal” as Federal Express. The Justices of The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc. will not find them listed among any governmental agencies.  In the same tradition of semantic swindles that gave us three different common meanings of “United States of America”, the gullible public was led to believe that the “Federal Reserve” was a public agency.
               The “Federal Reserve Notes” issued by the Federal Reserve banks are self-evidently a private script, not “US Dollars” at all.  If one closely reads Title 26, Chapter A, Subchapter N, Section 1-1861, “effectively connected income”, (iv) concerning banking, one lands in Title 12 of the Federal Code.  There we learn that because we have a Social Security Number (which we were falsely told was a mandatory condition of employment) and because we unknowingly and without our agreement, become “bankers” when we authorize those “Bills of Exchange” known as checks, we are considered ---among other things----a “US citizen” and automatically enrolled as a member of the National Banking Association. 
               We are informed that for the “privilege” of using the banking services of the Federal Reserve banks and their private script, we are obligated to pay the Federal Income Tax. This “presumed” obligation is represented by three words, “effectively connected income” in the entire Internal Revenue Code and the microprint embedded in the signature line of every bank check.  More fraud, in other words, based on misrepresentations, coercion, extortion, undisclosed contractual obligations, and then, exercised by mammoth amounts of legal presumption and buried in literally tons— 101,123 pages --- of purposefully evasive and obtuse legal gobbledygook posing as reasonable and valid regulation.
               If ";public officials";, Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation,  use Federal Reserve ";Notes,"; (technically, these pieces of paper don’t meet the legal definition of a “Note” because they don’t purport to deliver anything to anyone on presentment, and are actually “Bills of Exchange”) or funds reducible only to Federal Reserve ";Notes"; in public business, they are using non-redeemable,  dishonored, impaired, depreciated, re-hypothecated, interagency, international bills of debt/credit akin to a place-holder or casino chip, and by definition, they are operating a de facto government, which is treason against The Constitution of the United States of America and the Offices they pretend to hold as representatives of the 50 States United, and by subrogation, a gross violation of the duty owed to the Petitioners and the 50 States United under contract.
                ";A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong  gives it a superficial appearance of being right,"; said  Thomas Paine, and indeed, such obvious and readily available observations as these are before our eyes every hour of every day, and still, for almost eighty years, the Americans have slept on and listened to the propaganda, stoically bearing their unjust burdens, sending their sons and daughters off to wars that benefit profiteers, believing every lie told to them by “their” government, pathetically cherishing their flags and their national memorials, and all the while, they rise up and lie down as slaves “in the Land of the Free”. 
               The law, especially The Constitution of the United States of America, if properly exercised, serves to expose the ongoing corruption by forcing these Foreign Agents, the Respondents, into the light of day, and hauling their corporate masters, the Foreign Creditors, out of the shadows, but you will note that the most avid proponent of “corporate responsibility” in America, the former US Attorney General, Robert Fitzgerald Kennedy, was gunned down by an assassin, and so was his brother, President John F. Kennedy.
            Kennedy was the last American President.  He was killed within a few months of issuing Executive Order 11110 to issue real American currency to compete with “Federal Reserve Notes”.  One of Lyndon B. Johnson’s first acts as President was to rescind that Order.  We have not had a viable American currency since. 
            This fact should be noted as relevant to the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, as it clearly indicates the violent nature of those who are reaping benefits from the destruction of America, and underscores the severity of the threat the Petitioners are under from those who offered the Bills of Detainer in the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012) and now, the incipient Enemy Expatriation Act.
               Failure to file the ";Foreign Agents Registrations Statement"; with the courts goes directly to the heart of the Fraud being practiced and the usurpation of jurisdiction that has resulted.  Virtually all attorneys in America dealing with “federal” cases lack standing to be before the court. It is a felony pursuant to 18 USC 219, &amp; 951 for them or their corporate masters, such as the Respondents, Members of Congress, to appear without their Foreign Agents Registration and Corporate Charter in hand.  They may not even address the Court without a named and duly delegated non-attorney corporate representative in place, and yet they do so every day.
               The conflict of law, interest, and allegiance is obvious. 
               While representing a Foreign government to which they have sworn their Public Oath, the Respondents pretend to be representing the 50 States United and by subrogation, the Petitioners.  Attorneys representing a foreign government are passing themselves off as “US Attorneys” purportedly representing the legitimate granted Authority of the Petitioners, and conveniently misrepresenting their status, allegiances, and actions. 
               ";NO MAN CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS."; See See the Gospel of Luke 16:13, Jeffery v Pounds, 67 Cal.App.3d 6,  Cinema 5 v Cinerama 528 F 2d 1384, Easly v Brookline Trust 256 SW 2d  983.
               In US v Woodly 726 F 2d 1328 and 751 F 2d 1008, it is ruled that a judge who can be influenced by another Department or others, is not an Article III de jure judge.  And in US v Ferreira 13, How, 42 it is ruled that a judge who can be influenced by another (not independent), is only a commissioner under a treaty.
               As another example, an enabling treaty must be produced and in evidence and made available every time a Statutory Court is in session, along with the Foreign Agents Registrations of every judge, attorney, or corporate representative of the “United States of America” as defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico….et alia” without exception to be in compliance, yet every day, these courts operate under conditions of lawless anonymity, passing themselves off as “American” and the attorneys go on practicing before these courts without standing, such that “my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.”
               The US Tax Court goes so far as to openly display the Papal Axe on a shield on its publications, and openly encourages and solicits the victims to provide them with a “Petition” which then grants the statutory court automatic jurisdiction and the ability to dispose with these innocent people in whatever manner they desire.  The criminality of this entire process and system supporting it is apparent. 
               If the Officers of the State of Alaska and the Offices occupied by The Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, Inc. wish to continue their role as servants to this crime syndicate and continue to join in the perpetration and administration of this abject criminality, they must do so under conditions of Dishonor and as open outlaws and criminals themselves.
               There is no authority under the Constitution of the United States of America for Statutory Administrative courts, and yet they have been proliferating along with the fashionable trend toward imprisoning everyone, and they have been allowed to continue functioning under color of law without the slightest oversight regarding their operations and declarations and documentation required of these courts and those who practice in them.  We have Tax Courts, Bankruptcy Courts, Traffic Courts, Family Courts, and if we are honest, Court Courts, howbeit, we call them Judicial Councils.  Most Americans take it for granted that these are “their” courts, when in fact, they serve the interests of an undeclared foreign government and the Foreign Creditors who control that government.  
               ";We (Courts) have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given.  The one or the other would be treason to the Constitution.";  (Emphasis added) Cohen v Virginia 6 Wheat 264. 
               That treason has occurred and is occurring.
               Statutory courts have been allowed to usurp authority and jurisdiction, to punish and brand Americans in every respect, requiring “licenses” for the exercise of basic rights, such as the right to travel, sitting in judgment of personal relationships in “Family Courts”, and rapaciously exacting “tribute” in the form of unlawful taxation of those not rationally subject to the “Federal Income Tax”-----all these evils and more have been allowed under conditions of fraud, presumption, and most especially, lack of enforcement of contractual obligations.
               ";In all Cases ... in which a State shall be a Party ... the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction ..."; Article 3,  Section 2, U.S. Constitution.
               Judges who pretend judicial power without really having it, and when they act for  foreign principals, violate 18 USC  219 and 951.  These are major crimes, flourishing like dandelions in spring throughout the judicial system.
               All such acts of fraud, deceit, and usurpation committed against the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, and their Progenitors, in contradiction to the clear contractual requirements of The Constitution of the United States of America, are acts of treason committed by undeclared Foreign Agents and public officials acting outside their granted Authority.
               Security for debt can never be lawfully obtained by fraud, and no conceivable debt or circumstance may be promoted as an “emergency” to excuse such venal, self-interested, purposeful deceit and intolerable presumption.
               Fraud vitiates everything that comes after. The Petitioners, along with every other American, have been vilely defrauded of their property, including their Natural, Civil, and as the case may be, Human Rights.
               ";Fraud vitiates the most solemn contracts, documents, and even judgments."; U.S. v Throckmorton, 98 US 426. 
               Fraud vitiates pledges made against credit, and by corollary, against the substance of property. It ends the slavery of Americans falsely classified as “US citizens”. It renders the Statutory Court System impotent.  Fraud renders 78 years worth of contract-infringing provisions embedded in “emergency” legislation, all illegal Executive Orders, and all related oppressive Public Policy imposed upon the 50 States United invalidated. It also ends any non-contractual claim not evident in The Constitution of the United States of America against the land and material resources of the 50 States United. It also invalidates the current offending legislation, the Patriot Act and the NDAA (2012). It re-establishes our Sovereignty. 
               The Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation, have sworn their Oath of Allegiance to a foreign government known as the “United States of America” as defined as “the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, et alia.” As Public Law and Federal Code have demonstrated, they cannot have two such allegiances, and indeed, upon reflection, it is apparent that these Foreign Agents have only one allegiance and it is to that “other” United States.  By their own acts they have repeatedly promoted the continuance of gross constructive fraud against Americans, depriving the Petitioners of their property, their security, and any semblance of performance under contract, constantly infringing and seeking to infringe the guaranteed rights of the Petitioners, and uniformly failing to declare their status as Foreign Agents.
               The foreign government these Respondents represent routinely engages in activities forbidden to the de jure State and acts in collusion with International interests pursuant to 
26 IRC 6103(k)(5) under the pretense of the ";Intergovernmental Personnel Act";, acting as the ";FedState Team."; The FedState Team is under the direction and control of the Assistant Commissioner (INTERNATIONAL).  See Internal Revenue Manual Section 1132.61 Pages 1100-40.1 through 1100-40.2 (1992 Edition) and FedState Bulletins -Commissioner's Advisory Group Meeting September 24 &amp; 25 Minutes. 
               The State government is supposed to protect State Citizens from excesses by federal government personnel, and likewise the federal government is supposed to protect the Petitioners from excesses by State government personnel.  Protection of the Inhabitants and their property rights is the only reason the Petitioners and their Progenitors ever created a government, as plainly stated in the Preamble of the Constitution of the United States of America and the Declaration of Independence.
               Unfortunately, the aim of the government truly represented by the Respondents, Members of Congress, is excess and subjugation, so this ";FedState Team"; has established “cooperation” between all government personnel working not for the people, but for foreign principals, seeking to break the natural allegiance of local government to local people.  We have seen the results in the use of National Guard troops in foreign lands, the destruction of the State Militia and its leadership being commandeered by National Guard officers, the end of Posse Comitatus rules, allowing and promoting the use of our own troops, our own flesh and blood, equipped and trained with our tax money, against us and in defense of this criminal, usurping, foreign government.
               The undeclared operation of all Statutory Courts in America, the presence of no less than 63 armed agencies of the “federal government”, the continuing wild predation of the American monetary system, the building and provisioning of more than 800 FEMA internment camps, continued out of control spending, the war-mongering, the lock down of resources and industrial development, and non-stop action by the Respondents, Members of Congress, to pass legislation in blatant contradiction to The Constitution of the United States of America, including the Patriot Act and NDAA (2012), are all readily observable and clear indications that the perpetrators of this immense Fraud against the American People are not only very real, they are running scared and preparing to victimize the victims some more.
               If we let them. 
               Should public officials of the State of Alaska continue to aid and abet these acts of fraud and propose to continue this system of de facto government unopposed, and refuse to provide protection of their Office to the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, in all respects they will be acting as trustees for foreign principals, as defined in 22 USC 611, namely The Fund (IMF), and The Bank. As such they will be required to file a Foreign Agents Registration Statement form and supplements thereto, pursuant to 22 USC 612, and are not exempt pursuant to 22 USC 613, see Rabinowitz v Robert Kennedy 376 US 605.  They will also lose recourse to any pretension to possess the granted Authority to Act in behalf of the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, and will be pursued and prosecuted at Law on an International basis.  As “US citizens” they may also find themselves prosecuted under Title 18, Section 241: TITLE 18--U.S.C. Sec. 241, quote:                “If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same; ---- They shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include kidnapping or an  attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, they shall be fined  under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.”
               Please note that the “Constitution of the United States” mentioned here is the same document mentioned in the Respondent’s Oath of Office.  It is not the “Constitution of the United States of America”.  The same semantic shell games are played throughout.
               By continuing in ignorance or on purpose to administer this perfidy, ";public officials"; at all levels are committing treason against The Constitution of the United States of America. When confronted with these facts, they must take their stand, either to assist and protect the victims and to enforce the contractual provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America, or, to come out of the closet and openly declare that they are Foreign Agents acting without granted Authority.
               ";There is no position which depends on clearer principle than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid.  To deny this would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above the master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid."; -- Federalist Paper No. 78, Alexander Hamilton
               We have indeed come to the pass Alexander Hamilton so eloquently described. Those entrusted with our government have fallen by fraud, by self-interest, by ignorance, by cowardice, by lack of moral virtue, by every weakness and insidious corruption known to fallible Man and Woman, and it is left to the rest of us to do something to save ourselves and our beloved country.
            The Respondents, Members of Congress, Officers of the US Corporation, have so far breached their contractual obligations as to claim authorities that are specifically forbidden to them  by approving indefinite detainment without recourse to Due Process in contradiction to the provisions of the 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, &amp; 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America.  The circumstance should speak for itself, but taken in the context of the history leading up to this moment, it takes on a more urgent, larger, and more somber importance. 
            This is far from the first time that the provisions of The Constitution of the United States of America have been disrespected by the Respondents, Members of Congress.  Americans have been living under a false “state of emergency” and under a fraudulent bankruptcy for eight decades and have suffered innumerable infringements against their laws, lives, liberty, and property since then.  However, given the “clear and present danger” represented by the threat of unlawful Bills of Detainer, we, the Petitioners, recognize the Patriot Act and the offending provisions of the NDAA (2012) as the most physically violent and lawless infringements to date. 
            The government of the “United States of America” as defined as “the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico….et alia” has become a very corrupt and criminal foreign government that has used its position of contractual trust for its own enrichment at the gross detriment of those it pretends to serve and it has by fraud, deceit, and presumption robbed three generations of Americans.  It stands ready now to imprison millions of us, confiscate our property, defame us, and further victimize the victims of this now ancient fraud.  
            There can be no wishy-washy, politically correct resolution.  The corporations masquerading as States must act in their own behalf and in behalf of the Petitioners, and do so promptly if a dreadful Miscarriage of Justice is to be prevented. 
            We will not be quiet again. If the Named Petitioner falls, another will rise up, and the justice of our actions and the truth of our cause will speak before the entire world in Courts of International Law.  As embarrassing as it is to admit that America has been this stupid, this ignorant, for this long----we will admit it.  We will freely admit it.  Indeed, we will claim it as our just defense. The victims of fraud are often the last ones to know it.  The pickpocket is here and gone.  The scammer on the telephone needs only a moment.   Honest, trusting, hard-working, generous, gullible Americans couldn’t imagine that their President and their Governors would commit gross fraud against them, and yet, it is self-evident that that is exactly what happened in 1933, the results of which fraud have continued on into the current day, operating under much the same prescription as was first promulgated by FDR. 
            The idea that we are all living in peonage was admittedly hard for the Petitioners, Inhabitants of Alaska, to accept, though the proof of it is all around us and we are living that truth every day.  Americans now pay over 70% of their income in aggregated taxes every year to the “king”.  A serf living in the greediest and most despotic kingdom of the Middle Ages paid less than half that amount. 
            The fact that our own beloved government has been claiming “US citizens” as “property” to be bought and sold and used as collateral for their debts since 1940, and has been relentlessly coercing Americans into clai
