This Started as a post but I had to change it into a document. I quickly realized how important this post would become and that people will want to refer to this document and the tax website I built frequently. <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftaxfacts.tripod.com%2F&amp;h=VAQFtBBig&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/taxfacts.tripod.com\/";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Ftaxfacts.tripod.com\u00252F&amp;h=VAQFtBBig&amp;s=1";);">http://taxfacts.tripod.com</a> is the website.
 
This post is designed to aide people in getting the criminal gestapo out of their lives which is commonly known to be masquerading as the IRS, which is really the United States Treasury doing business as the Internal Revenue Service. The criminal tax preparation professional lying idiots are now starting to mention obamacare in their ads. Remember everyone, Obamacare is 100% voluntary for EVERYONE including people who go with the routine. Section 1555 of H.R. 3590 the bill this legislation is based upon, makes the whole damned program voluntary. Hell this section is titled ";FREEDOM NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN FEDERAL HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS";, and it clearly states INDIVIDUALS. So everyone, its completely voluntary. Have you volunteered? For those who are like me and do not engage in W-4 withholding agreements this never had a chance of effecting us.
 
The constructive fraud is all of these congressmen and the executive branch appearing on this grand media stage and hyping up exemptions for certain companies. The only reason they bother to hype these exemptions in the first place is to create the perception to the people of an obligation which simply does not and cannot exist. The criminals get away with it because they are not actually doing anything unconstitutional, because the method by which it is implemented is the same as which socialist insecurity was implemented, by payroll deductions. And ALL of my members by now are certainly aware of how to handle payroll deductions and rogue payroll representatives that would disregard a notice to terminate the existing W-4 withholding agreement in violation of 26 C.F.R. 31.3402(p)-1(2)
 
The best way to get out ahead of this program is by nipping it in the bud and stomping it out in it's infancy. This Obamacare program and now this assault rifles ban are two very accurate examples of executive branch criminality. This monster has to be crushed before it can mature and grow into a true threat to this country. ONLY a massive education of the entire work force of this country is going to be sufficient to crush this. People have to fight this by fighting unlawful withholding at source. Just so it is understood, there is absolutely NO authority of law for ANY withholding from anyone's agreed upon pay absent the existence of a lawful court order, or a VOLUNTARILY executed W-4 agreement. And this agreement must be entered knowingly, intentionally, of ones own fully informed consent. Technically when an employer hand you this form they are in that moment giving you legal advice. They cannot advise you how to complete the form but they want you to complete it and then swear it is true and correct under penalty of perjury, and they will not even give you the instructions to complete this form. They will not give you the instructions page because that page proves this form is void, as it does not advise whether or not the information being requested is voluntary or mandatory. As such it is not in compliance with the paperwork reduction act and just like form 1040, form W-4 can be ignored without penalty of any form as it is a bootleg request. 5 C.F.R. 1320.6(a) itself literally IS your complete defense and bar with respect to ANY action regarding forms 1040 or W-4.
 
These tax professional liar idiot government bullshit shovelers are calling Obamacare also by the name of The Affordable Care Act. And just as with so many other pieces of unlawful, void, inapplicable, and unenforceable legislation you can tell it is not law because it says ACT right in the title of the program. These ACTS pretend to be law but only mimic it. The smoke and mirrors throughout the code are what have allowed the IRS agent with heir smug superiority to confuse the American people. The earnings of the people of this country have nothing to do with the nation's INTERNAL revenue whatsoever. For more on the income tax see the 100% free website I built over a decade ago. The link is below. There is nothing to sign up for, just click and start reading investigating and researching. It will quickly be made obvious that the income tax is not applicable to the  earnings of the average American.
 
People have to understand the scope and context of the 16th amendment as well as supreme court rulings that have never been over turned, which explain this all very well and were ruled AFTER social security and the gold seizure went into effect. Starting with the 16th amendment. We begin with the obvious, that the Constitution is applicable ONLY to the government NOT to the people, so when the Constitution says the government shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, that means from government itself as well as any source which government has created through the creation of taxable privileged activities, like Incorporation, or working abroad under a treaty protection, or a foreigner working here. Government can only tax lawful sources of revenue for the country, and those sources can only be entities that the government had the authority to create. Corporations for example owe their existence to chartered poweres granted by the State, so the corporation and its executive officers like the CEO and CFO are lawfully taxable. The taxable privilege of incorporation is is the ability to pass off debt and expenses to the public in pursuit of profit. In each case where an income tax is lawfully applicable it can be traced in it's applicability origins back to some privileged activity of government. this is why the average American's earning are NOT taxable at all lawfully.
 
Understand that the 16th amendment granted NO new taxing authority. So if it was not lawfully taxable BEFORE the 16th amendment, it is not lawfully taxable AFTER the 16th amendment. The supreme court has ruled that the only effect that the 16th amendment had is that it identified the income tax properly as an INDIRECT excise tax. Which is in agreement with what we understand about the nature of the tax being only upon privileged activities. Furthermore. The 16th amendment did NOT REPEAL the taxing clauses of article 1 section 2 of the constitution for these united states, in fact it is wholly in agreement with it. Title 26 surprisingly enough once one understands exactly how to read it, ALSO is in agreement with BOTH the taxing clauses of the constitution, the 16th amendment, and suprme court rulings upon this. There is absolutely no conflict between these rulings and the understanding that the income tax is not applicable to the law abiding sovereign inhabitants of this country. Both the 16th Amendment, and title 26 state that the tax is upon TAXABLE INCOME from whatever SOURCE derived, and the wording of the tax STATUTES as detailed by 26 USC 861 and the related regulations 26 CFR 1.861-1 through 26 CFR 1.861-14T determine the SOURCES of income for the purposes of the income tax. Section 26 CFR 1.861-8(f)(1) Specifically provides an ALL INCLUSIVE list of ALL of the operative sections which give rise to the STATUTORY GROUPINGS of gross income, which means the gross income from a specific source or activity which must first be determined in order to arrive at 'taxable income' which are the object of the income tax. And the earnings of the average American living and working exclusively within this country are NOT included in this inclusive list.
 
The most difficult aspect for people understand about reading legalese is the concept known as ";READING THE WHITE";. With an inclusive list for example, ALL that is NOT included, is EXCLUDED by law. So the earnings of the average American living and working exclusively within this country are excluded by law because tey were not included. This is not some oversight, it HAD to be done this way to be lawful, and HAD to be this complicated in order to get people to look no further in the income tax statutory rules than section 1-61 which is the section they all claim imposes the tax, but there IS no such ";shall be taxable"; phrase, and this section does NOT identify the sources of income for the purposes of the income tax. that section merely identifies some common items of income which may or may not be included in gross income, depending upon whether or not these ITEMS of income derive from the operative sections and statutory groupings of gross income. To make a long story short, if you live and work solely within this country your earnings are not subject to taxation because YOU are not a SUBJECT of anyone. Citations references and web link below. there are also citations below regarding the W-4 agreement.
 
As if all of that were not enough I have also included an explanation for this phenomenon that the employer mysteriously asserts that it has specific obligations to collect social security numbers, and this si absolutely true. An employer DOES have an obligation of law to collect social security numbers from those who they employ IF that individual is obligated to have one. if they are not the code provides for a waiver of penalties for the employer for failing to obtain an identifying number.
 
Sections 26 CFR 31.3402(a)-1, 26 CFR 31.3402(f)(2)-1(e), 26 CFR 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g), 26 CFR 31.3402-(n)(1), and 26 CFR 31.3402 (g)-1(a)(2) address Requirement of withholding, Withholding exemption certificates, Employees incurring no income tax liability, and Supplemental wage payments. All of these sections are here for context as curiously most employers assert a requirement to withhold from employees wages for income taxes. And the tax professionals that companies rely upon are most likely unaware of these sections of law or through cognitive dissonance have dismissed them. As seen below most Americans are not liable for income taxes on their domestic sources of income so one could easily make the statements in 26 CFR 31.3402-(n)(1) which are what constitutes a withholding exemption certificate. Tax professionals will try to confuse you with the W-4 exempt form which is STILL A WITHHOLDING AGREEMENT, not a WITHHOLDING EXEMPTION CERTIFICATE.
 
An employers requirements as shown in 26 CFR 31.3402(a)-1 and others like it are all nullified by 26 CFR 31.3402-(n)(1). It clearly establishes that a withholding exemption certificate is not a substitute W-4 and that the statements as described are what constitute the certificate, not the specified government form W-4. You will see it says W-4 no where in this section. The rules of 26 CFR 31.3402(f)(2)-1(e), and 26 CFR 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g). determine what is an INVALID withholding exemption certificate. (they cannot just arbitrarily determine your statements to be invalid only these sections authorize determining an invalid certificate.
 
 26 CFR 31.3402-(n)(1) Employees incurring no income tax liability. (a) i In general. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart (except to the extent a payment of wages is subject to withholding under 26 CFR 31.3402 (g)-1(a)(2), an employer shall not deduct and withhold any tax under chapter 24 upon a payment of wages made to an employee, if there is in effect with respect to the payment a withholding exemption certificate furnished to the employer by the employee which certifies that (1) The employee incurred no liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code for his preceding taxable year; and (2) The employee anticipates that he will incur no liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A for his current taxable year. Mandatory flat rate withholding. To the extent wages are subject to income tax withholding under 26 CFR 31.3402 (g)-1(a)(2), such wages are subject to such income tax withholding regardless of whether a withholding exemption certificate under section 3402(n) and the regulations thereunder has been furnished to the employer. Rules about withholding exemption certificates. For rules relating to invalid withholding exemption certificates, see 26 CFR 31.3402(f)(2)-1(e) , and for rules relating to disregarding certain withholding exemption certificates on which an employee claims a complete exemption from withholding, see 26 CFR 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g).
 
So this covers completely in depth all information you will need to shut your employer up regarding their alleged obligation to collect identifying numbers and their alleged obligation ti withhold for taxes. There is no obligation if you DO NOT enter into a W-4 voluntary agreement. The law itself shows exactly what is required of employers regarding this issue. 26 CFR 301.6109-1(c) and 26 USC 6109(a)(3) relate to the entity's requirement to REQUEST a social security number. But they also show that there is a waiver of penalties if they fail to obtain one pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §6724(a). They only need to show due diligence by signing an affidavit stating the REQUEST WAS MADE. <a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ittc.ku.edu%2Fbioinformatics%2FBIBM09%2FP_1Form.pdf&amp;h=bAQE-onqc&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmouseover="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/www.ittc.ku.edu\/bioinformatics\/BIBM09\/P_1Form.pdf";);" onclick="LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, ";http:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fwww.ittc.ku.edu\u00252Fbioinformatics\u00252FBIBM09\u00252FP_1Form.pdf&amp;h=bAQE-onqc&amp;s=1";);">http://www.ittc.ku.edu/bioinformatics/BIBM09/P_1Form.pdf</a> This is a link to the Reasonable Cause Affidavit by Payor. ANY employer can fill this out with respect to an individual they hire who does not use a social security number and who does NOT engage i VOLUNTARY W-4 withholding.
 
It was ruled in EEOC V Information Systems Consulting that signing an affidavit did not constitute an undue hardship upon a company. I would further argue that refusing to do this as an employer would be discrimination against your national origin of American as this sovereign inhabitant status entitles you to be able to live and work without a number. YOU are not the category of individual REQUIRED to be assigned a social security number pursuant to 42 USC 405(c)(2)(B)(i) . Furthermore it is a FELONY for an entity to compel an individual to disclose a social security number in violation of the laws of this country, and it WOULD be a violation of the laws of this country to force someone to participate in this program against their will. 42 U.S.C. 408 (a)(8). 42 U.S.C. 408 Penalties (a) In general Whoever - (8) discloses, uses, or compels the disclosure of the social security number of any person in violation of the laws of the United States; shall be guilty of a felony and upon conviction thereof shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both."; I did not write these laws they exist for a reason. Because when social security began people feared it would be used to implement a national ID card,  which they are trying to continue through real ID void statutory figments of the imagination. Pipe dreams that could never be law.
