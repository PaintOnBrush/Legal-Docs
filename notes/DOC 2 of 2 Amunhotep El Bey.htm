<span class="fbUnderline">MOTION TO DISMISS </span>
 
     COMES NOW, the defendant, Coralyn S. Hill, in pro-se; hereby, moves this honorable court to dismiss the above-styled cause due to lack of jurisdiction and other grounds as well. As grounds for this motion, the defendant will state as follows:
 
     The defendant is not a lawyer and his pleadings cannot be treated as such. In fact, according to Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519 (1972), a complaint, ";however inartfully pleaded,"; must be held to ";less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers"; and can only be dismissed for failure to state a claim if it appears ";beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief."; Id., at 520-521, quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).
 
<span class="fbUnderline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND FACTS</span>
 
     On March 32, 2012, at approximately, 11:30PM, the defendant was arrested and charged with two counts of Aggravated DUI – Passenger under 15, and possession of dangerous drug.
 
     The defendant was followed by officer Strake, who was cruising around the neighborhood, as the defendant went to go pick up her daughter and her friend about one mile away from the defendant’s house. Officer Strake, followed the defendant to the destination and when defendant turned onto the street where the kids were, officer Strake kept driving. (Both kids were 14 at the time). When we left to head home, officer Strake appeared again behind us, and followed us down Burke Road onto Guadalupe Avenue, and stopped us for allegedly making a wide right turn onto Lindsay. In fact, the report indicates that the defendant was going 80mph on Guadalupe Avenue, and skidded around both turns.
 
     No other cars were on the road, and defendant was making an immediate left, which is why the defendant went to the left lane. Strake, claims defendant crossed the double line into the other lane going North. On the report, Strake said that the defendant did this twice.
 
     The defendant was told to exit the vehicle, and was given FST’s (Field Sobriety Test) for over an hour. Each test at least 5-6 times. The defendant was wearing high heel flip flops, and when he took them off her pants drugged on the ground. Defendant also had a broken pinky toe at the time, which also hindered her ability to perform. The Defendant passed the tests

repeatedly, which was why Strake kept giving them to her over and over again. The Defendant was 100% sober, not impaired in the least, just upset from what Strake was doing. When Strake started in on another round of the same tests, defendant told him that she wanted to call her lawyer, because it was getting ridiculous.  Strake was obviously repeating the tests until the defendant failed, but she was completely sober, but was getting tired. Strake refused and told me that if I am arrested there are phones in the jail to call your lawyer.
 
     Strake took my pulse numerous times, each time he would count for 10 seconds then he multiply by 10. Screaming, “Your pulse is 150! Oh my God you’re on something!” The defendant informed him that he should multiply by 6, but he ignored me, and continued to do it wrong. I took it several times too, as I stood around while he figured out what he was going to do next. It was always between 13 – 15 beats/10 seconds, which is between 78 – 90.
 
     I asked for a breathalyzer and he refused. He said, “You’re giving me blood with a heart rate of 150!” Defendant told him again that she wanted to call her attorney, and he said, “There is nothing an attorney can do and he will tell you what I am telling you. If you are driving a car then you have to take whatever test I decide to give you. You don’t have a choice.”
 
     Then another cop arrived, and he told the defendant to sit on the curb. Strake excitedly informed this cop that, “Her heart rate is 150!” He then told the two kids to get out of the car, and he proceeded to tear the defendant’s car apart searching it. Strake, claimed I had a suspended license, which is untrue.
 
     Strake, took the defendant’s purse and dumped it on his car, and defendant had a prescription bottle with my friend’s name on it for Didrex, which is diet pills. Strake, asked defendant if it was speed or coke and defendant said neither. So he yelled right in defendant’s face, “Is it speed or coke?” three times. (Since when does speed or coke come in pill form?) Then he said, “Well I’ll just say it’s speed” to the other officer. He asked the defendant what the pills were for, and she told him to lose weight. It was Didrex that had been broken in ½ as per the prescription says to do. It’s crumbly so maybe that’s what Officer Strake was concerned with? The defendant was putting it in her coffee in the mornings to lose weight, because it is an appetite suppressant.
 
     The defendant was handcuffed and taken to the substation to “get her blood”. They towed her car and the 2 kids were driven to friend’s house by other officer, who told them that defendant was a speed freak and a drug dealer. The officer told her kid that she should never speak to defendant again because defendant was a terrible mother. Defendant’s daughter was hysterical.
 
     At the police dept Strake said they would get my blood and cut her loose. Defendant told him again that she wanted to talk to her attorney and that she was not giving blood, because she is phobic about needles. He told defendant that she doesn’t have a choice and she is not leaving until he gets it. He said that if defendant didn’t do it, she couldn’t leave, and that he will still take her blood, and then she would be off to jail.
 
     So Strake stood in front of defendant, another officer held her arm, and a third officer jammed in the needle. He missed the vein a couple of times, and defendant has big veins. He took about 3 vials, and threw them into the bin with other vials of blood. I think he is supposed
 
Page 3
 
to flip them a couple of times to mix with the chemicals, but he didn’t. There was no chain of custody, no initials on the vials, nothing. The defendant asked, “How are you going to know who’s is who’s?” There were three or four other people there too in custody, but they just ignored the defendant. The defendant has pictures that prove the damaged done to her arm by the officers. The defendant could barely move her arm after this happened, and it was bruised for weeks; and the defendant has other health problems as a result.
 
     After they took the blood by force, Strake started to do the same FSTs in the substation. He claims on the report that he “asked the defendant if she would do more tests,” which is untrue. Then he brought the defendant into another room and called a female officer in. He started shining a light into the defendant’s eyes and looking up her nose, and having the female officer look with him, like the defendant was a science experiment or something. By this time it was after 3am in the morning, and I’m sure the defendant’s eyes weren’t doing what they were supposed to do.
 
     He finally let the defendant do the Breathalyzer Test, which was “0.0”, then, released the defendant at approximately, 4:00am, in the morning.
 
     On June 28, 2013, a Grand Jury Indictment was issued without the presence of the defendant, in violations of the defendants 6th Amendment right to confront to your accusers. The court appointed counsel to the defendant without her consent; therefore, the court was in error by allowing court appointed counsel to do anything on her behalf, and everything that court appointed counsel has done is null and void. The defendant is the master of her own defense and has an absolute right to represent herself. In fact, Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to refuse counsel and represent themselves in state criminal proceedings.
 
     The defendant feels like the deck is stacked, because it is impossible to receive a fair trial when everyone works for the state? In other words, counsel, the judge, and prosecutor all have an Arizona Bar card, which is a state agency under the Arizona Supreme Court, so we have a conflict of interest here, because all of the said state officials have a special interest with the state. Court appointed counsel must be discharged or either this case must be dismissed as a result of this conflict of interest.
 
     As a result of these charges, the defendant hasn’t been able to find work as a software programmer, because when the companies do background checks the charges come up. The defendant was interviewed by two companies for software programming and everything when good and when the company did the background check the defendant was even considered anyway as a potential employer making six figures a year. The defendant is one the verge of losing everything because she can’t find work due to these charges.
 
<span class="fbUnderline">GROUND I. NO HOLDER-IN-DUE-COURSE AND NO CORPUS DELICTI</span>
 
<ul><li>(1.) The State of Arizona is not the injured party. How can the State of Arizona be the victim when the word OF means belonging to someone or something. Who owns the State of Arizona? Whoever owns Arizona has to prosecute this case, because whoever owns Arizona is the holder-in-due-course. The holder-in-due-course has to press charges. (See</li>
</ul> 
Page 4
 
<ul><li>UCC 3-308) All law is contract. Contract is commercial business; therefore, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) applies. The UCC governs all business transactions and corporations. The UCC is International Law.</li>
</ul> 
<ul><li>(2.) On December 26, 1933, 49 Statute 3097, Treaty Series 881, “Convention on Rights and Duties of States,” CONGRESS replaced STATUTES with international law, placing all states under international law. Therefore, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) applies to the United States, which is a federal corporation according to Title 28 USC section 3002 (15)(A). Also see, William Dixon v. The United States, 1 Marsh 117, 181 (1811), Justice John Marshall explained that ";The United States"; was a corporation and all of the politicians were the officers of that corporation.</li>
</ul> 
<ul><li>(3.) For a crime to exist there must be an injured party (Corpus Delicti). There can be no sanction or penalty imposed on one because of this Constitutional Right. (See Sherer v. Cullen 481 F. 945.)</li>
</ul> 
<ul><li>(4.) The Black’s Law Dictionary defines Corpus Delicti as follows:</li>
</ul> 
Corpus Delicti: The body of the offence; the essence of the crime.
 
It was a general rule not to convict unless the corpus delicti can be established, that is, until the dead body has been found. Instances have occurred of a person being convicted of having killed another, who, after the supposed criminal has been put to death for the supposed offence, has made his appearance.
 
Alive. The wisdom of the rule is apparent; but in order to insure justice, in extreme cases, it may be competent to prove the basis of the corpus delicti by presumptive, but conclusive, evidence.
 
     The state of Arizona is not a flesh and blood victim, because the state of Arizona is a corporation; therefore, it is not and will never be the Corpus Delicti. A Corporation is dead or artificial at law because it is not real. Hence, the Latin word, “corpse,” which means dead body. The word corporation is derived from the Latin word corpse, so the significance of the etymology of the word corpse is very clear when proving that a corporation is not real because it is dead.
 
<ul><li>(5.) Can the state produce the signature of the owner of Arizona, as the holder-in-due course, and a flesh and blood victim, as the Corpus Delicti? The state cannot produce and has failed to produce neither; therefore, the defendant and the state can never have a valid contract and this case must be dismissed, because the parties can never have a valid contract. No contact equals to no jurisdiction.</li>
</ul> 
<ul><li>(6.) The State of Arizona has to present the signature of the owner of Arizona, as the holder in due course, and the Corpus Delicti (flesh and blood victim), in order to press charges against this defendant, which is all necessary to have a valid contract. All law is contract. In other words, there is no contract without the signature of the holder in due course and the Corpus Delicti. “If there is no contract there is no case.” (See Erie Railroad Company</li>
</ul> 
Page 5
 
<ul><li>vs. Tompkins, 304 US 64 (1938). All of the contracts the defendant has ever entered with the state of Arizona are void.</li>
</ul> 
<ul><li>(7.) The State of Arizona is contracting with this defendant without the proper authorization, because there is and was no signature from the holder-in-due-course, and without the Corpus Delicti, a flesh and blood victim, as the state of Arizona; therefore, this case must be dismissed, because no valid contract exists for prosecution.</li>
</ul> 
<ul><li>(8.) The plaintiff must provide proof of signatures and status as holder in due course, according to Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 3-308, in order to have a valid contract. The state has failed to produce the signature of the holder in due course; therefore, if there is no contract there is no case (see Erie Railroad Company vs. Tompkins, 304 US 64 (1938).</li>
</ul>
