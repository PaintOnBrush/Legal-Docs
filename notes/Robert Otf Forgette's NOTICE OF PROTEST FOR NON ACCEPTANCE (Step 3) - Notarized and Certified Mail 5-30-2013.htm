Robert Otf Forgette's NOTICE OF PROTEST FOR NON ACCEPTANCE: (Step 3) - Notarized and Certified Mail 5-30-2013 FROM: Robert-Michael: Of the Forgette Family*****ADDRESS*****These united states of America TO: Montgomery County RecordsCounty Clerk: Mark Turnbull210 W Davis St, Conroe, TX 77301These united states of America NOTICE OF PROTEST FOR NON ACCEPTANCE NOTICE TO AGENT IS NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL. NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL IS NOTICE TO AGENT. VALID RESPONSES MUST BE RECEIVED WITHIN 15 DAYS AND BE REGISTERED IN THIS NOTARY PUBLIC OFFICE UNDER OATH, BOND, AND FULL COMMERCIAL LIABILITY. Dear County Clerk: Mark Turnbull, I have received a couple of letters in the mail regarding the Affidavit I have sent to your office declaring Allodial Ownership of my property. These messages from the county attorney are NOT valid responses, as they are not given under oath and contain ONLY legal opinions. The ‘Affidavit Declaring Allodial Ownership” of my property is sworn true under penalty of perjury, it is not an opinion. Understand this, if there is no VALID response to this FINAL NOTICE of Protest for your non acceptance of my affidavit, criminal charges will be filed against both YOU the recorder AND the attorney, as well as a massive civil suit against both of you personally, as well as the county. Your offices failure to accept and record this affidavit with respect to the referenced property, is a violation of my fundamental birthright to own property. Not ONLY that, it constitutes “deprivation of rights under color of law” in violation of 18 U.S.C 242 and it ALSO constitutes CONSPIRACY AGAINST RIGHT in violation of 18 U.S.C. 241. The county attorney and YOU, have prima facie colluded and conspired to deprive me of rights that are so fundamental, freedom cannot exist without them. The legal opinions sent to me by the county attorney are further attempts to deprive me of rights under color of law and as you can see, they are not successful. As a MAXIM of law ANYTHING which OUGHT to be done, MUST be seen as having BEEN done. Just so we are clear on this point, you have an obligation to record this affidavit with respect to that property. If you do not, from a perspective of law, it will still be as if you had, the only difference is that criminal and civil charges will follow if you do not. This is NOT A REQUEST. You are hereby ORDERED and REQUIRED to record the TRUTHFUL affidavit I have served upon you with respect to the referenced property.  Page 2 of 2 This final notice is being sent offering discussion in hope of avoiding this foreseeable, potential conflict. My rights are not in dispute here, there has been no dispute of any kind here, just invalid legal opinions that were not solicited from some attorney. I do not require legal advice. Any more INVALID responses will continue to be treated as if there was NO response. Failure to PROPERLY enter a VALID response to this notice WILL result in a declaratory judgment of permanent estoppel and Acquiescence, forever barring dispute in this matter in the future and will constitute a shared understanding of all matters not in dispute. If there is no response to this FINAL NOTICE, it will be assumed that the ORIGINAL AFFIDAVIT declaring Allodial Ownership of the referenced property HAS been recorded. In either case, YOU, the COUNTY, including the Sheriff and all of his subordinates, are hereby ON NOTICE regarding the lawful ownership of the referenced property. Your refusal to properly record this affidavit will not be tolerated as an excuse for your ignorance, should any form of conflict arise in the future related to this matter. Allodial ownership of property is a fundamental birthright, unless of course you are suggesting that one can have a right to own property AND simultaneously have an obligation to sign that property over to the state, in order to acquire the lawful authority to use and enjoy that property for its lawful intended purpose. But again, since that contention has not been delivered in a VALID response I am assuming that is not the case. Good day to you and please do not have that tool of England contact me again or further attempt to intimidate me, to deprive me of rights under color of law. Those legal opinions are not law, are not valid and do not have any bearing upon YOUR DUTY as a county recorder. You will not escape my peaceful lawful recourse if you fail to record this document. I will prosecute you personally to the fullest extent of the law possible, should your attempts to violate my rights continue. Just so it is clear, this is a CRIME. Again, VALID responses must be under oath, bond, full commercial liability and received within fifteen (15) days from the date this notice is received. This notice is being sent in good faith without intent of causing undue harassment, but solely to enforce lawfully, the exercise of my lawful rights. Any and ALL necessary action after this, as this, will be peaceful, lawful and according to existing remedies already amply available at law. Thank you very much for your time and cooperation.  Sincerely, Autograph: ______________________________  Date: ____ - ____ - ________                Robert-Michael: Of the Forgette Family  Notary:
