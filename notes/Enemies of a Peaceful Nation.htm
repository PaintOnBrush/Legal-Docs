From the President's Desk, March 25, 2011
 
Greetings Fellow Senecas!  In this message, I thought I would take a different approach than in my prior messages. Rather than simply provide you with an update on some of the activities that Nation Officials have been engaged in, I thought I would provide you with some analysis of how and why we engage in one of our very important government functions - the process of defending and protecting the Seneca Nation's sovereignty.
 
 The Threats. As you might realize, the Nation is constantly under attack from outside forces. These forces are numerous, but here is a partial list:
 
1. The United States - Even though the Nation has treaties with the U.S. government that recognizes the ";free use and enjoyment"; of our lands, the U.S. government periodically tries to assert authority over our lands and people in violation of those treaties. The current U.S. treat takes the form of the various federal agencies that seek to exercise American power within the Nation's territories. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency has in the recent past sought to require the Nation to obtain federal permits to do business in our own lands. Another example is the National Labor Relations Board, which has been involved in union-organizing efforts at our casinos. While the Nation is always willing to address issues raised by the U.S., our treaty is clear that the Nation has primary authority in our own territory.
 
2. The State of New York - New York is by far the greatest threat to the Nation's sovereignty and has been so for over 200 years. The Nation has no treaties with the State, and so the State and it's officials behave as though they have no obligation under federal treaties to respect the Nation's sovereignty. The recent cigarette tax collection effort is but one in a series of efforts by the State to undermine the Nation's sovereignty and land title. Other historic examples of the State's rogue behavior include lobbying Congress for criminal and civil jurisdiction over our lands in 1948 and 1950, and taking illegal rights-of-way for the N.Y.S. Thruway and Southern Tier Expressway.
 
3. Local Governments - Periodically, local governments also seek to assert authority over the Nation and our people. The City of Salamanca, given its location in our territory, is a continuous source of conflict and disagreement Oftentimes, county and town governments seek to exercise authority since our territory has been designated as being located within county and town boundary lines. Areas where these assertions arise include child protection services and vehicle and traffic regulation.
 
4. Corporations and other Business Interests - Since our first contact with non-Indians, we have been struggling to protect ourselves from efforts to take our land and resources for money making purposes. Because our lands are valuable, non-Indians have always wanted to steal them. Because they couldn't get all our lands, they wanted rights-of-way for utility lines and gravel mining. Today, our casinos make a lot of money and so there is a long line of people trying to find ways to steal from us. Both Senecas and non-Senecas can be involved in these efforts, as the recent Lewiston golf course scandal highlights.
 
Historic Defense. In the old days - that is, before we had treaties of peace with the Americans - our Nation primarily relied upon three different methods for protecting the Nation. First, we used diplomacy. Diplomacy is the process by which government representatives seek to resolve problems that may arise through dialogue and negotiation. Second, we used trade. We Senecas have never been isolationists. We have always been engaged in our world around us and traveled far and wide to interact with our peoples and bring them under our influence. Engaging in trading activities, e.g. commerce, has been an essential ingredient in protecting our Nation from harm. In short, if you are trading partners with another people, it is much more unlikely that they will want to bring harm to you. And lastly, we relied upon warfare. Warfare is as old as humanity. When all else fails, fighting to the death is the ultimate last option. History reflects that the Seneca warrior spirit was not an accident. Our people have long been skilled in methods of defending our Nation through warfare.
 
Modern Defense - Litigation. The modern era of the Nation's self-defense began following the Canandaigua Treaty of 1974. In that treaty, we and the other Six Nations agreed to live in peace with the Americans and never take up arms against them. Because of this, warfare - as a legal matter - was removed from our box of self-defense tools. (If we ever want the legal option of warfare restored, we must break our treaty with the United States.)
 
  So, in the absence of warfare, the Nation picked up the modern equivalent of warfare - litigation. Beginning in the 19th century, Nation officials would seek to  utilize litigation in the American (and sometimes, State) courts to protect the Nation's interests. The big catch was that the Nation as a sovereign government had no authority to enter the American court system without the permission of the United States government. So, the process involved petitioning American officials to bring suit in the American courts on behalf of the Nation. For example, this happened in the 1942 case of U.S. v Forness where the Nation successfully petitioned the U.S. government to evict a tenant in Salamanca for non-payment of rent that was due, as well as in 1994, when 16 Salamanca residents refused to sign a new 40/40 lease.
 
  In 1966, the U.S. amended its court rules to allow the Nation and all Indian nations and tribes to bring suit in their own name. The Nation has had to bring suit using this provision every few years. I believe the first instance of the Nation doing this was the case of SNI v NYS back in the early 1970's, when the State was trying to apply its eminent domain law to take Nation lands for the Southern Tier Expressway right-of-way. More recently, the Nation succeeded in federal court to regain clear title to 50 acres of Oil Spring Territory and to protect the jurisdiction of the Peacemakers Court against a State court judge. The Nation has also not succeeded in federal court, such as in the Grand Island litigation.
 
  The limitation on the effectiveness of litigation, of course, is that the United States writes the rules of engagement. States write the rules of engagement. Because of this fact, it is impossible to use American courts to achieve a full measure of justice for the Nation. Even when the merits of a case are crystal clear, such as when New York and it's officials stole Six Nations' lands in violation of the federal Non-intercourse acts, the courts have eventually sided with the non-Indians. Sometimes justice can prevail, but it is unwise to rely completely on the American courts to protect the Nation's interests. Increasingly, we have sought to use the Nation's own courts for interpretation of our own rights.
 
Modern Defense - Political Engagement. Like our forefathers did long ago, the Nation's officials today still rely heavily upon diplomacy to protect the Nation's interests. Given the multitude of threats, discussion remains the cheapest and easiest way to prevent problems from escalating in intensity. There should be no mistake that sometimes this diplomatic ";discussion"; can be quite vigorous and heated. We routinely assert strong positions that outside governments have no authority over the Nation's lands. We prevail more often than you may realize, without a shot fired or a lawsuit filed. Once they are properly educated, I believe that outside government officials realize that the Nation takes its sovereignty seriously. Indeed, our reputation often precedes us. There is no question that the willingness of the Seneca people to fight back attempts to destroy our sovereignty - such as happened  int he 1992 and 1997 conflicts with the State - has set the foundation for years of diplomatic success.
 
  During the last few years, the Nation has had assistance in our diplomatic efforts by hiring lobbyists in Washington and Albany. These professional ";influencers"; know the ins-and-outs of the federal and State political systems and are extremely helpful in making sure the Nation's message is understood and our interests are asserted. Like any human system, there are always ";unwritten"; rules of engagement. Our lobbyists help us Nation officials to effectively communicate and achieve our goals in the federal and State systems.
 
  As evidence of this, I would say that the last two years have generated the greatest degree of engagement with federal and State officials than we have had for perhaps 200 years. We now regularly receive the help of local members of Congress and the State legislature on matters that affect us, such as when State Senators George Maziarz, Mark Grisanti, and Cathy Young all testified on our behalf during the recent Kinzua scoping meeting with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Indeed, at our Canvass Day ceremonies in November we had two members of Congress in attendance and representation from a dozen representatives and county officials. This, frankly, is new found respect.
 
  An important new component in our relationship building with outside government officials has been political contributions. During the last two years, the Nation has made significant political contributions to candidates and political parties who support us. We have also made contributions against those who are our adversaries, as well as funded direct mail solicitations to potential voters to educate them on who are the Nation's friends and foes. The source of these funds has been the import fees collected by Seneca businesses. A few Senecas have argued that these donations violate the Two Row Wampum, in that they involve the Nation in the American political system. I disagree. I believe that as long as we do not get personally involved in the American system through voting or holding American political office, then our respect for the Two Row Wampum is maintained. There is no question in my mind that being able to financially support American candidates and political parties that support the Nation has been the most effective method for building allies to help protect our interests. Conclusion. I have no doubt that, if push comes to shove, the Seneca people will always be the source of greatest strength when defending our Nation. But my goal as President is to ensure that you are able to maintain a peaceful and fruitful life and not have to personally take up defensive action to protect our Nation. That is why you elected us Councillors and Executives - to protect your interests and our Nation from our adversaries. I wish that we did not have to spend millions of dollars to protect our inherent sovereignty and our treaty rights that were promised to us long ago, but we must. I am not sure we will ever find lasting peace, but we must always make sure we have leaders in place that will wisely protect our sovereignty and keep safe our future generations and our cherished lands.
