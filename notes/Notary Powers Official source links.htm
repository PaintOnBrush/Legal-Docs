Section 3--509. Protest; Noting for Protest.
    (1)  A  protest  is  a certificate of dishonor made under the hand and
  seal of a United States consul or vice consul  or  a  notary  public  or
  other  person  authorized  to  certify  dishonor by the law of the place
  where dishonor occurs. It may be made upon information  satisfactory  to
  such person.
    (2)  The  protest must identify the instrument and certify either that
  due presentment has been made or the reason why it is excused  and  that
  the instrument has been dishonored by nonacceptance or nonpayment.
    (3)  The  protest  may  also  certify that notice of dishonor has been
  given to all parties or to specified parties.
    (4) Subject to subsection (5) any necessary protest is due by the time
  that notice of dishonor is due.
    (5) If, before protest is  due,  an  instrument  has  been  noted  for
  protest  by  the officer to make protest, the protest may be made at any
  time thereafter as of the date of the noting.
Curiously some Notaries will asserty that may is permissive, however this contention has been proven by the courts to be incorrect.  ";may"; is  not permissive, “may” means “must” or “shall” according to 34 Am Jur. Section 72. Also as worded in Pape v. Dept. of Labor &amp; Indus., 43 Wn.2d 736, 741, 264 P.2d 241 (1953). the word is interpreted to mean “shall” or “must” whenever the rights of the public or of third persons depend upon the exercise of the power or performance of the duty to which it refers. “.
