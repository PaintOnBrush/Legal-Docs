    <P>The following brief has been used in at least three states as a legal 
    brief to support a demand for dismissal of charges of "driving without a 
    license." It is the argument that was the reason for charges being dropped, 
    or for a "win" in court against the argument that free people can have their 
    right to travel regulated by their servants. </P>
    <P>The forgotten legal maxim is that free people have a right to travel on 
    the roads which are provided by their servants for that purpose, using 
    ordinary transportation of the day. Licensing cannot be required of free 
    people, because taking on the restrictions of a license requires the 
    surrender of a right. The driver's license can be required of people who use 
    the highways for trade, commerce, or hire; that is, if they earn their 
    living on the road, and if they use extraordinary machines on the roads. In 
    other words, if you are not using the highways for profit, you cannot be 
    required to have a driver's license. </P>
    <P>This brief or the right it demonstrates is no substitute for either being 
    safe on the road or for learning the subject of rights versus regulations 
    thoroughly before attempting to use or act upon this information. </P>
    <P>This brief demonstrates in substantive form the manner in which the 
    inherent rights of We The People have been "surrendered to the State" 
    through un-awareness of those rights, or un-wittingly, or under coercion and 
    threat, entering into a "voluntary" contract with the "State". See <A 
    href="http://www.barefootsworld.net/nockoets0.html">Our Enemy, the 
    STATE"</A> </P>
    <P>This brief may be used as a model for briefs for Dismissal in other 
    actions where a Citizen's Common Law Constitutionally Protected Rights have 
    been violated. Just be absolutely certain that all cites and references are 
    factual and directly to the instant case. See <A

    <P><B>NOW, comes the Accused,</B> appearing specially and not generally or 
    voluntarily, but under threat of arrest for failing to do so, with this 
    "BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF NOTICE FOR DISMISSAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION," stating 
    as follows: </P>
    <P>
    <CENTER><FONT size=+2><B>ARGUMENT</B></FONT></CENTER>
    <P></P>
    <P>If ever a judge understood the right of the public to use the public 
    roads, it was Justice Tolman of the Supreme Court of the State of 
    Washington.<BR></P>
    <P>Justice Tolman stated: 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Complete freedom of the highways is so old and well 
      established a blessing that we have forgotten the days of the Robber 
      Barons and toll roads, and yet, under an act like this, arbitrarily 
      administered, the highways may be completely monopolized, if, through lack 
      of interest, the people submit, then they may look to see the most sacred 
      of their liberties taken from them one by one, by more or less rapid 
      encroachment." <I>Robertson vs. Department of Public Works</I>, 180 Wash 
      133, 147. </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>The words of Justice Tolman ring most prophetically in the ears of 
    Citizens throughout the country today as the use of the public roads has 
    been monopolized by the very entity which has been empowered to stand guard 
    over our freedoms, i.e., that of state government. </P>
    <P>
    <CENTER><FONT size=+2><B>RIGHTS</B></FONT></CENTER>
    <P></P>
    <P>The "most sacred of liberties" of which Justice Tolman spoke was personal 
    liberty. The definition of personal liberty is: </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Personal liberty, or the Right to enjoyment of life and 
      liberty, is one of the fundamental or natural Rights, which has been 
      protected by its inclusion as a guarantee in the various constitutions, 
      which is not derived from, or dependent on, the U.S. Constitution, which 
      may not be submitted to a vote and may not depend on the outcome of an 
      election. It is one of the most sacred and valuable Rights, as sacred as 
      the Right to private property...and is regarded as inalienable." 16 
      C.J.S., Constitutional Law, Sect.202, p.987.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>This concept is further amplified by this definition of personal liberty: 
    </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Personal liberty largely consists of the Right of locomotion 
      to go where and when one pleases only so far restrained as the Rights of 
      others may make it necessary for the welfare of all other citizens. The 
      Right of the Citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport 
      his property thereon, by horsedrawn carriage, wagon, or automobile, <B>is 
      not a mere privilege which may be permitted or prohibited at will,</B> but 
      the common Right which he has under his Right to life, liberty, and the 
      pursuit of happiness. Under this Constitutional guarantee one may, 
      therefore, under normal conditions, travel at his inclination along the 
      public highways or in public places, and while conducting himself in an 
      orderly and decent manner, neither interfering with nor disturbing 
      another's Rights, he will be protected, not only in his person, but in his 
      safe conduct." [emphasis added] II Am.Jur. (1st) Constitutional Law, 
      Sect.329, p.1135.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>and further... </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Personal liberty consists of the power of locomotion, of 
      changing situations, of removing one's person to whatever place one's 
      inclination may direct, without imprisonment or restraint unless by due 
      process of law." 1 <I>Blackstone's Commentary</I> 134; Hare, Constitution. 
      777; <I>Bovier's Law Dictionary</I>, 1914 ed., <I>Black's Law 
      Dictionary</I>, 5th ed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>Justice Tolman was concerned about the State prohibiting the Citizen from 
    the "most sacred of his liberties," the Right of movement, the Right of 
    moving one's self from place to place without threat of imprisonment, the 
    Right to use the public roads in the ordinary course of life. </P>
    <P>When the State allows the formation of a corporation it may control its 
    creation by establishing guidelines (statutes) for its operation (charters). 
    Corporations who use the roads in the course of business do not use the 
    roads in the ordinary course of life. There is a difference between a 
    corporation and an individual. The United States Supreme Court has stated: 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"...We are of the opinion that there is a clear distinction in 
      this particular between an individual and a corporation, and that the 
      latter has no right to refuse to submit its books and papers for 
      examination on the suit of the State. The individual may stand upon his 
      Constitutional Rights as a Citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private 
      business in his own way. His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no 
      duty to the State or to his neighbors to divulge his business, or to open 
      his doors to investigation, so far as it may tend to incriminate him. 
      <P></P>
      <P>"He owes no such duty to the State, since he receives nothing 
      therefrom, beyond the protection of his life, liberty, and property. His 
      Rights are such as the law of the land long antecedent to the organization 
      of the state, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in 
      accordance with the Constitution. Among his Rights are the refusal to 
      incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his property from 
      arrest or seizure except under warrant of law. He owes nothing to the 
      public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights. </P>
      <P>"Upon the other hand, the corporation is a creature of the state. It is 
      presumed to be incorporated for the benefit of the public. It receives 
      certain special privileges and franchises, and holds them subject to the 
      laws of the state and the limitations of its charter. Its rights to act as 
      a corporation are only preserved to it so long as it obeys the laws of its 
      creation. There is a reserved right in the legislature to investigate its 
      contracts and find out whether it has exceeded its powers. It would be a 
      strange anomaly to hold that the State, having chartered a corporation to 
      make use of certain franchises, could not in exercise of its sovereignty 
      inquire how those franchises had been employed, and whether they had been 
      abused, and demand the production of corporate books and papers for that

    <P><B>The distinction is made very clear in Title 18 USC 31:</B> </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Motor vehicle" means every description or other contrivance

      directly or indirectly in connection with any business, or other 
      undertaking intended for profit. </P>
      <P>Clearly, an automobile is private property in use for private purposes,

    <CENTER><B>TRAVEL</B></CENTER>
    <P></P>
    <P>The term "travel" is a significant term and is defined as: </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"The term 'travel' and 'traveler' are usually construed in 
      their broad and general sense...so as to include all those who rightfully 
      use the highways viatically (when being reimbursed for expenses) and who 
      have occasion to pass over them for the purpose of business, convenience, 
      or pleasure." [emphasis added] 25 Am.Jur. (1st) Highways, Sect.427, p.717. 

      <P></P>
      <P>"Traveler: One who passes from place to place, whether for pleasure, 
      instruction, business, or health." <I>Locket vs. State</I>, 47 Ala. 45; 
      <I>Bovier's Law Dictionary</I>, 1914 ed., p. 3309. </P>
      <P>"Travel: To journey or to pass through or over; as a country district, 
      road, etc. To go from one place to another, whether on foot, or horseback, 
      or in any conveyance as a train, an automobile, carriage, ship, or 
      aircraft; Make a journey." <I>Century Dictionary</I>, 
    p.2034.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>Therefore, the term "travel" or "traveler" refers to one who uses a 
    conveyance to go from one place to another, and included all those who use 
    the highways as a matter of Right. </P>
    <P>otice that in all these definitions the phrase "for hire" never occurs. 
    This term "travel" or "traveler" implies, by definition, one who uses the 
    road as a means to move from one place to another. </P>
    <P>Therefore, one who uses the road in the ordinary course of life and 
    business for the purpose of travel and transportation is a traveler. </P>
    <P>
    <CENTER><B>DRIVER</B></CENTER>
    <P></P>
    <P>The term "driver" in contradistinction to "traveler" is defined as: </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Driver: One employed in conducting a coach, carriage, wagon, 
      or other vehicle..." <I>Bovier's Law Dictionary</I>, 1914 ed., p. 
    940.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>Notice that this definition includes one who is "employed" in conducting 
    a vehicle. It should be self-evident that this person could not be 
    "travelling" on a journey, but is using the road as a place of business. 
</P>
    <P>
    <CENTER><B>OPERATOR</B></CENTER>
    <P></P>
    <P>Today we assume that a "traveler" is a "driver," and a "driver" is an 
    "operator." <B>However, this is not the case.</B> </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"It will be observed from the language of the ordinance that a 
      distinction is to be drawn between the terms 'operator' and 'driver'; the 
      'operator' of the service car being the person who is licensed to have the 
      car on the streets in the business of carrying passengers for hire; while 
      the 'driver' is the one who actually drives the car. However, in the 
      actual prosecution of business, it was possible for the same person to be 
      both 'operator' and 'driver.'" <I>Newbill vs. Union Indemnity Co.</I>, 60 
      SE.2d 658.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>To further clarify the definition of an "operator" the court observed 
    that this was a vehicle "for hire" and that it was in the business of 
    carrying passengers. </P>
    <P>This definition would seem to describe a person who is using the road as 
    a place of business, or in other words, a person engaged in the "privilege" 
    of using the road for gain. </P>
    <P>This definition, then, is a further clarification of the distinction 
    mentioned earlier, and therefore: </P>
    <P>Travelling upon and transporting one's property upon the public roads as 
    a matter of Right meets the definition of a traveler. </P>
    <P>Using the road as a place of business as a matter of privilege meets the 
    definition of a driver or an operator or both. </P>
    <P>
    <CENTER><B>TRAFFIC</B></CENTER>
    <P></P>
    <P>Having defined the terms "automobile," "motor vehicle," "traveler," 
    "driver," and "operator," the next term to define is "traffic": </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"...Traffic thereon is to some extent destructive, therefore, 
      the prevention of unnecessary duplication of auto transportation service 
      will lengthen the life of the highways or reduce the cost of maintenance, 
      the revenue derived by the state...will also tend toward the public 
      welfare by producing at the expense of those operating for private gain, 
      some small part of the cost of repairing the wear..." <I>Northern Pacific 
      R.R. Co. vs. Schoenfeldt</I>, 213 P. 26.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>Note: In the above, Justice Tolman expounded upon the key of raising 
    revenue by taxing the "privilege" to use the public roads "at the expense of 
    those operating for gain." </P>
    <P>In this case, the word "traffic" is used in conjunction with the 
    unnecessary Auto Transportation Service, or in other words, "vehicles for 
    hire." The word "traffic" is another word which is to be strictly construed 
    to the conducting of business. </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Traffic: Commerce, trade, sale or exchange of merchandise, 
      bills, money, or the like. The passing of goods and commodities from one 
      person to another for an equivalent in goods or money..."; <I>Bovier's Law 
      Dictionary</I>, 1914 ed., p. 3307.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>Here again, notice that this definition refers to one "conducting 
    business." No mention is made of one who is travelling in his automobile. 
    This definition is of one who is engaged in the passing of a commodity or 
    goods in exchange for money, i.e.., vehicles for hire. </P>
    <P>Furthermore, the word "traffic" and "travel" must have different meanings 
    which the courts recognize. The difference is recognized in <I>Ex Parte 
    Dickey</I>, supra: </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"..in addition to this, cabs, hackney coaches, omnibuses, 
      taxicabs, and hacks, when unnecessarily numerous, interfere with the 
      ordinary traffic and travel and obstruct them."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>The court, by using both terms, signified its recognition of a 
    distinction between the two. But, what was the distinction? We have already 
    defined both terms, but to clear up any doubt: </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"The word 'traffic' is manifestly used here in secondary 
      sense, and has reference to the business of transportation rather than to 
      its primary meaning of interchange of commodities." <I>Allen vs. City of 
      Bellingham</I>, 163 P. 18.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>Here the Supreme Court of the State of Washington has defined the word 
    "traffic" (in either its primary or secondary sense) in reference to 
    business, and not to mere travel! So it is clear that the term "traffic" is 
    business related and therefore, it is a "privilege." The net result being 
    that "traffic" is brought under the (police) power of the legislature. The 
    term has no application to one who is not using the roads as a place of 
    business. </P>
    <P>
    <CENTER><FONT size=+1><B>LICENSE</B></FONT></CENTER>
    <P></P>
    <P>It seems only proper to define the word "license," as the definition of 
    this word will be extremely important in understanding the statutes as they 
    are properly applied: </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"The permission, by competent authority to do an act which 
      without permission, would be illegal, a trespass, or a tort." <I>People 
      vs. Henderson</I>, 218 NW.2d 2, 4. 
      <P></P>
      <P>"Leave to do a thing which licensor could prevent." <I>Western Electric 
      Co. vs. Pacent Reproducer Corp.</I>, 42 F.2d 116, 118.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>In order for these two definitions to apply in this case, the state would 
    have to take up the position that the exercise of a Constitutional Right to 
    use the public roads in the ordinary course of life and business is illegal, 
    a trespass, or a tort, which the state could then regulate or prevent. </P>
    <P>This position, however, would raise magnitudinous Constitutional 
    questions as this position would be diametrically opposed to fundamental 
    Constitutional Law. (See "Conversion of a Right to a Crime," infra.) </P>
    <P>In the instant case, the proper definition of a "license" is: </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"a permit, granted by an appropriate governmental body, 
      <B>generally for consideration,</B> to a person, firm, or corporation, 
      <B>to pursue some occupation or to carry on some business which is subject 
      to regulation under the police power.</B>" [emphasis added] <I>Rosenblatt 
      vs. California State Board of Pharmacy</I>, 158 P.2d 199, 203.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>This definition would fall more in line with the "privilege" of carrying 
    on business on the streets. </P>
    <P>Most people tend to think that "licensing" is imposed by the state for 
    the purpose of raising revenue, yet there may well be more subtle reasons 
    contemplated; for when one seeks permission from someone to do something he 
    invokes the jurisdiction of the "licensor" which, in this case, is the 
    state. In essence, the licensee may well be seeking to be regulated by the 
    "licensor." </P>

    <CENTER><FONT size=+1><B>POLICE POWER</B></FONT></CENTER>
    <P></P>
    <P>The confusion of the police power with the power of taxation usually 
    arises in cases where the police power has affixed a penalty to a certain 
    act, or where it requires licenses to be obtained and a certain sum be paid 
    for certain occupations. The power used in the instant case cannot, however, 
    be the power of taxation since an attempt to levy a tax upon a Right would 
    be open to Constitutional objection. (See "taxing power," infra.) </P>
    <P>Each law relating to the use of police power must ask three questions: 
    </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"1. Is there threatened danger? 2. Does a regulation involve a 
      Constitutional Right? 3. Is this regulation reasonable?" <I>People vs. 
      Smith</I>, 108 Am.St.Rep. 715; <I>Bovier's Law Dictionary</I>, 1914 ed., 
      under "Police Power."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>When applying these three questions to the statute in question, some very 
    important issues emerge. </P>
    <P>First, "is there a threatened danger" in the individual using his 
    automobile on the public highways, in the ordinary course of life and 
    business? </P>
    <P>The answer is No! There is nothing inherently dangerous in the use of an 
    automobile when it is carefully managed. Their guidance, speed, and noise 
    are subject to a quick and easy control, under a competent and considerate 
    manager, it is as harmless on the road as a horse and buggy. </P>
    <P>It is the manner of managing the automobile, and that alone, which 
    threatens the safety of the public. The ability to stop quickly and to 
    respond quickly to guidance would seem to make the automobile one of the 
    least dangerous conveyances. (See <I>Yale Law Journal</I>, December, 1905.) 
    </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"The automobile is not inherently dangerous." <I>Cohens vs. 
      Meadow</I>, 89 SE 876; <I>Blair vs. Broadmore</I>, 93 SE 532.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>To deprive all persons of the Right to use the road in the ordinary 
    course of life and business, because one might, in the future, become 
    dangerous, would be a deprivation not only of the Right to travel, but also 
    the Right to due process. (See "Due Process," infra.) </P>
    <P>Next, does the regulation involve a Constitutional Right? </P>
    <P>This question has already been addressed and answered in this brief, and 
    need not be reinforced other than to remind this Court that this Citizen 
    does have the Right to travel upon the public highway by automobile in the 
    ordinary course of life and business. It can therefore be concluded that 
    this regulation does involve a Constitutional Right. </P>
    <P>The third question is the most important in this case. "Is this 
    regulation reasonable?" </P>
    <P>The answer is No! It will be shown later in "Regulation," infra., that 
    this licensing statute is oppressive and could be effectively administered 
    by less oppressive means. </P>
    <P>Although the Fourteenth Amendment does not interfere with the proper 
    exercise of the police power, in accordance with the general principle that 
    the power must be exercised so as not to invade unreasonably the rights 
    guaranteed by the United States Constitution, it is established beyond 
    question that every state power, including the police power, is limited by 
    the Fourteenth Amendment (and others) and by the inhibitions there imposed. 
    </P>
    <P>Moreover, the ultimate test of the propriety of police power regulations 
    must be found in the Fourteenth Amendment, since it operates to limit the 
    field of the police power to the extent of preventing the enforcement of 
    statutes in denial of Rights that the Amendment protects. (See <I>Parks vs. 
    State</I>, 64 NE 682.) </P>

    <P>As has been shown, the courts at all levels have firmly established an

      357 US 116 (1958). </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>The focal point of this question of police power and due process must 
    balance upon the point of making the public highways a safe place for the 
    public to travel. If a man travels in a manner that creates actual damage, 
    an action would lie (civilly) for recovery of damages. The state could then 
    also proceed against the individual to deprive him of his Right to use the 
    public highways, for cause. This process would fulfill the due process 
    requirements of the Fifth Amendment while at the same time insuring that 
    Rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the state constitutions would 
    be protected. </P>
    <P>But unless or until harm or damage (a crime) is committed, there is no 
    cause for interference in the private affairs or actions of a Citizen. </P>
    <P>One of the most famous and perhaps the most quoted definitions of due 
    process of law, is that of Daniel Webster in his Dartmouth College Case (4 
    Wheat 518), in which he declared that by due process is meant "a law which 
    hears before it condemns, which proceeds upon inquiry, and renders judgment 
    only after trial." (See also <I>State vs. Strasburg</I>, 110 P. 1020; 
    <I>Dennis vs. Moses</I>, 52 P. 333.) </P>
    <P>Somewhat similar is the statement that is a rule as old as the law that 
    "no one shall be personally bound (restricted) until he has had his day in 
    court," by which is meant, until he has been duly cited to appear and has 
    been afforded an opportunity to be heard. Judgment without such citation and 
    opportunity lacks all the attributes of a judicial determination; it is 
    judicial usurpation and it is oppressive and can never be upheld where it is 
    fairly administered. (12 Am.Jur. [1st] Const. Law, Sect.573, p.269.) </P>
    <P>Note: This sounds like the process used to deprive one of the "privilege" 
    of operating a motor vehicle "for hire." It should be kept in mind, however, 
    that we are discussing the arbitrary deprivation of the Right to use the 
    road that all citizens have "in common." </P>
    <P>The futility of the state's position can be most easily observed in the 
    1959 Washington Attorney General's opinion on a similar issue: </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"The distinction between the Right of the Citizen to use the 
      public highways for private, rather than commercial purposes is 
      recognized..."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>and... </P>
    <P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Under its power to regulate private uses of our highways, our 
      legislature has required that motor vehicle operators be licensed (I.C. 
      49-307). Undoubtedly, the primary purpose of this requirement is to 
      insure, as far as possible, that all motor vehicle operators will be 
      competent and qualified, thereby reducing the potential hazard or risk of 
      harm, to which other users of the highways might otherwise be subject. But 
      once having complied with this regulatory provision, by obtaining the 
      required license, a motorist enjoys the privilege of travelling freely 
      upon the highways..."; Washington A.G.O. 59-60 No. 88, p. 11.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>This alarming opinion appears to be saying that every person using an 
    automobile as a matter of Right, must give up the Right and convert the 
    Right into a privilege. This is accomplished under the guise of regulation. 
    This statement is indicative of the insensitivity, even the ignorance, of 
    the government to the limits placed upon governments by and through the 
    several constitutions. </P>
    <P>This legal theory may have been able to stand in 1959; however, as of 
    1966, in the United States Supreme Court decision in Miranda, even this weak 
    defense of the state's actions must fall. </P>

    defined as applying only to those who are "conducting business in the 
    streets" or "operating for-hire vehicles." </P>
    <P>The legislature has attempted, by legislative fiat, to deprive the 
    Citizen of his Right to use the roads in the ordinary course of life and

      Massachusetts</I>, 167 US 43; <I>Pachard vs. Banton</I>, supra.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P></P>
    <P>One can say for certain that these regulations are impartial since they 
    are being applied to all, even though they are clearly beyond the limits of 
    the legislative powers. However, we must consider whether such regulations 
    are reasonable and non-violative of constitutional guarantees. </P>
    <P>First, let us consider the reasonableness of this statute requiring all 
    persons to be licensed (presuming that we are applying this statute to all 
    persons using the public roads). In determining the reasonableness of the 
    statute we need only ask two questions: </P>
    <P><B>1. Does the statute accomplish its stated goal?</B> </P>
    <P>The answer is No! </P>
    <P>The attempted explanation for this regulation "to insure the safety of 
    the public by insuring, as much as possible, that all are competent and 
    qualified." </P>
    <P>However, one can keep his license without retesting, from the time he/she 
    is first licensed until the day he/she dies, without regard to the 
    competency of the person, by merely renewing said license before it expires. 
    It is therefore possible to completely skirt the goal of this attempted 
    regulation, thus proving that this regulation does not accomplish its goal. 
    </P>
    <P>Furthermore, by testing and licensing, the state gives the appearance of 
    underwriting the competence of the licensees, and could therefore be held 
    liable for failures, accidents, etc. caused by licensees. </P>
    <P><B>2. Is the statute reasonable?</B> </P>
    <P>The answer is No! </P>
    <P>This statute cannot be determined to be reasonable since it requires to 
    the Citizen to give up his or her natural Right to travel unrestricted in 
    order to accept the privilege. The purported goal of this statute could be 
    met by much less oppressive regulations, i.e., competency tests and 
    certificates of competency before using an automobile upon the public roads. 
    (This is exactly the situation in the aviation sector.) </P>
    <P>But isn't this what we have now? </P>
    <P>The answer is No! The real purpose of this license is much more 
    insidious. When one signs the license, he/she gives up his/her 
    Constitutional Right to travel in order to accept and exercise a privilege. 
    After signing the license, a quasi-contract, the Citizen has to give the 
    state his/her consent to be prosecuted for constructive crimes and 
    quasi-criminal actions where there is no harm done and no damaged property. 
    </P>
    <P>These prosecutions take place without affording the Citizen of their 
    Constitutional Rights and guarantees such a the Right to a trial by jury of 
    twelve persons and the Right to counsel, as well as the normal safeguards 
    such as proof of intent and a corpus dilecti and a grand jury indictment. 
    These unconstitutional prosecutions take place because the Citizen is 
    exercising a privilege and has given his/her "implied consent" to 
    legislative enactments designed to control interstate commerce, a 
    regulatable enterprise under the police power of the state. </P>
    <P>We must now conclude that the Citizen is forced to give up Constitutional 
    guarantees of "Right" in order to exercise his state "privilege" to travel 
    upon the public highways in the ordinary course of life and business. </P>

    <P></P>
    <P>As previously demonstrated, the Citizen has the Right to travel and to 
    transport his property upon the public highways in the ordinary course of 
    life and business. However, if one exercises this Right to travel (without 
    first giving up the Right and converting that Right into a privilege) the

    <P>Any person who claims his Right to travel upon the highways, and so 
    exercises that Right, cannot be tried for a crime of doing so. And yet, this

    exercising his Right to Liberty. </P>
    <P>As we have already shown, the term "drive" can only apply to those who 
    are employed in the business of transportation for hire. It has been shown

    <P>The courts are "duty bound" to recognize and stop the "stealthy

    in an unconstitutional manner upon those Free and Natural individuals who 
    have a Right to travel upon the highways. </P>
    <P>This was not attempted in an outright action, but in a slow, meticulous, 
    calculated encroachment upon the Citizen's Right to travel. </P>
    <P>This position must be accepted unless the prosecutor can show his 
    authority for the position that the "use of the road in the ordinary course 
    of life and business" is a privilege. </P>
    <P>To rule in any other manner, without clear authority for an adverse 
    ruling, will infringe upon fundamental and basic concepts of Constitutional 
    law. This position, that a Right cannot be regulated under any guise, must 
    be accepted without concern for the monetary loss of the state. </P>

    <P></P>
    <P>Therefore, the Court's decision in the instant case must be made without 
    the issue of cost to the state being taken into consideration, as that issue 
    is irrelevant. The state cannot lose money that it never had a right to 
    demand from the "Sovereign People." </P>
    <P>Finally, we come to the issue of "public policy." It could be argued that 
    the "licensing scheme" of all persons is a matter of "public policy." 
    However, if this argument is used, it too must fail, as: </P>

    RULED THAT AMERICAN CITIZENS <BR>HAVE A RIGHT TO TRAVEL WITHOUT STATE 
    PERMITS </FONT></B><BR>By Jack McLamb, Ret. Phoenix Officer</DIV>
    <P></P>
    <P>For years professionals within the criminal justice system have acted on 
    the belief that traveling by motor vehicle was a "privilege" that was given 
    to a citizen only after approval by their state government in the form of a 
    permit or license to drive. In other words, the individual must be granted 
    the privilege before his use of the state highways was considered legal. 
</P>
    <P>Legislators, police officers, and court officials are becoming aware that 
    there are court decisions that disprove the belief that driving is a 
    privilege and therefore requires government approval in the form of a 
    license. Presented here are some of these cases: </P>
    <P>CASE #1: "The use of the highway for the purpose of travel and 
    transportation is not a mere privilege, but a common fundamental right of 
    which the public and individuals cannot rightfully be deprived." - 
    <I>Chicago Motor Coach v. Chicago</I>, 169 NE 221. </P>
    <P>CASE #2: "The right of the citizen to travel upon the public highways and 
    to transport his property thereon, either by carriage or by automobile, is 
    not a mere privilege which a city may prohibit or permit at will, but a 
    common law right which he has under the right to life, liberty, and the 
    pursuit of happiness." <I>Thompson v. Smith,</I> 154 SE 579. </P>
    <P>It could not be stated more directly or conclusively that citizens of the 
    states have a common law right to travel, without approval or restriction 
    (license), and that this right is protected under the U.S Constitution. </P>
    <P>"The right to travel is a part of the liberty of which the citizen cannot 
    be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment." <I>Kent 
    v. Dulles </I>(1958) 357 US 116, 125. </P>
    <P>"The right to travel is a well-established common right that does not owe 
    its existence to the federal government. It is recognized by the courts as a 
    natural right." - <I>Schactman v. Dulles</I> 96 App DC 287, 225 F2d 938, at 
    941. </P>
    <P>As hard as it is for those of us in law enforcement to believe, there is 
    no room for speculation in these court decisions. American citizens do 
    indeed have the inalienable right to use the roadways unrestricted in any 
    manner as long as they are not damaging or violating property or rights of 
    others. </P>
    <P>Government -- in requiring the people to obtain drivers licenses, and 
    accepting vehicle inspections and DUI/DWI roadblocks without question -- is 
    restricting, and therefore violating, the people's common law right to 
    travel. </P>
    <P>Is this a new legal interpretation on this subject? Apparently not. This 
    means that the beliefs and opinions our state legislators, the courts, and 
    those in law enforcement have acted upon for years have been in error. 
    Researchers armed with actual facts state that case law is overwhelming in 
    determining that to restrict the movement of the individual in the free 
    exercise of his right to travel is a serious breach of those freedoms 
    secured by the U.S. Constitution and most state constitutions. That means 
    that the encroachment by means of licensing and roadblocks is unlawful. </P>
    <P>The revelation that the American citizen has always had the inalienable 
    right to travel raises profound questions for those who are involved in 
    making and enforcing state laws. </P>
    <P>The first of such questions may very well be this: If the states have 
    been enforcing laws that are unconstitutional on their face, it would seem 
    that there must be some way that a state can legally put restrictions -- 
    such as licensing requirements, mandatory insurance, vehicle registration, 
    vehicle inspections to name just a few -- on a citizen's constitutionally 
    protected rights. Is that so? </P>
    <P>For the answer, let us look, once again, to the U.S. courts for a 
    determination of this very issue. </P>
    <P>In <I>Hurtado v. California</I> (1884) 110 US 516, the U.S. Supreme Court 
    states very plainly: "The state cannot diminish rights of the people." </P>
    <P>And in <I>Bennett v. Boggs</I>, 1 Baldw 60, "Statutes that violate the 
    plain and obvious principles of common right and common reason are null and 
    void." </P>
    <P>Would we not say that these judicial decisions are straight to the 
    point-- that there is no lawful method for government to put restrictions or 
    limitations on rights belonging to the people? </P>
    <P>Other cases are even more straight forward: </P>
    <P>"The assertion of federal rights, when plainly and reasonably made, is 
    not to be defeated under the name of local practice." <I>Davis v. 
    Wechsler</I>, 263 US 22, at 24. </P>
    <P>"Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no 
    rule making or legislation which would abrogate them." <I>Miranda v. 
    Arizona</I>, (1966) 384 US 436, 491. </P>
    <P>"The claim and exercise of a constitutional right cannot be converted 
    into a crime." <I>Miller v. US</I>, 230 F 486, at 489. </P>
    <P>"There can be no sanction or penalty imposed upon one because of this 
    exercise of constitutional rights." <I>Sherer v. Cullen</I>, 481 F 946. </P>
    <P>We could go on, quoting court decision after court decision; however, the 
    Constitution itself answers our question - Can a government legally put 
    restrictions on the Rights of the American people at anytime, for any 
    reason? The answer is found in Article Six of the U.S. Constitution: </P>
    <P><B>"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be 
    made in Pursuance thereof;...shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the 
    Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution 
    or laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding."</B> - Supremacy 
    clause. </P>
    <P>In the same Article, it says just who within our government that is bound 
    by this Supreme Law: </P>
    <P><B>"The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of 
    the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, 
    both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath 
    or Affirmation, to support this Constitution..."</B> </P>
    <P>Here's an interesting question. Is ignorance of these laws an excuse for 
    such acts by officials? </P>
    <P>If we are to follow the letter of the law, (as we are sworn to do), this 
    places officials who involve themselves in such unlawful acts in an 
    unfavorable legal situation. <B>For it is a felony and federal crime to 
    violate or deprive citizens of their constitutionally protected rights.</B> 
    Our system of law dictates that there are only two ways to legally remove a 
    right belonging to the people. </P>
    <P>These are (1) by lawfully amending the constitution, or (2) by a person 
    knowingly waiving a particular right. </P>
    <P>Some of the confusion on our present system has arisen because many 
    millions of people have waived their right to travel unrestricted and 
    volunteered into the jurisdiction of the state. Those who have knowingly 
    given up these rights are now legally regulated by state law and must 
    acquire the proper permits and registrations. </P>
    <P>There are basically two groups of people in this category: </P>
    <P>(1) Citizens who involve themselves in commerce upon the highways of the 
    state. </P>
    <P>Here is what the courts have said about this: </P>
    <P>"...For while a citizen has the right to travel upon the public highways 
    and to transport his property thereon, that right does not extend to the use 
    of the highways...as a place for private gain. For the latter purpose, no 
    person has a vested right to use the highways of this state, but it is a 
    privilege...which the (state) may grant or withhold at its discretion..." 
    <I>State v. Johnson</I>, 245 P 1073. </P>
    <P>There are many court cases that confirm and point out the difference 
    between the Right of the citizen to travel and a government privilege and 
    there are numerous other court decisions that spell out the jurisdiction 
    issue in these two distinctly different activities. However, because of 
    space restrictions, we will leave it to officers to research it further for 
    themselves. </P>
    <P>(2) The second group of citizens that is legally under the jurisdiction 
    of the state are those citizens who have voluntarily and knowingly waived 
    their right to travel unregulated and unrestricted by requesting placement 
    under such jurisdiction through the acquisition of a state driver's license, 
    vehicle registration, mandatory insurance, etc. (In other words, by 
    contract.) </P>
    <P>We should remember what makes this legal and not a violation of the 
    common law right to travel is that they knowingly volunteer by contract to 
    waive their rights. If they were forced, coerced or unknowingly placed under 
    the state's powers, the courts have said it is a clear violation of their 
    rights. </P>
    <P>This in itself raises a very interesting question. <B>What percentage of 
    the people in each state have applied for and received licenses, 
    registrations and obtained insurance after erroneously being advised by 
    their government that it was mandatory?</B> </P>
    <P>Many of our courts, attorneys and police officials are just becoming 
    informed about this important issue and the difference between privileges 
    and Rights. </P>
    <P>We can assume that the majority of those Americans carrying state 
    licenses and vehicle registrations have no knowledge of the rights they 
    waived in obeying laws such as these that the <B>U.S. Constitution clearly 
    states are unlawful, i.e. laws of no effect – laws that are not laws at 
    all.</B> </P>
    <P>An area of serious consideration for every police officer is to 
    understand that the most important law in our land which he has taken an 
    oath to protect, defend, and enforce, is not state laws and city or county 
    ordinances, but the law that supercedes all other laws -- <B>the U.S. 
    Constitution.</B> If laws in a particular state or local community conflict 
    with the supreme law of our nation, there is no question that the officer's 
    duty is to uphold the U.S. Constitution. </P>
    <P>Every police officer should keep the following U.S. court ruling -- 
    discussed earlier -- in mind before issuing citations concerning licensing, 
    registration, and insurance: </P>
    <P><B>"The claim and exercise of a constitutional [protected] right cannot 
    be converted into a crime."</B> <I>Miller v. US</I>, 230 F 486, 489. </P>
    <P>And as we have seen, traveling freely, going about one's daily 
    activities, is the exercise of a most basic Right.
