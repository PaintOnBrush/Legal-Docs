            <H2>Citizenship</H2></CENTER>
            <P>As Americans, we are socialized to believe that we are all 
            Citizens of this great nation we call the United States of America.  
            Quite frankly, most Americans are pretty emotional about the issue.  
            Try telling your neighbor, who fought against Hitler in WWII, that 
            he's not a citizen of the United States, and see what reaction you 
            get! 
            <P>The problem is that the people who write laws don't write them in 
            the same manner that you and I speak.  [See the section on "legal 
            terms" within <A href="http://www.originalintent.org/edu/thelaw.php#terms">The 
            Law</A> page on this site.]  Laws are written to achieve certain 
            goals and the words used within laws are selected to achieve those 
            goals.  Sometimes the goals are legitimate and the language that is 
            used, while confusing at times, is necessary to achieve the goal. 
            Other times confusing language is used for no other reason than to 
            obscure the truth from the casual reader.   
            <P>The issue of citizenship is no less clouded by such use of 
            language than is any other area of law.  The definitions of words or 
            "legal terms" must be sought out diligently and the context in which 
            they are used always carefully considered.  [See <A href="http://www.originalintent.org/edu/thelaw.php">The 
            Law</A> for information on "words" v. "legal terms" and issues of 
            "context".] 
            <P>In the Constitution of the United States, the phrase "Citizen of 
            the United States" appears.  Because this phrase appears within a 
            Constitution, not a statute, the meaning of the phrase is determined 
            by the meaning intended by those who wrote and signed the 
            Constitution.  If the intended meaning is manifest, there is no 
            power on earth, including that of a criminal in a black robe, which 
            can alter the meaning of the phrase.  The meaning of the phrase 
            "Citizen of the United States" is well understood.  That phrase is 
            shorthand for the sentence, "All the Citizens of the 13 independent 
            nations [called "states"] that are a party to this Constitution".  
            The important element that you should understand is that the 
            "Citizen of the United States" spoken of in the Constitution of the 
            United States is more properly and accurately a Citizen of the state 
            in which he lives.  The phrase "Citizen of the United States" is 
            actually a euphemism used for convenience and brevity, and not a 
            legal title. 
            <P>After the Constitution was signed by all the states, the federal 
            government began acquiring "territories".  At the time, these 
            territories were limited to the lands west of the established 
            boundaries of the states, and lands not claimed by the states.  
            People born in those federally held territories, by parents who were 
            not Citizens of a state, became de facto "citizens of the United 
            States".  Although at that time there was no statutory authority for 
            such a thing, international law had (and still has) a long 
            established doctrine that, absent any extenuating circumstances, a 
            person is a citizen of the national jurisdiction (or sovereignty) in 
            which he's born.   The federal territories were outside of the 
            sovereignty of the individual state governments, and within the 
            sovereignty of the United States government; hence the de facto 
            status as a "citizen of the United States".  This principle also 
            applies to persons in Washington DC, which is under the exclusive 
            sovereignty of the United States.  [For the sake of clarity, we use 
            a lower case "c" for a citizen of the federal government and an 
            upper case "C" to denote a Citizen of a state of the Union.]  It 
            should be noted that "citizens of the United States" are <U>not</U> 
            <B>The People</B> who created the states, then by state action, 
            created the federal government.  These "federal citizens" are not 
            "parties to the Constitution" and therefore did not have legal claim 
            to the same rights, privileges, and immunities that state Citizens 
            did.   
            <P>One should take careful note that the Citizens of the states of 
            the Union are the <EM>only</EM> Citizens who possess all the rights, 
            privileges, and immunities spoken of in the US Constitution, plus 
            whatever additional rights are secured to them by their own state 
            Constitutions.  At the end of this section you will see federal and 
            state court cases that clearly show that the rights of one class of 
            Citizen are thoroughly different from the "rights" (actually 
            Congressionally granted privileges) of the other class of citizen. 
            This distinction in the "class of citizenship" continued without 
            significant comment or concern until the end of the Civil War. 
            <P>Although the Civil War was not fought over slavery (despite what 
            you were taught in the public schools), the end of the Civil War 
            nevertheless brought about the end of involuntary servitude and 
            slavery in America. [See Article XIII of the Constitution of the 
            United States.] 
            <P>Prior to the Civil War, the southern states did not recognize 
            blacks as persons who could become Citizens of their states.  In 
            fact it was well understood by the Citizens of these southern states 
            that when their state Constitutions protected the right to own 
            "property" or "chattel", that right included holding slaves.  That 
            was exactly what the framers of these southern Constitutions had 
            intended and so that understanding was accurate and factual. 
            <P>After the South lost the rebellion, the United States took the 
            opportunity to free the slaves.  This was easier said than done 
            because the Constitutions of the Southern states hadn't changed a 
            bit just because the South had lost the War.  Their Constitutions 
            still did not recognize blacks as persons who could attain 
            citizenship. 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE><EM>"Prior to the adoption of the federal 
              Constitution, states possessed unlimited and unrestricted 
              sovereignty and retained the same even afterward…except as such 
              was surrendered to the federal government or they were expressly 
              prohibited from exercising by the United States 
              Constitution."</EM><BR><U>Blair v Ridgely</U>, 97 D. 218, 249, 
              S.P. <U>People v. Coleman</U>, 60 D. 581</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>Congress was faced with a difficult dilemma; it wanted the freed 
            blacks to become Citizens, but there was nothing in the US 
            Constitution that gave Congress the power to alter the Constitutions 
            of the Southern states.  The best Congress could do in an immediate 
            sense was to consider the South under "military occupation" of the 
            United States (which it was) and recognize that as such, the 
            Southern states came within the authority of Article I, Section 8, 
            Clause 17 of the US Constitution.  [See <A href="http://www.originalintent.org/edu/territory.php">US 
            Territorial Authority</A> in this site.]  What this meant was that 
            as long as the Southern states were held as a "defeated foe" 
            Congress could pass legislation that would operate within the area 
            known as "the Southern states".  However, in the future, when 
            Congress would restored the Southern states to their former status 
            as regular states of the Union, all such federal legislation would 
            cease to operate in the Southern states.  This meant that Congress 
            needed a two-phase solution.  The first phase being the enactment of 
            federal laws to operate within the "occupied territories" and the 
            second phase being a Constitutional amendment to secure the 
            principles of those laws even after the laws themselves lost 
            authority in the Southern states.  
            <P>It should be noted at this point that although the slaves were 
            now free, and had been born in a state of the Union, they still were 
            not Citizens of that state.  In short, they had no citizenship at 
            all.  Under long established doctrines of law, a person who is not a 
            citizen of a place in which he resides is an alien.  The legal 
            position of the freed slaves was tenuous - yes, they were free, but 
            they were aliens in the land of their birth and were thus not 
            entitled to the same rights, privileges, and immunities as Citizens. 
             Although defeated in battle, the people of the South were not yet 
            ready to capitulate on the slavery issue and they moved quickly to 
            use the "alien" status of the blacks against them.  Almost 
            immediately after the surrender of the Confederacy, many Southern 
            states started enacting "Black Codes".  These laws were intended to 
            operate only upon "persons not citizens" (a phrase right out of Dred 
            Scott v. Sanford, 19 How. 393), and thus effectively limit the new 
            found freedom enjoyed by the former slaves by requiring them to 
            apply for licenses to do anything from holding a job, to hunting for 
            food.   
            <P>Because the Southern states were under the "exclusive legislative 
            jurisdiction" of Congress at this time, any state or local laws that 
            conflicted with federal law would immediately become void and 
            unenforceable.  Congress moved quickly to quash the Black Codes.  In 
            rapid succession Congress passed the Enforcement Act, the Freedman's 
            Bureau Act, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866.  Collectively, these 
            acts prevented the enforcement of the Black Codes and simultaneously 
            imbued the freed black slaves with federally granted privileges that 
            are euphemistically called "rights".  It is in the Enforcement Act 
            that we first see the phrase "citizen of the United States" used as 
            a "legal term" embracing <EM><B>only</B></EM> the recently freed 
            black slaves.  This term is then used again in the both the 
            Freedman's Bureau Act, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 in the same 
            limited manner.  It should be noted at this point that the phrase 
            "citizen of the United States" had been used for nearly 8 decades 
            before the Civil War, but always to speak of persons within federal 
            territories.  This was the first time that Congress had used the 
            phrase to denote a person who had been born within a state of the 
            Union.  Congress could only apply the term in this way, within 
            federal law, at that specific point in history because the South 
            (where the freed blacks lived) was "federal territory" as long as it 
            was being held by the United States military as a "defeated foe". 
            <P>Phase two of Congress' plan was put into action with the drafting 
            of the 14th Amendment.  Here are its pertinent parts to this 
            discussion: 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Section 1.</B> All persons born or naturalized in 
              the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are 
              citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they 
              reside.  No State shall make or enforce any law which shall 
              abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United 
              States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, 
              or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person 
              within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the 
            laws.</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Section 2.</B> Representatives shall be apportioned 
              among the several States according to their respective numbers, 
              counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding 
              Indians not taxed.  But when the right to vote at any election for 
              the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the 
              United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and 
              Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature 
              thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, 
              being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, 
              or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or 
              other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced 
              in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall 
              bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age 
              in such State.</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>In drafting the Amendment, Congress was looking to make its 
            federal laws (the Enforcement Act, the Freedman's Bureau Act, and 
            the Civil Rights Act of 1866) a part of the US Constitution.  In 
            doing so they intended to ensure that the freed blacks would have 
            certain privileges and protections remain in place after the United 
            States pulled its army out of the South and restored the Southern 
            states to their previous status as states of the Union.  The 
            Amendment would also insure that Congress had the national authority 
            to enforce the provisions of the Amendment upon any state that 
            attempted to violate them. 
            <P>Because the Congressional Acts were merely intended to "hold the 
            line" until the 14th Amendment was ratified, their intent is 
            significant in determining the intent of the 14th Amendment.

              as is enjoyed by white citizens."</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>Please note that when the drafters of this bill meant to indicate 
            a Citizen, they clearly used the word "citizen", however when 
            defining "who" the Act applies to, the drafters used the word 
            "person".  As they used both words within the same paragraph, it is 
            obvious that the drafters were keenly aware of the distinction. 
            <P>Clearly Congressional intent was to provide non-citizens with the 
            same fundamental rights as de jure state Citizens (who in that day, 
            were exclusively white).  This intent was further clarified in 
            President Johnson's speech when he vetoed that bill.  President 
            Johnson made this statement as part of his speech:

              blacks, persons of color, Negroes, mulattoes and persons of 
              African blood.  Every individual of those races born in the United

            <P>Once again, it can clearly be seen that the intent of the this 
            Act was to embrace "persons" (as defined in Dred Scott case), but in 
            no way was intended to address or alter the relationship of the de 
            jure white Citizen to his state of birth or domicile. 
            <P>In the case of <EM>United States v. Otherson</EM>, the US Supreme 
            Court found it necessary to review the historical foundations of the 
            Enforcement Act.  The Court found that Senator Stewart, who had 
            sponsored the Enforcement Act legislation, had made the following 
            remarks regarding the Act's intent.  Stewart noted that the bill,  
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>"...simply extends to foreigners, not citizens, the 
              protections of our laws".</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>He also added that, 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>"This bill extends [the equal protection of laws] to 
              aliens, so that all persons who are in the United States shall

            <P>These realities were not lost upon the various courts that were 
            later called upon to make determinations as to the intent of the 
            various civil rights acts or the 14th Amendment.  In <EM><U>Van 
            Valkenburg v. Brown</U></EM>, 43 Cal Sup Ct. 43, the Court made the

            Constitution."</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>As we are now repeatedly drawing a distinction between blacks and 
            whites, this is probably a good point to stop and address the topic 
            of racism as it relates to this article.  This is a historical 
            examination of the law as it existed in the various states and the 
            United States prior to, and after, the Civil War, and how the 
            foundations laid down in those laws and court decisions may still 
            affect our lives today.  This article is not intended to critique or 
            pass judgment upon the moral correctness (or lack thereof) of the 
            laws which existed at that time, or upon the decisions of the US 
            Supreme Court in reference to slavery, the Civil War, the various 
            Civil Rights Acts, or the 14th Amendment.  It is merely a history 
            lesson with certain inevitable conclusions drawn at the end.  Please 
            do not impute any bias, in either direction, to Original Intent.  
            Having said that, let's carry on. 
            <P>As we have examined, courts in the latter part of the 19th 
            century were quite clear on the intended purpose of the Freedman's 
            Bureau Act, the Enforcement Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and 
            the 14th Amendment.  However, what has the Supreme Court said in 
            this century? 
            <P>In <EM>Hurd v. Hodge</EM> (1948), the court explained that in 
            order to understand the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>"...reference must be made to the scope and purpose of 
              the 14th Amendment; for that statute and the Amendment were 
              closely related both in inception and in objectives which Congress 
              sought to achieve".</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>The Court further stated that the purpose of the 14th Amendment, 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>"was to incorporate the guaranties of the Civil Rights 
              Act of 1866 in the organic law of the land".</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>The "original intent" link can also be found in several other 
            cases as well.  Justice Harlan noted that privileges and immunities 
            protected by the 14 Amendment included [used in its restrictive 
            sense] those set forth in the first section of the Civil Rights Act. 
             Justice Thurgood Marshall noted that, 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>"the Congress that passed the 14th Amendment is the 
              same Congress that passed the 1866 Freedman's Bureau 
            Act",</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>and he concluded that the rights set forth in the Freedman's 
            Bureau Act were dispositive of Congress' intent in the 14th 
            Amendment.  
            <P>In 1987, Justice William Brennan traced the "rights" [actually 
            congressionally granted "privileges"] that are secured by the 14th 
            Amendment to the Freedman's Bureau bill.  He then went on to state 
            that, 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>"The main target of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 were 
              the 'black codes' enacted in the Southern States..."</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>As can be readily seen, even relatively recent Courts have 
            acknowledged the fact that the 14th Amendment was simply intended to 
            integrate elements of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the 
            Freedman's Bureau Act into the Constitutional structure of the 
            nation.  Accordingly, the 14th Amendment only applies to 
            non-citizens (aliens) who were the exclusive focus of the Civil 
            Rights Act of 1866 and the Freedman's Bureau Act. 
            <P>Now that the intent, meaning, and proper application of the 14th 
            Amendment have been illustrated, it is clear that the Amendment made 
            "federal citizens" out of specific aliens who otherwise would have 
            had no form of citizenship at all.  By converting these "aliens" 
            into "federal citizens", they fell under the protection of the 
            federal government with regard to those "rights" that had been 
            conferred upon them by the 14th Amendment. 
            <P>In consideration of these facts, Black's Law Dictionary (6th Ed.) 
            defines the 14th Amendment this way: 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the 
              United States, ratified in 1868, creates or at least recognizes 
              for the first time a citizenship of the United States, as distinct 
              from that of the states;...</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>Note the vagueness in the definition - "...creates or at least 
            recognizes for the first time...".  This vagueness is because 
            Congressional intent purported to embrace only the recently freed 
            slaves, but at the same time, the bare language of the Amendment, 
            (without consideration of Congressional intent) seems to merely 
            recognize the long standing principle that the federal government 
            has its own citizens, who are not state Citizens; a legal reality 
            that existed long before the 14th Amendment.  
            <P>We have covered a lot of ground in this piece and it is important 
            to note that with all of the evidence that is available, it has 
            never once been asserted by any member of Congress, or by the 
            courts, that the 14th Amendment, or the phrase "citizen of the 
            United States" as used before the ratification of the 14th 
            Amendment, applies to native born Citizens of a state of the Union.  
            It should also be noted that the original use and application of the 
            phrase "citizen of the United States" still continues today, 
            unaffected by the 14th Amendment, which embraced only a very narrow 
            and specific group of persons. 
            <P>To summarize the points that we have touched upon thus far: 
            <P>
            <OL>
              <LI>There is an original Citizen of a state of the Union. 
              <LI>There is a "citizen of the United States" as that phrase has 
              always been used. 
              <LI>There is a "citizen of the United States" as that term is used 
              in the 14th Amendment. </LI></OL>
            <P>At this juncture one might rightly ask what the practical 
            distinctions are in the three forms of citizenship.  Before we move 
            forward with that, we should observe that the 14th Amendment merely 
            constitutionalized the concepts by which the United States had been 
            operating for decades under the doctrine of international law, 
            defining the derivation of citizenship.  What made the 14th 
            Amendment necessary was that for the first time the federal 
            government intended to grant federal citizenship to persons born 
            within a state of a Union. 
            <P>
            <H3>Rights of Citizens of the states of the Union</H3>
            <P>The Declaration of Independence states that, "all men are created 
            equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain 
            unalienable Rights…"  This clearly lays out the foundation of our 
            rights - we are all equal before God, and the law; we possess rights 
            which are "unalienable"; those rights are given to us by God (our 
            Creator).  Although the men who wrote the Declaration of 
            Independence said that "all men" are created equal, when it came 
            time to create the legal framework of a government, they understood 
            that they could not include "all men" in a Constitution, but could 
            only speak of those people who had formed the states, which then 
            resulted in the states creating a national government of limited 
            power.  It is the state Citizens to whom the phrase "all men" would 
            have to be limited for governmental purposes. Accordingly, as the 
            form of our governments began to take shape, the people who would be 
            able to claim these, "unalienable rights", which the "Creator" 
            granted, would only be the Citizens of the states.  While this may 
            seem like a narrow restriction, one must remember that a government 
            can only make laws (including its Constitution) for its own "body 
            politic", and no one else. 
            <P>So what are these mysterious "unalienable rights"?  The 
            Declaration of Independence says that, "among these [rights] are 
            Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness".  While "Life, Liberty 
            and the pursuit of Happiness" is pretty all encompassing, the words 
            of the Framers tell us that there are more rights involved, and that 
            "among them" are found the rights of "Life, Liberty and the pursuit 
            of Happiness".  In other words, the language of the Framers tells us 
            that "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness" is a designated 
            group of rights within a larger body of rights referred to as our 
            "unalienable rights". 
            <P>This larger body of "unalienable rights" is vast.  In fact, it is 
            so vast that no one, not even the judicial branch, has ever 
            attempted to list the rights contained therein.  This is best 
            illustrated by the old adage that, "My right to swing my fist ends 
            somewhere before it hits your nose".  In short, a Citizen can do 
            virtually anything he or she wants, so long as it does not infringe 
            on the rights of another Citizen, or endanger the community.  Also 
            inclusive in these rights are your protections against mistreatment 
            by government; the primary protections being expressly stated in the 
            Bill of Rights in the US Constitution. 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>"You have rights antecedent to all earthly 
              governments; rights that cannot be repealed or restrained by human

              <P> -- John Adams, Second President of the United States. 
              (1792-1801)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>The US Supreme Court has stated that because these rights existed 
            antecedent [prior to] the formation of either the states or the 
            national government they are outside the government's power to 
            alter, modify, or abolish.  How's that for some strong protection!   
            <P>With these powerful rights in our hands, one might wonder what 
            sort of "rights" are possessed by "citizens of the United States". 
            <P>
            <H3>The Poor Stepchild "citizen"</H3>
            <P>If the Citizens of the states of the Union have their 
            "unalienable rights", what then do "citizens of the United States" 
            have?  Frankly, not much of value.  For the balance of this section, 
            we will use the term "federal citizen" to denote a "citizen of the 
            United States".   
            <P>A federal citizen has only those rights that have been granted to 
            him by Congress by way of the numerous and various civil rights 
            acts, and such rights as may have been invested in him by an 
            activist US Supreme Court that felt it could legislate from the 
            bench. 
            <P>Let's be clear - the "rights" of federal citizens are not given 
            to them by God, as are our unalienable rights.  Their rights are 
            given to them by Congress alone, and the most significant point to 
            understand and keep in mind is that, "What Congress giveth, Congress 
            may taketh away".  It has always been this way and it will always be 
            this way.  The only thing that may be surprising in all of this is 
            that this is the first time you're hearing it!  Most Americans have 
            no idea that there are two "classes of citizenship", nor do they 
            understand the vast distinction between the two, and what it means 
            in their lives. 
            <P>Let's look at what the courts have said about federal 
            citizenship: 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>"A 'civil right' is considered a right given and

              subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the

              Wilkins</EM>, 112 US 94, 101, 102 (1884) </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>While <EM>Elk v. Wilkins</EM> is a 14th Amendment case, the 
            concept is still true concerning all federal citizens.  In other 
            words, all federal citizens must be, by their very definition, a 
            person who is "completely subject" to the jurisdiction of the 
            federal government (such as a citizen of Washington DC).  Virtually 
            any legal concept stated by the courts concerning a 14th Amendment 
            citizen is operative upon all federal citizens. 
            <P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>"The privileges and immunities clause of the 14th 
              Amendment protects very few rights because it neither incorporates

              (See Slaughter House cases, 83 US (16 Wall.) 36, 21 L. Ed. 394 
              (1873)).  Instead this provision protects only those rights 
              peculiar to being a citizen of the federal government; it does not

            <P> It should be noted that many of the rights not attributed to 
            federal citizens in the cases above have since been granted to them 
            either by Congress or by the courts.  These early decisions simply 
            clarify and solidify the reality that federal citizens are not the 
            same "class of citizen" as state Citizens.  
            <P>Like so many areas in which the federal government has tread, it 
            has unbalanced the equation.  Where at one time there was no real 
            problem with there being different classes of citizenship, with the 
            ratification of the 14th Amendment, Congress went into overdrive 
            with civil rights legislation.  The result was a labyrinth of 
            "rights" and protections for federal citizens.  Some of these have 
            even found their way into additional Constitutional amendments.  
            Because the state Citizen is a member of <B>The People</B>; the 
            people in whom the sovereignty of the states, and by association, 
            the national government resides, such a Citizen is left to protect 
            his own rights, with no special process to help him accomplish that 
            end.  In short, he must defend his rights with all his will, his 
            energy, his money, and passion in the courts for as long as it takes 
            to reach a final outcome. </P></FONT>

             Conversely, the federal citizen need only lodge a complaint with 
            the appropriate federal agency and the power of the federal 
            government moves to punish the person who has allegedly violated 
            that federal citizen's rights.  Of course this is legally 
            appropriate since a federal citizen is little more than a ward of 
            the national government.  Such second-class citizens must be cared 
            for by the government as they are not the masters of their 
            government, but mere servants to it, and it is the master's 
            responsibility to care for his servants. </FONT>
