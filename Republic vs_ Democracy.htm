<CENTER>REPUBLIC vs. DEMOCRACY</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <HR noShade>
  <BR><I>I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,<BR>and 
  to the <U>Republic</U> for which it stands,<BR>one Nation under God, 
  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."</I> 
  <BR><BR>SUMMARY</CENTER><BR>In the Pledge of Allegiance we all pledge 
  allegiance to our Republic, not to a democracy. "Republic" is the proper 
  description of our government, not "democracy." I invite you to join me in 
  raising public awareness regarding that distinction. 
  <P>A republic and a democracy are identical in every aspect except one. In a 
  republic the sovereignty is in each individual person. In a democracy the 
  sovereignty is in the group.<BR><BR>Republic. That form of government in which 
  the powers of sovereignty are vested in the people and are exercised by the 
  people, either directly, or through representatives chosen by the people, to 
  whome those powers are specially delegated. [NOTE: The word "people" may be 
  either plural or singular. In a republic the group only has advisory powers; 
  the sovereign individual is free to reject the majority group-think. 
  USA/exception: if 100% of a jury convicts, then the individual loses 
  sovereignty and is subject to group-think as in a 
  democracy.]<BR><BR>Democracy. That form of government in which the sovereign 
  power resides in and is exercised by the whole body of free citizens directly 
  or indirectly through a system of representation, as distinguished from a 
  monarchy, aristocracy, or oligarchy. [NOTE: In a pure democracy, 51% beats 
  49%. In other words, the minority has no rights. The minority only has those 
  privileges granted by the dictatorship of the majority.]<BR><BR>
  <HR noShade>
  <BR>The distinction between our Republic and a democracy is not an idle one. 
  It has great legal significance. 
  <P>The Constitution guarantees to every state a Republican form of government 
  (Art. 4, Sec. 4). No state may join the United States unless it is a Republic. 
  Our Republic is one dedicated to "liberty and justice for all." Minority 
  individual rights are the priority. The people have natural rights instead of 
  civil rights. The people are protected by the Bill of Rights from the 
  majority. One vote in a jury can stop all of the majority from depriving any 
  one of the people of his rights; this would not be so if the United States 
  were a democracy. (see <A 
  href="http://www.1215.org/lawnotes/lawnotes/pvcright.htm">People's rights vs 
  Citizens' rights</A>) 
  <P>In a pure democracy 51 beats 49[%]. In a democracy there is no such thing 
  as a significant minority: there are no minority rights except civil rights 
  (privileges) granted by a condescending majority. Only five of the U.S. 
  Constitution's first ten amendments apply to Citizens of the United States. 
  Simply stated, a democracy is a dictatorship of the majority. Socrates was 
  executed by a democracy: though he harmed no one, the majority found him 
  intolerable.

  <CENTER>SOME DICTIONARY DEFINITIONS</CENTER>
  <P>Government. ....the government is but an agency of the state, distinguished 
  as it must be in accurate thought from its scheme and machinery of government. 
  ....In a colloquial sense, the United States or its representatives, 
  considered as the prosecutor in a criminal action; as in the phrase, "the 
  government objects to the witness." [Black's Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition, p. 
  625] 
  <P>Government; Republican government. One in which the powers of sovereignty 
  are vested in the people and are exercised by the people, either directly, or 
  through representatives chosen by the people, to whome those powers are 
  specially delegated. In re Duncan, 139 U.S. 449, 11 S.Ct. 573, 35 L.Ed. 219; 
  Minor v. Happersett, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162, 22 L.Ed. 627. [Black's Law 
  Dictionary, Fifth Edition, p. 626] 
  <P>Democracy. That form of government in which the sovereign power resides in 
  and is exercised by the whole body of free citizens directly or indirectly 
  through a system of representation, as distinguished from a monarchy,

  <CENTER>EXAMPLE</CENTER><BR><I>Democratic Form of Government:</I> An 
  environmental organization proposes a bill for the ballot that every 
  individual should reduce his water household usage by 25%. To assure that this 
  goal is met, the government, or private sector, will monitor every 
  individual's household water consumption rate. If an individual does not meet 
  the goal, his first offense is $500 fine. Second offense is $750 fine and 30 
  days community service. Third offense is $1,500 fine and 30 days imprisonment. 
  Fourth offense is $1,750 fine and 90 days imprisonment. Fifth offense is a 
  felony (1-year imprisonment) and $2,000 fine.<BR><BR>The people argue this 
  environmental issue back and forth. They argue the pros and cons of the issue. 
  This great debate is held at town hall meetings. Strong opinions are on both 
  sides of the matter. One side preaches, "It is for the common good!" The other 
  side rebuttals, "This is control and not freedom, and lost of choice!" 
  Election day occurs. The people go to the ballot box to settle the problem. 
  The majority won by a vote of 51% whereas the minority lost with a vote of 
  49%. The minority is ignored. The majority celebrates while the minority jeers 
  in disappointment. Since the majority won, the bill goes in effect. As a 
  result of the majority winning, every individual must reduce his household 
  water usage by 25%. For the reason that the majority has mandatory powers in a 
  democracy. Those who wish to go against the collective (whole body politic) 
  will be punished accordingly. The minority has neither voice nor rights to 
  refuse to accept the dictatorial majority. Everything is mandatory in a 
  democracy. This brings dictatorship and lividity to the 
  realm.<BR><BR><I>Republican Form of Government:</I> An environmental

  of the majority winning, it is advisory that every individual reduce his 
  household water usage by 25%. For the reason that the majority has advisory 
  powers in a republic. Bearing in mind that each individual is equally 
  sovereign in a republic, he is free to reject the majority. He may choose to 
  follow the majority and subject himself to the rule, or he may choose not to 
  follow the majority and not subject himself to the rule. The minority has a 
  voice and rights to refuse to accept the majority. Everything is advisory in a 
  republic. This brings liberty and peace to the realm.<BR><BR>
  <CENTER>COMMENTS</CENTER>
  <P>Notice that in a Democracy, the sovereignty is in the <I>whole</I> body of 
  the free citizens. The sovereignty is not divided to smaller units such as 
  individual citizens. To solve a problem, only the whole body politic is 
  authorized to act. Also, being citizens, individuals have duties and 
  obligations to the government. The government's only obligations to the 
  citizens are those legislatively pre-defined for it by the whole body politic. 

  <P>In a Republic, the sovereignty resides in the people themselves, whether 
  one or many. In a Republic, one may act on his own or through his 
  representatives as he chooses to solve a problem. Further, the people have no 
  obligation to the government; instead, the government being hired by the 
  people, is obliged to its owner, the people. 
  <P>The people own the government agencies. The government agencies own the 
  citizens. In the United States we have a three-tiered cast system consisting 
  of people ---&gt; government agencies ---&gt; and citizens. 
  <P>The people did "ordain and establish this Constitution," not for 
  themselves, but "for the United States of America." In delegating powers to 
  the government agencies the people gave up none of their own. (See Preamble of 
  U.S. Constitution). This adoption of this concept is why the U.S. has been 
  called the <I>"Great Experiment in self government."</I> The People govern 
  themselves, while their agents (government agencies) perform tasks listed in 
  the Preamble for the benefit of the People. The experiment is to answer the 
  question, "Can self-governing people coexist and prevail over government 
  agencies that have no authority over the People?" 
  <P>The citizens of the United States are totally subject to the laws of the 
  United States (See 14th Amendment of U.S. Constitution). NOTE: U.S. 
  citizenship did not exist until July 28, 1868. 
  <P>Actually, the United States is a mixture of the two systems of government 
  (Republican under Common Law, and democratic under statutory law). The People 
  enjoy their God-given natural rights in the Republic. In a democracy, the 
  Citizens enjoy only government granted privileges (also known as civil 
  rights). 
  <P>There was a great political division between two major philosophers, Hobbes 
  and Locke. Hobbes was on the side of government. He believed that sovereignty 
  was vested in the state. Locke was on the side of the People. He believed that 
  the fountain of sovereignty was the People of the state. Statists prefer 
  Hobbes. Populists choose Locke. In California, the Government Code sides with 
  Locke. Sections 11120 and 54950 both say, "The people of this State do not 
  yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them." The preambles of 
  the U.S. and California Constitutions also affirm the choice of Locke by the 
  People. 
  <P>It is my hope that the U.S. will always remain a Republic, because I value 
  individual freedom. 
  <P>Thomas Jefferson said that liberty and ignorance cannot coexist.* Will you 
  help to preserve minority rights by fulfilling the promise in the Pledge of 
  Allegiance to support the Republic? Will you help by raising public awareness 
  of the difference between the Republic and a democracy? 
  <P>
