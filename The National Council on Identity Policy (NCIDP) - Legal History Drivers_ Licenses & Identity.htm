<META name=DESCRIPTION 
content="The National Council on Identity Policy (NCIDP) -Legal History: Drivers' Licenses &amp; Identity&#10;&#10;Contrary to one popular modern myth, Drivers' Licenses were NOT conceived and created to ensure that drivers had appropriate training and skills for driving. After the first Drivers' License requirement was first implemented, licenses were issued for five decades before competency requirements of any kind became widespread.&#10;&#10;The first attempt at issuing drivers' licenses within the U.S. occurred at the cusp of the Twentieth Century, although drivers had been operating vehicles for many years already. These first licenses were promptly ruled (in Chicago v. Collins (Ill S.Ct., 1898)) an unjustifiable/unconscionable/unconstitutional intrusion upon the rights of individuals to travel upon public ways unhindered. The court found that only the regulation of commerce could justify any drivers' license requirements, and only applying such requirement to commercial drivers (cab drivers, truck drivers, etc.) could be justified by it.&#10;&#10;Initially, licenses were issued upon demand, in many cases by mail, and no tests were required. Only a very few states, on the order of two or three perhaps, instituted driver competency standards shortly after instituting their licensing requirement. Most states issued licenses for decades before implementing any driver competency exam requirement. As license requirements were instituted, it appears that no statistically significant reduction in accident rates was found among licensed drivers.

      style="TEXT-DECORATION: none"><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: normal">. They were 
      conceived of originally as a revenue source through imposition of a use 
      tax, and further, were at first applied only to business and trade 
      activities involving driving (cab drivers, freight carriers, cargo 
      deliveries).</SPAN></SPAN></B></P>

      within the U.S. occurred at the cusp of the Twentieth Century, although 
      drivers had been operating vehicles for many years already. These first 
      licenses were promptly ruled (in Chicago v. Collins (Ill S.Ct., 1898)) an

      such public unhindered by such encumbrances and 
laws.</SPAN></SPAN></B></P>

      instituted, it appears that no statistically significant reduction in 
      accident rates was found among licensed drivers. Only formal driver 
      education courses, as they began to appear in high schools across the 
      country, seemed to show an actual beneficial impact upon accident 
      rates.</SPAN></SPAN></B></P>
      <P style="FONT-STYLE: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none" align=left><B>Through 
      World War I, only a small handful of states issued Drivers' Licenses. Many 
      of those states required them only of commercial drivers, but some few 
      states ignored the Illinois Supreme Court precedent, since they weren't 
      Illinois and, therefore, not strictly bound to it, and began requiring 
      licenses of all operators. As the Great Depression unfolded, and viewing 
      license requirements as a potential revenue source, more states began 
      requiring them. <I><U>Still, it appears that only about half or less of 
      all states required licenses by the time that the U.S. entered World War 
      II (1941), and perhaps less than half a dozen required any competency 
      exam</U></I>. The constitutionality of licensing requirements was widely 
      doubted and, indeed, often regarded as a fascist practice that was almost 
      certainly unconstitutional, as had been found in Illinois.</B></P>
      <P align=left><B><U>It wasn't until</U> the influence of rabid McCarthyist 
      <U>fascism swept the nation</U> that all states came to require drivers' 
      licenses and establish competency tests. <SPAN 
      style="TEXT-DECORATION: none"><I>It was also under this influence that 
      licenses first began to take on the role of documentation of 
      identity</I></SPAN>, with states gradually adding increasing amounts of 
      identity information and photographs. <I><U>By the time Reagan left office 
      in 1988, most if not all states had shifted drivers' licenses to the role 
      of identity documentation, and had added photographs to them</U></I>. In 
      most cases, states issuing such licenses had not yet begun attempt to 
      arrogate the identity rights of individuals, and identity recorded on such 
      licenses was as it was stated by the individuals.</B></P>
      <P align=left><B>The finding by the Illinois Supreme Court, that licensing 
      requirements imposed upon private citizens is unconstitutional, appears to 
      have never been reversed, and appears to have been a finding repeated in 
      other lower court cases in other jurisdictions. In short, it appears that, 
      at law, drivers' licenses imposed upon private members of society are very 
      likely entirely unconstitutional, and that the states have simply set out 
      to patently ignore an inconvenient truth, the courts, and the 
      Constitution. And, although the states like to portray driving as a 
      "privilege", and have worked hard to establish that aura around it during 
      the past twenty or so years, the courts appear to have already indicated 
      that it is a right.</B></P>
      <P align=left><B>Construing driving as a right, as courts to date appear 
      to have done, licensing requirements themselves would have to be construed 
      as unconstitutional. It appears that the U.S. Supreme Court has avoided 
      ruling directly on the subject, but other rulings appear to apply to their 
      present status. To quote one ruling, "Decency, security and liberty alike 
      demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of 
      conduct that are commands to the citizen. In a government of laws, 
      existence of the government will be imperilled if it fails to observe the 
      law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. 
      For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is 
      contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for 
      law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites 
      anarchy." (Miranda v Arizona (S Ct., 1966), quoting Olmstead v. U.S. (S 
      Ct., 1928, Brandeis dissenting)).</B></P>
      <P align=left><B>The court also said in another ruling, "The government of 
      the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws and 
      not of men. It will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation, if 
      the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right." 
      (Marbury v. Madison (S Ct., 1803)).</B></P>
      <P align=left><B>"In the Boyd Case, supra, after citing Lord Camden's 
      judgment in Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029, Mr. Justice 
      Bradley said (630): 'The principles laid down in this opinion affect the 
      very essence of constitutional liberty and security. They reach farther 
      than the concrete form of the case then before the court, with its 
      adventitious circumstances; they apply to all invasions on the part of the 
      government and its employees of the sanctity of a man's home and the 
      privacies of life. It is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging 
      of his drawers that constitutes the essence of the offense; but it is the 
      invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty, 
      and private property, where that right has never been forfeited by his 
      conviction of some public offense,-it is the invasion of this sacred right 
      which underlies and constitutes the essence of Lord Camden's judgment.' In 
      Bram v. United States, 168 U.S. 532 , 42 L. ed. 568, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 183, 
      10 Am. Crim. Rep. 547, this court, in speaking by the present Chief 
      Justice of Boyd's Case, dealing with the 4th and 5th Amendments, said 
      (544): 'It was in that case demonstrated that both of these Amendments 
      contemplated perpetuating, in their full efficacy, by means of a 
      constitutional provision, principles of humanity and civil liberty which 
      had been secured in the mother country only after years of struggle, so as 
      to implant them in our institutions in the fullness of their integrity, 
      free from the possibilities of future legislative change.'" (Weeks v. U.S. 
      (S Ct., 1914), quoting Boyd v. U.S. (S Ct., 1886) and Bram v. U.S. (S Ct., 
      1897)).</B></P>
