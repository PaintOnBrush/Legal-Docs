\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 FORMER CODE 1933, \'a7 26-2505 WAS MADE PURPOSEFULLY BROAD to cover actions which might not be otherwise unlawful, but which obstructed or hindered law enforcement officers in carrying out their duties. Hudson v. State, 135 Ga. App. 739, 218 S.E.2d 905 (1975) (see O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 CONSTRUCTION WITH O.C.G.A. \'a7 16-5-23. --Crimes of felony obstruction of a law enforcement officer and simple battery on a law enforcement officer did not address the same criminal conduct, there was no ambiguity created by different punishments being set forth for the same crime, and the rule of lenity did not apply; although the defendant was convicted of both charged crimes, the trial court properly merged the misdemeanor battery conviction into the felony obstruction conviction. McMullen v. State, 325 Ga. App. 757, 754 S.E.2d 798 (2014).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 CONSTRUCTION WITH O.C.G.A. \'a7 16-10-20. --Appeals court rejected the defendant's claim that under the rule of lenity, the defendant's act of violating O.C.G.A. \'a7 16-10-20 could only be considered a misdemeanor, because the acts alleged met the definition of misdemeanor obstruction of a police officer, as both O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \'a7 16-10-20 did not define the same offense, did not address the same criminal conduct, and there was no ambiguity created by different punishments being set forth for the same crime; hence, the rule of lenity did not apply. Banta v. State, 281 Ga. 615, 642 S.E.2d 51 (2007).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 NO MERGER WITH OBSTRUCTING PUBLIC PASSAGE CONVICTION. --It was not error to refuse to merge the defendant's convictions of obstructing a public passage and obstructing a law enforcement officer under O.C.G.A. \'a7\'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 16-11-43 after the defendant placed a barricade across a roadway, refused to move the barricade when ordered to do so, and then, after the officer moved the barricade, replaced the barricade after being told by the officer not to do so. The evidence required to prove the obstruction of a law enforcement officer was not "used up" in proving the obstruction of a public passage. Davis v. State, 288 Ga. App. 66, 653 S.E.2d 358 (2007).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SCOPE OF SECTION. --Former Code 1933, \'a7 26-2505 was meant to cover obstruction of law enforcement officers in general by use of violence, threat of violence, or other unlawful means. Hudson v. State, 135 Ga. App. 739, 218 S.E.2d 905 (1975) (see O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 IMPEACHMENT FOR CONVICTION IN CIVIL TORT ACTION. --In an intentional tort action against a retailer and one of the retailer's employee's, the employee could be impeached with a conviction under O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which occurred after that employee gave a deposition, as the length of punishment that could be imposed thereunder satisfied the requirements of former O.C.G.A. \'a7 24-9-84.1(a)(1) (see now O.C.G.A. \'a7 24-6-609) for impeachment with a conviction, and no other evidence was presented which prohibited the conviction. Todd v. Byrd, 283 Ga. App. 37, 640 S.E.2d 652 (2006), overruled on other grounds, Ferrell v. Mikula, 295 Ga. App. 326, 672 S.E.2d. 7 (2008).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 NO CIVIL DUTY IMPOSED BY CRIMINAL STATUTE. --Injured party was not able to recover under O.C.G.A. \'a7 51-1-6 for the declarant's alleged violation of the criminal statutes O.C.G.A. \'a7 16-10-26, prohibiting giving a false report of a crime, and O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , prohibiting obstructing or hindering the police, as these statutes did not provide for a civil cause of action; furthermore, the legislature provided statutory civil remedies in the form of false arrest under O.C.G.A. \'a7 51-7-1 and malicious prosecution under O.C.G.A. \'a7 51-7-40. Jastram v. Williams, 276 Ga. App. 475, 623 S.E.2d 686 (2005).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 CIVIL RIGHTS ACTION. --In a 42 U.S.C. \'a7 1983 case in which a pro se inmate appealed a district court's 28 U.S.C. \'a7 1915A dismissal of the inmate's claims for false arrest and false imprisonment as barred by the Heck decision, the district court's dismissal was premature since the inmate had not been convicted of violating O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when the district court conducted the court's frivolity review. Nonetheless, the error was harmless since the inmate failed to demonstrate that the inmate's conviction under \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had been reversed or invalidated; the inmate's claims for false arrest and false imprisonment were now barred by the Heck decision. Taylor v. Freeman, No. 10-13573, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 22997 (11th Cir. Nov. 16, 2011) (Unpublished).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    After an arrestee refused a deputy's order to turn around and pushed away from the deputy, the arrestee's excessive force claim failed because, inter alia, the arrestee was uncooperative, a video showed the close contact and the escalating nature of the incident, and the arrestee's refusal to comply with the deputy's instructions was, at least, misdemeanor obstruction. Anthony v. Coffee County, No. 13-15477, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 16897 (11th Cir. Sept. 2, 2014) (Unpublished).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 OFFICER WITHOUT PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST. --Defendant officer was not entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claim because the officer had no arguable probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for misdemeanor obstruction under O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24(\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 a) or disorderly conduct under O.C.G.A. \'a7 16-11-39(a)(3) as it was undisputed that the plaintiff uttered an epithet as the plaintiff was walking away, thus ending any face-to-face confrontation, and that the officer was the only one to hear the phrase. Further, there was no arguable probable cause to arrest the plaintiff. Merenda v. Tabor, No. 5:10-CV-493 (MTT), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63782 (M.D. Ga. May 7, 2012), aff'd in part, appeal dismissed in part, No. 12-12562, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 2351 (11th Cir. Ga. 2013).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 NOT LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE OF INTERFERING WITH GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. --Defendant failed to show that the charge against defendant for obstructing an officer by becoming verbally combative, refusing repeated orders, and resisting restraint under O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , for which defendant was acquitted, was a lesser included offense under O.C.G.A. \'a7 16-1-6 of the charge against defendant of interfering with government property by kicking the sink off the wall and flooding defendant's jail cell under O.C.G.A. \'a7 16-7-24, for which defendant was convicted; a comparison of these two offenses shows that they have entirely different elements and require proof of entirely different facts. Carter v. State, 267 Ga. App. 520, 600 S.E.2d 637 (2004).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 DISTINGUISHED FROM OFFENSE OF TERRORISTIC THREATS. --Defendant's convictions and sentence for terroristic threats and obstruction of an officer did not violate the constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy and cruel and unusual punishment. The crimes are mutually independent and each is aimed at prohibiting specific conduct. Lemarr v. State, 188 Ga. App. 352, 373 S.E.2d 58 (1988).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 FORCE OR VIOLENCE IS NOT AN ELEMENT OF MISDEMEANOR OBSTRUCTION under O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24(\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 a); lying with the intent of misdirecting an officer as to the performance of the officer's official duties can certainly constitute a hindrance and authorize a conviction under that subsection. Duke v. State, 205 Ga. App. 689, 423 S.E.2d 427 (1992); Carter v. State, 222 Ga. App. 397, 474 S.E.2d 228 (1996).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    To consummate an offense of misdemeanor obstruction, some form of knowing and willful opposition to the officer sufficient to constitute obstruction or hindrance is required, but actual violence or threat is not. Weidmann v. State, 222 Ga. App. 796, 476 S.E.2d 18 (1996).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Woodward v. Gray, 241 Ga. App. 847, 527 S.E.2d 595 (2000); Ballew v. State, 245 Ga. App. 842, 538 S.E.2d 902) (2000); and Cooper v. State, 270 Ga. App. 346, 606 S.E.2d 869 (2004), are disapproved to the extent that these cases imply that misdemeanor obstruction still requires proof of forcible resistance or threats of violence. Stryker v. State, 297 Ga. App. 493, 677 S.E.2d 680 (2009).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 INJURY TO THE OFFICER is not an element of felony obstruction of an officer. Fricks v. State, 210 Ga. App. 562, 436 S.E.2d 752 (1993).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUFFICIENCY OF INDICTMENT. --Indictment charging defendant with misdemeanor obstruction was sufficient to apprise defendant of the acts of which defendant was accused because the indictment was substantially in the language of the statute. Turner v. State, 274 Ga. App. 731, 618 S.E.2d 607 (2005).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 JUVENILE PROCEEDINGS. --As a security officer was on school property when a fellow officer told the security officer that a truant juvenile was hiding behind a house, the juvenile could be pursued on suspicion of hindering an officer in the lawful discharge of duties in violation of O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , even if the officer left school grounds, as the officer did so in hot pursuit of a suspected offender. In the Interest of M.P., 279 Ga. App. 344, 631 S.E.2d 383 (2006).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIONS. --On plaintiff arrestee's claim that defendant deputy sheriff falsely arrested the plaintiff for obstruction under O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24(\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 b) after entering plaintiff's home without a warrant to search for the subject of a civil commitment order, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, while the deputy's entry into the arrestee's home was unlawful, the deputy was entitled to qualified immunity as the commitment order's averments indicated the subject was a danger to oneself and others and a reasonable officer could have interpreted those averments as indicating an emergency situation. Bates v. Harvey, 518 F.3d 1233 (11th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 419, 172 L.Ed.2d 289 (2008).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 NEW TRIAL MOTION PROPERLY DENIED. --Upon convictions of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute and obstructing a law enforcement officer, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a new trial as: (1) a challenged juror affirmed the guilty verdict; (2) details about a government witness's plea deal would not have changed the trial outcome; and (3) lab results confirming the purity of the contraband seized was sufficient to show that the substance defendant possessed was cocaine. Tate v. State, 278 Ga. App. 324, 628 S.E.2d 730 (2006).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    In the prosecution on charges of interference with government property and obstruction of a law enforcement officer, the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of the defendant's 1993 interference with government property conviction; a new trial was properly denied because the evidence was properly admitted, not as substantive evidence of the offense at issue, but only as to the issue of credibility, providing support for admission of the evidence. Tate v. State, 289 Ga. App. 479, 657 S.E.2d 531 (2008), cert. denied, No. S08C0986, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 386 (Ga. 2008).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SUPPRESSION MOTION IMPROPERLY GRANTED. --Trial court erroneously granted suppression of the evidence seized in a traffic stop involving two defendants in which an officer, after arresting the first defendant for obstruction, searched the car and found a substance which a field test showed to be cocaine, as the stopping officer was authorized to make the stop based on a violation of O.C.G.A. \'a7 40-6-202 and because the officer could search the passenger compartment of the car incident to the arrest of the first defendant. State v. Stafford, 288 Ga. App. 309, 653 S.E.2d 750 (2007), aff'd, 284 Ga. 773, 671 S.E.2d 484 (2008).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 RECIDIVIST SENTENCE UPHELD. --Because state's written notice sufficiently notified defendant of the state's intent to seek a recidivist sentence under O.C.G.A. \'a7 17-10-7 upon conviction of felony obstruction of an officer, and during plea negotiations the state again referenced defendant's prior criminal history and reiterated the state would seek recidivist punishment, no error occurred in imposing the sentence based on lack of notice. Evans v. State, 290 Ga. App. 746, 660 S.E.2d 841 (2008).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 SENTENCE IN VIOLATION OF PLEA AGREEMENT. --Following the state agreeing to dismiss the RICO and theft charges against the defendant in exchange for a guilty plea to one misdemeanor count of hindering and obstructing a law enforcement officer conditioned upon the defendant testifying truthfully at the trial against the co-defendants, the trial court erred by imposing a sentence upon the defendant which differed from the understood terms of the negotiated plea. Lewis v. State, No. A14A1320, 2014 Ga. App. LEXIS 683 (Oct. 23, 2014).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 CONVICTION AS GROUNDS FOR REVOCATION OF SUPERVISED RELEASE. --Federal district court did not abuse the court's discretion by imposing the highest possible sentence permitted by 18 U.S.C. \'a7 3583(e)(3) after revoking defendant's supervised release term because the defendant was arrested for the misdemeanor of obstruction of officers under O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24(\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 a) during an undercover drug sting, the defendant possessed crack cocaine and marijuana, the defendant violated the technical terms of the defendant's supervised release by failing to report to the defendant's probation officer, and the defendant associated with a known felon. United States v. Webb, No. 06-14755, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 14986 (11th Cir. June 22, 2007) (Unpublished).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 NO PROBABLE CAUSE FOR ARREST. --Defendant's motion to suppress suspected cocaine was properly granted as: (1) police officers lacked probable cause to arrest the defendant for obstruction of justice upon the defendant's flight; (2) an initial uncoercive encounter with the police did not constitute a seizure, and the defendant was free to leave at any time; and (3) the record was devoid of any evidence about the details of an anonymous tip that the defendant was seen selling drugs in the area of the encounter; moreover, given the tip's lack of detail and failure to predict future behavior, observation of the defendant's conduct might have warranted further investigation, but it did not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion needed to briefly detain or even arrest. State v. Dukes, 279 Ga. App. 247, 630 S.E.2d 847 (2006).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    While the defendant police officer did not have to move the officer's car, the officer could not arrest the plaintiff arrestee for reasonably and politely asking the officer to move a foot so that the arrestee could enter the arrestee's driveway, and because the argument that the officer was impeded in the officer's duty under O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  lacked merit, granting the officer summary judgment on a false arrest claim was reversed; the idea that the request provided a basis for arrest collided with the First Amendment, whether or not the officer knew the officer was blocking the arrestee's driveway. Skop v. City of Atlanta, 485 F.3d 1130 (11th Cir. 2007).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 ISSUE WAIVED ON APPEAL REGARDING LEGITIMACY OF ARREST. --Defendant waived the right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence regarding whether a police officer was in the lawful discharge of official duties for purposes of the defendant's conviction for misdemeanor obstruction of a law enforcement officer, in violation of O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24(\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 a), as defense counsel conceded at trial that the officer's arrest was "legitimate," and no action was taken to suggest otherwise.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 OFFICIAL DUTIES LAWFULLY DISCHARGED. --Officers who were summoned to the scene of a domestic disturbance and saw defendant forcibly march defendant's family into their dwelling, quite possibly at gunpoint, had probable cause to effectuate a warrantless arrest for a battery constituting a family violence and, thus, were engaged in the performance of official duties for purposes of O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    When the totality of the circumstances, including the location of the car and the defendant's position in the car, indicated that the defendant was in actual physical control of the vehicle and in possession of an open container of an alcoholic beverage, even though the defendant was not seen driving the car, there was sufficient evidence that the police officers' act of questioning the defendant was more than a consensual inquiry and was within the scope of the officers' official duties so that a jury could reasonably determine that the defendant's use of a false name was a violation. Wynn v. State, 236 Ga. App. 98, 511 S.E.2d 201 (1999).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Officers were lawfully discharging their official duties, despite their unlawful presence in the home with respect to the homeowner, because they had probable cause and a warrant to arrest defendant and defendant had no standing to object to the search of the house.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Dispatcher who reported a crime at a specified location gave police an articulable suspicion to investigate and detain individuals at the scene, particularly because police observations on arriving at the scene corroborated the report.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Evidence that the defendant repeatedly disobeyed the officer's lawful directive to remain in the car for the officer's safety, that the defendant jumped out of the car and confronted the officer, and that the defendant resisted the officer's attempts to physically place the defendant in the car was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction for obstruction of an officer as the evidence showed the defendant knowingly obstructed the officer in the officer's lawful discharge of the officer's duties.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Officer was not required to have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to approach a vehicle parked in a neighborhood the officer was patrolling in the lawful discharge of the officer's official duties; therefore, when the defendant exited the vehicle and attacked the officer, the evidence was sufficient to allow the trier of fact to convict defendant of interference with a law enforcement officer. English v. State, 257 Ga. App. 741, 572 S.E.2d 86 (2002).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of obstruction of a law enforcement officer under O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24(\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 a), where defendant struck the officer after the officer grabbed defendant's grandson's hand; the officer was in the lawful discharge of the officer's official duties, as the officer had a particularized and objective basis for suspecting that the grandson had a marijuana cigarette in the grandson's hand. Smith v. State, 258 Ga. App. 225, 573 S.E.2d 472 (2002).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Because a high school principal told a school security officer to be on the lookout for a juvenile who was skipping class and would be involved in an after-school fight, the officer was engaged in the lawful discharge of official duties when the officer sought to find and detain the juvenile.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Although the evidence that the probationer made the probationer's arrest warrant unavailable to the officers was circumstantial, the evidence was sufficient to authorize the trial court's finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the probationer obstructed the officers. Carlson v. State, 280 Ga. App. 595, 634 S.E.2d 410 (2006), cert. denied, No. S06C2099, 2007 Ga. LEXIS 215 (Ga. 2007).

Copeland v. State, 281 Ga. App. 11, 635 S.E.2d 283 (2006).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Juvenile's interference with a juvenile probation officer's attempt to take the juvenile into custody, after the juvenile tested positive for illegal drug use, was sufficient to support an adjudication under O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24(\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 b).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Because there was sufficient evidence that a road that the defendant was obstructing was a public passage, there was no merit to the defendant's argument that an officer who ordered the defendant not to block the road was not lawfully discharging the officer's official duties.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Defendant juvenile's arrest was not defective because a law enforcement officer was engaged in the discharge of a juvenile court's pick-up order, which the defendant resisted, thus providing probable cause for the defendant's arrest for obstruction in violation of O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Trial court did not err in denying a defendant juvenile's motion for a directed verdict and in adjudicating the defendant delinquent on an obstruction charge because an officer working as a security guard at a restaurant was engaged in the lawful discharge of the officer's official duties at the time of the officer's encounter with the defendant as required by O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Defendant was lawfully detained and searched for weapons because the defendant matched a citizen's specific description and location of a person who had been shooting a gun, and the defendant had threatened to kill the sheriff (who was physically present) on as many as six previous occasions. The jury could find that when the defendant elbowed the chief in the course of the pat-down, the defendant committed felony obstruction in violation of O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24(\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 b).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Trial court did not err by rejecting the defendant's written request for a jury charge on misdemeanor obstruction of a law enforcement officer as a lesser included offense of felony obstruction because the evidence established that the defendant committed felony obstruction or no crime at all, thus, there was no evidentiary basis for the charge on the lesser included offense. Watson v. State, No. A14A1039, 2014 Ga. App. LEXIS 582 (Aug. 15, 2014).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 REQUESTED JURY INSTRUCTION NOT WARRANTED. --Because the defendant was neither indicted nor tried for felony obstruction of justice, the court did not err in refusing to give the requested charge that an accomplice was the one who was present at the commission of a crime, aiding and abetting the perpetrator, or an accessory before the fact; moreover, the court's own charge, which included pattern charges on parties to a crime, knowledge, mere presence at the scene of a crime, and mere association with others committing a crime, substantially covered the same legal principles as the requested charge. Buruca v. State, 278 Ga. App. 650, 629 S.E.2d 438 (2006).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    In an armed robbery prosecution, defense counsel was not deficient in not requesting jury charges on the law of abandonment and accessory after-the-fact as there was no evidence that the defendant abandoned the crime before an overt act occurred or that the defendant was an accessory after the fact rather than a party to the robbery. Bihlear v. State, 295 Ga. App. 486, 672 S.E.2d 459 (2009).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Trial court did not err in refusing to charge the jury that "Something more than mere disagreement or remonstrance must be shown." The charge as a whole adequately covered the principle of law and allowed the defendant to argue that the defendant should have been acquitted because the state proved only disagreement or remonstrance. Kendrick v. State, 324 Ga. App. 45, 749 S.E.2d 45 (2013).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 FAILURE TO INSTRUCT ON LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSE DID NOT AMOUNT TO INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE. --Because trial counsel made a reasonable decision to pursue an all-or-nothing defense strategy based on counsel's review of the evidence, the appellate court found no merit in the defendant's claim that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance due to failure to request a charge on misdemeanor obstruction as a lesser included offense of felony obstruction of an officer. Ingram v. State, 317 Ga. App. 606, 732 S.E.2d 456 (2012).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 CHARGE ON MISDEMEANOR OBSTRUCTION WAS NOT WARRANTED. --Because the defendant decided to pursue an "all or nothing" defense, the trial court did not err in making the decision to not charge the jury on misdemeanor obstruction, sua sponte, as such would have undermined that defense. Owens v. State, 288 Ga. App. 771, 655 S.E.2d 244 (2007), cert. denied, 2008 Ga. LEXIS 274 (Ga. 2008).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Since the evidence showed completion of the greater offense of felony obstruction, the trial court did not err in failing to charge on misdemeanor obstruction as a lesser included offense. Carlson v. State, No. A14A0764, 2014 Ga. App. LEXIS 674 (Oct. 20, 2014).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 CHARGE ON ENTIRE SECTION NOT ERROR. --Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to a jury charge on the entire obstruction code section, O.C.G.A. \'a7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 16-10-24\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , although there was no evidence that the defendant offered or threatened violence. The trial court instructed the jury to consider the evidence in light of the charges in the indictment. Williams v. State, 309 Ga. App. 688, 710 S.E.2d 884 (2011).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 JURY QUESTION. --Whether actions hinder or impede officers in carrying out assigned duties is for jury determination. Hudson v. State, 135 Ga. App. 739, 218 S.E.2d 905 (1975).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Given the sheriff's uncontradicted statement that the sheriff ordered the streets cleared in the face of large scale rioting, and the evidence that the arrestees -- later plaintiffs in a civil rights action -- were among those who refused to obey the order and were arrested for obstructing the efforts of police officers to restore order, a jury issue was presented on whether their conduct hindered or impeded the sheriff in the lawful discharge of the sheriff's official duties. Wilson v. Attaway, 757 F.2d 1227 (11th Cir. 1985).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Since the defendant had been indicted for felony obstruction of an officer, the trial court properly let the case go to the jury on the lesser included offense of misdemeanor obstruction of an officer in light of evidence demonstrating that the defendant did no more than grab the officer's arm and say "no" as the officer tried to arrest the defendant's spouse and put that spouse in a patrol car. Williams v. State, 196 Ga. App. 154, 395 S.E.2d 399 (1990).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Whether or not the evidence established that actions taken by the defendant hindered or obstructed the officer in making the arrest is for the jury to decide. Cason v. State, 197 Ga. App. 308, 398 S.E.2d 292 (1990), overruled on other grounds, Duke v. State, 205 Ga. App. 689, 423 S.E.2d 427 (1992).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    In a case involving charges of obstruction of an officer and attempting to elude, a motion for directed verdict was properly denied where the officer was investigating the defendant for driving under the influence and the defendant did not respond to the officer's orders and forced the officer to get a warrant to effectuate an arrest. Reed v. State, 205 Ga. App. 209, 422 S.E.2d 15, cert. denied, 205 Ga. App. 901, 422 S.E.2d 15 (1992).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Although the defendant's testimony deviated significantly from the officers', such differences were matters for the jury to resolve. Jones v. State, 242 Ga. App. 357, 529 S.E.2d 644 (2000).
