<H2 align=center>AFFIDAVIT OF TRUTH</H2>Be it known to all who call themselves 
"government," their "courts," agents, and other parties, that I, 
<P>_____________________________________________, <BR>am a natural, freeborn 
sovereign individual, without subjects. I am neither subject to any entity 
anywhere, nor is any entity subject to me. I neither dominate anyone, nor am I 
dominated. 
<P>I am not a "person" as defined in "statutes" when such definition includes 
"artificial entities." I refuse to be treated as a "federally" or "state" 
created entity which is only capable of exercising certain rights, privileges, 
or immunities as specifically "granted" by "federal" or "state" "governments." 
<P>I may voluntarily choose to comply with the "laws" which others attempt to 
impose upon me, but no such "laws," nor their "enforcers," have any authority 
over me. I am not in any "jurisdiction," for I am not of subject status. 
<P>Unless I have wilfully harmed or violated someone or someone's property 
without their consent, I have not committed any crime, and am therefore not 
subject to any penalty. 
<P>Thus, be it known to all, that I reserve my natural right not to be compelled 
to perform under any "contract" that I did not enter into knowingly, 
voluntarily, and intentionally. Furthermore, I do not accept the "liability" 
associated with the compelled and pretended "benefit" of any hidden or 
unrevealed "contract" or "commercial agreement." 
<P>As such, the hidden or unrevealed "contracts" that supposedly create 
"obligations" to perform, for persons of subject status, are inapplicable to me, 
and are null and void. If I have participated in any of the supposed "benefits" 
associated with these hidden "contracts," I have done so under duress, for lack 
of any other practical alternative. I may have received such "benefits" but I 
have not accepted them in a manner that binds me to anything. 
<P>Any such participation does not constitute "acceptance," because of the 
absence of full disclosure of any valid offer, and voluntary consent without 
misrepresentation or coercion. Without a valid voluntary offer and acceptance, 
knowingly entered into by both parties, there is no "meeting of the minds," and 
therefore no valid contract. Any supposed "contract" is therefore void, <U>from 
the beginning</U>. 
<P>From my age of consent to the date affixed below I have never signed a 
contract knowingly, willingly, intelligently, voluntarily, and intentionally 
whereby I have waived any of my natural inherent rights, and, as such, <B>take 
notice</B> that I revoke, cancel, and make void <U>from the beginning</U> my 
signature on any and all "contracts," "agreements," "forms," or any "instrument" 
which may be construed in any way to give any agency or department of any 
"government" any "authority," "venue," or "jurisdiction" over me. 
<P>Typical examples of such compelled and pretended "benefits" are: 
<OL>
  <LI><B><U>"Birth Certificate"</U>:</B> The fact that a "birth certificate" was 
  issued to me by a local hospital or "government" agency when I was born, is 
  irrelevant to my sovereignty. No status, high or low, can be assigned to 
  another person through a piece of paper, without the recipient's full 
  knowledge and consent. Therefore, such a piece of paper provides date and 
  place information only. It indicates nothing about "jurisdiction," nothing 
  about property ownership, nothing about rights, and nothing about subject 
  status. The only documents that can have any significance, as it concerns my 
  status in society, are those which I have signed as an adult, with full 
  knowledge and consent, free from misrepresentation or coercion of any kind. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B><U>The use of national currency to discharge my debts</U>:</B> I have 
  used these only because there is no other widely recognized currency. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B><U>The use of a bank account</U>:</B> If there is any hidden "contract" 
  behind an account, my signature therewith gives no validity to it. The 
  signature is only for verification of identity. I can not be obligated to 
  fulfill any hidden or unrevealed "contract" whatsoever, due to the absence of 
  full disclosure and voluntary consent. 
  <P>Likewise, my use of the bank account is due to the absence of an 
  alternative. To not use any bank at all is very difficult and impractical. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B><U>The use of a "driver's license"</U>:</B> There is no real need for 
  me to have such a "license" for travelling in a car. However, if I am stopped 
  for any reason and found to be without a "license," it is likely I would be 
  unduly harassed and penalized. Therefore, under duress, I carry a "license" 
  only to avoid extreme inconvenience. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B><U>"State plates" on my car</U>:</B> Similarly, if I have "registered" 
  my car with the "state" and carry the "state plates" on it, I have done so 
  only because to have any other "plates" or no "plates" at all, causes me to 
  run the risk of "police officer" harassment and extreme inconvenience. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B><U>The use of a "passport"</U>:</B> There is no real need for me to 
  have a "passport" (or other associated "permits," "visas," etc.) to travel. I 
  have the right to travel without hindrance, wherever, however, and whenever I 
  wish, so long as I do not encroach upon the private property of others. Though 
  without a "passport," my right to travel is unduly hindered. Therefore, under 
  duress, I only use a "passport" to prevent extreme inconvenience and to ensure 
  that I can travel from one "country" to another at all. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B><U>Past "filing" of "tax returns"</U>:</B> Because such "tax returns" 
  were "filed" under threat, duress, and coercion, and no two-way contract was 
  ever signed with full disclosure, there is nothing in any past "filing" of 
  "tax returns" or payments that created any valid contract. Therefore, no 
  obligation on my part was ever created. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B><U>Past "enrolment" and "voting"</U>:</B> Similarly, since no 
  obligation to perform in any manner was ever revealed in print, as part of the 
  "requirements" for the supposed "privilege" to "enrol" and "vote," any such 
  "enrolment" or "voting" does not oblige me to do anything, nor grant any 
  "jurisdiction" over me to anyone. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B><U>"Citizenship"</U>:</B> Any document I may have ever signed, in which 
  I answered "yes" to the question, "Are you a [insert name of "country" here] 
  citizen?" - cannot be used to compromise my status as a sovereign, nor 
  obligate me to perform in any manner. This is because without full written 
  disclosure of the definition and consequences of such supposed "citizenship," 
  provided in a document bearing my signature given freely without 
  misrepresentation or coercion, there can be no binding contract. 
  <P>I am not a "[insert name of "country" here] citizen." I am not a "resident 
  of," an "inhabitant of," a "franchise of," a "subject of," a "ward of," the 
  "property of," the "chattel of," or "subject to the jurisdiction of" any 
  "monarch" or any corporate "commonwealth," "federal," "state," "territory," 
  "county," "council," "city," "municipal body politic," or other "government" 
  allegedly "created" under the "authority" of a "constitution" or other 
  "enactment." I am not subject to any "legislation," department, or agency 
  created by such "authorities," nor to the "jurisdiction" of any employees, 
  officers, or agents deriving their "authority" therefrom. Nor do any of the 
  "statutes" or "regulations" of such "authorities" apply to me or have any 
  "jurisdiction" over me. 
  <P>Further, I am not a subject of any "courts" or bound by "precedents" of any 
  "courts," deriving their "jurisdiction" from said "authorities." <B>Take 
  notice</B> that I hereby cancel and make void <U>from the beginning</U> any 
  such "instrument" or any presumed "election" made by any "government" or any 
  agency or department thereof, that I am or ever have voluntarily elected to be 
  treated as a subject of any "monarch" or a "[insert name of "country" here] 
  citizen," or a "resident" of any "commonwealth," "state," "territory," 
  "possession," "instrumentality," "enclave," "division," "district," or 
  "province," subject to their "jurisdiction(s)." 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B><U>"Constitution"</U>:</B> The document supposedly setting forth the 
  foundations of a "country" and "its" "government," has no inherent authority 
  or obligation. A "constitution" has no authority or obligation at all, unless 
  as a contract between two or more individuals, and then it is limited only to 
  those individuals who have specifically entered into it. At most, such a 
  document could be a contract between the existing people at the time of its 
  creation, but no-one has the right, authority, or power to bind their 
  posterity. I have not knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally entered into 
  any such "constitution" contract to oblige myself thereby, therefore such a 
  document is inapplicable to me, and anyone claiming to derive their 
  "authority" from such a document has no "jurisdiction" over me. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B><U>Use of semantics</U>:</B> There are some immature people with mental 
  imbalances, such as the craving to dominate other people, who masquerade as 
  "government," and call the noises and scribbles that emanate from their mouths 
  and pens "the law" which "must be obeyed." Just because they alter definitions 
  of words in their "law" books to their supposed advantage, doesn't mean I 
  accept those definitions. The fact that they define the words "person," 
  "address," "mail," "resident," "motor vehicle," "driving," "passenger," 
  "employee," "income," and many others, in ways different from the common 
  usage, so as to be associated with a subject or slave status, means nothing in 
  real life. 
  <P>Because the "courts" have become entangled in the game of semantics, be it 
  known to all "courts" and all parties, that if I have ever signed any document 
  or spoken any words on record, using words defined by twists in any "law" 
  books different from the common usage, there can be no effect whatsoever on my 
  sovereign status in society thereby, nor can there be created any "obligation" 
  to perform in any manner, by the mere use of such words. Where the definition 
  in the common dictionary differs from the definition in the "law" dictionary, 
  it is the definition in the common dictionary that prevails, because it is 
  more trustworthy. </P></LI></OL>
<P>Such compelled and supposed "benefits" include, but are not limited to, the 
aforementioned typical examples. My use of such alleged "benefits" is under 
duress only, and is with full reservation of all my natural inherent rights. I 
have waived none of my intrinsic rights and freedoms by my use thereof. 
Furthermore, my use of such compelled "benefits" may be temporary, until 
alternatives become available, practical, and widely recognized. 
<P align=center><B>REVOCATION OF POWER OF ATTORNEY</B></P>I hereby revoke, 
rescind, cancel, and make void <U>from the beginning</U>, all powers of 
attorney, in fact or otherwise, implied in "law" or otherwise, signed either by 
me or anyone else, as it pertains to any "tax file/identification number" and/or 
"social security number" assigned to me, as it pertains to my "birth 
certificate," and as it pertains to any and all other numbers, "licenses," 
"certificates," and other "instruments" issued by any and all "government" and 
quasi-"governmental" departments or agencies, due to the use of various elements 
of fraud by said agencies to attempt to deprive me of my sovereignty and/or 
property. 
<P>I hereby waive, cancel, repudiate, and refuse to knowingly accept any alleged 
"benefit" or "gratuity" associated with any of the aforementioned numbers, 
"licenses," "certificates," and other "instruments." My use of any such numbers, 
"licenses," "certificates," or other "instruments" has been for information 
purposes only, and does not grant any "jurisdiction" to anyone. 
<P>I do hereby revoke and rescind all powers of attorney, in fact or otherwise, 
signed by me or otherwise, implied in "law" or otherwise, with or without my 
consent or knowledge, as it pertains to any and all property, real or personal, 
corporeal or incorporeal, obtained in the past, present, or future. I am the 
sole and absolute owner and possess allodial title to any and all such property. 

<P><B>Take notice</B> that I also revoke, cancel, and make void <U>from the 
beginning</U> all powers of attorney, in fact, in presumption, or otherwise, 
signed either by me or anyone else, claiming to act on my behalf, with or 
without my consent, as such power of attorney pertains to me or any property 
owned by me, by, but not limited to, any and all quasi/colorable, public, 
"governmental" departments, agencies or corporations on the grounds of 
constructive fraud, concealment, and nondisclosure of pertinent facts. 
<P>
