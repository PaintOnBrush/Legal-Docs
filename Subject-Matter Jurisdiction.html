<p><tt>Subject-matter jurisdiction is the authority of the court to hear
and make a determination in a court action. <b><u>In Interest of M.V.</u></b>,
288 Ill.App.3d 300, 681 N.E.2d 532 (1st Dist. 1997). Without subject-matter
jurisdiction, all of the orders and judgments issued by a judge are <b>void</b>
under law, and are of no legal force or effect. <b><u>In Interest of M.V.</u></b>,
288 Ill.App.3d 300, 681 N.E.2d 532 (1st Dist. 1997) ("Every act of the
court beyond that power is void").</tt>
<p><tt>Under the current 1970 Illinois Constitution, all courts have general
jurisdiction; however in any proceeding based on an Illinois statute (whether
divorce, adoption, paternity, juvenile, probate, traffic, Illinois Appellate
Courts, Federal Courts, Bankruptcy Court, etc., i.e., in any statutory
proceeding), the court immediately loses its general jurisdiction powers
and becomes a court governed by the rules of limited jurisdiction.
<b><u>In
Interest of M.V.</u></b>, 288 Ill.App.3d 300, 681 N.E.2d 532 (1st Dist.
1997) ("Where a court's power to act is controlled by statute, the court
is governed by the rules of limited jurisdiction, and courts exercising
jurisdiction over such matters must proceed within the strictures of the
statute.");
<b><u>In re Marriage of Milliken</u></b>, 199 Ill.App.3d 813,
557 N.E.2d 591 (1st Dist. 1990) ("The jurisdiction of a court in a dissolution
proceeding is limited to that conferred by statute."); <b><u>Vulcan Materials
Co. v. Bee Const. Co., Inc.</u></b>, 101 Ill.App.3d 30, 40, 427 N.E.2d
797 (1st Dist. 1981) ("Though a court be one of general jurisdiction, when
its power to act on a particular matter is controlled by statute, the court
is governed by the rules of limited jurisdiction."); <b><u>In re M.M.</u>,
</b>156
Ill.2d 53, 619 N.E.2d 702 (1993) ("The legislature may define the `justiciable
matter' in such a way as to preclude or limit the authority of the circuit
court. [Citations] When a court's power to act is controlled by statute,
the court is governed by the rules of limited jurisdiction [Citations],
and courts exercising jurisdiction over such matters must proceed within
the strictures of the statute."); <b><u>Brown v. VanKeuren</u></b>, 340
Ill. 118, 122 (1930) ("Whatever the rank of the court exercising a special
statutory jurisdiction, it is governed by the same rules as courts of limited
jurisdiction.");
<b><u>Midland Coal Co. v. Knox County</u></b>, 268 Ill.App.3d
485, 644 N.E.2d 796 (4th Dist. 1994) ("Special statutory jurisdiction is
limited to the language of the act conferring it, and the court has no
powers from any other source. ... [T]he authority of the court to make
any order must be found in the statute.
<b><u>Levy v. Industrial Comm'n</u></b>
(1931), 346 Ill. 49, 51, 178 N.E. 370, 371.");

590 (2nd Dist. 1996) ("A court in the exercise of special statutory jurisdiction
is limited in its power by the language of the act conferring such jurisdiction.");
<b><u>In
Interest of Rami M.</u></b>, 285 Ill.App.3d 267, 673 N.E.2d 358 (1st Dist.
1996) ("In cases where the court is conferred power to adjudicate by virtue
of a statute, the court's jurisdiction is strictly limited by the statute.").</tt>
<p><tt>It is clear and well-established law in Illinois that a divorce
proceeding occurs only in a court of limited jurisdiction. The writer can
find no cases that claim that a divorce proceeding, or any statutory proceeding,
takes place in courts of general jurisdiction.</tt>
<center>
<p><b><tt><font size=+1>NO PRESUMPTION OF JURISDICTION</font></tt></b></center>

<p><tt>While in a court of general jurisdiction, there is a presumption
that the judge has subject-matter jurisdiction, such is not the case in
courts of limited jurisdiction. In all courts of limited jurisdiction,
there is no presumption of subject-matter jurisdiction.</tt>
<p><tt>In all courts of limited jurisdiction, the record of the case must
support any claim of subject-matter jurisdiction. If subject-matter jurisdiction
does not appear from the record of the case, the presiding judge is acting
without subject-matter jurisdiction and his/her orders are void, of no
legal force or effect.<b> <u>State Bank of Lake Zurich v. Thill</u></b>,
113 Ill.2d 294, 497 N.E.2d 1156 (1986) ("In determining whether a lack
of jurisdiction is apparent from the record, we must look to the whole
record, which includes the pleadings, the return on the process, the verdict
of the jury, and the judgment or decree of the court.");<b> <u>Wabash Area
Development, Inc. v. Ind. Com.</u></b>, 88 Ill.2d 392 (1981) ("that compliance
with the statutory requirements for the issuance of the writ must affirmatively
appear in the record.");<b> <u>I.C.R.R. Co. v. Hasenwinkle</u></b>, 232
Ill. 224, 227 (1908) ("The law presumes nothing in favor of the jurisdiction
of a court exercising special statutory powers, such as those given by
statute under which the court acted, (Chicago and Northwestern Railway
Co. v. Galt, 133 Ill. 657), and the record must affirmatively show the
facts necessary to give jurisdiction. The record must show that the statute
was complied with");<b> <u>In re Marriage of Stefiniw</u>, </b>253 Ill.App.3d
196, 625 N.E.2d 358 (1st Dist. 1993) ("A judgment is characterized as void
and may be collaterally attacked at any time where the record itself furnished
the facts which establish that the court acted without jurisdiction.");<b><u>People
v. Byrnes</u></b>, 34 Ill.App.3d 983, 341 N.E.2d 729 (2nd Dist. 1975) ("Whereas
a court of general jurisdiction is presumed to have jurisdiction to render
any judgment in a case arising under the common law, there is no such presumption
of jurisdiction in cases arising under a specific statutory grant of authority.
In the later cases the record must reveal the facts which authorize the
court to act.");<b> <u>Zook v. Spannaus</u></b>, 34 Ill.2d 612, 217 N.E.2d
789 (1966) ("In the absence of such findings in the record and in the absence
of any evidence in the record to support such findings the court was without
jurisdiction in this special statutory proceeding to enter an order authorizing
the guardian to consent to adoption.");<b><u>Fico v. Industrial Com.</u>,
</b>353
Ill. 74 (1933) ("Where the court is exercising a special statutory jurisdiction
the record must show upon its face that the case is one where the court
has authority to act.").</tt>
<p><tt>The judge has a duty to continually inspect the record of the case,
and if subject-matter jurisdiction does not appear at any time from the
record of the case, then he has the duty to dismiss the case as lacking
subject-matter jurisdiction. Should a judge act in any case in which he
does not have subject-matter jurisdiction, he is acting unlawfully,<b><u>U.S.
v. Will</u></b>, 449 U.S. 200, 216, 101 S.Ct. 471, 66 L.Ed.2d 392, 406
(1980);<b> <u>Cohens v. Virginia</u></b>, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat) 264, 404, 5
L.Ed 257 (1821), and without any judicial authority.</tt>
<center>
<p><b><tt><font size=+1>WHEN A PARTY DENIES JURISDICTION</font></tt></b></center>

<p><tt>In a court of limited jurisdiction, whenever a party denies that
the court has subject-matter jurisdiction, it becomes the duty and the
burden of the party claiming that the court has subject-matter jurisdiction
to provide evidence from the record of the case that the court holds subject-matter
jurisdiction.<b> <u>Bindell v. City of Harvey</u></b>, 212 Ill.App.3d 1042,
571 N.E.2d 1017 (1st Dist. 1991) ("the burden of proving jurisdiction rests
upon the party asserting it."); <b><u>Loos v. American Energy Savers, Inc.</u></b>,
168 Ill.App.3d 558, 522 N.E.2d 841 (1988) ("Where jurisdiction is contested,
the burden of establishing it rests upon the plaintiff.").</tt>
<p><tt>Until the plaintiff/petitioner submits uncontroverted evidence of
subject-matter jurisdiction to the court that the court has subject-matter
jurisdiction, the court is proceeding without subject-matter jurisdiction.
Should the plaintiff/petitioner not provide uncontroverted evidence of
subject-matter jurisdiction, all orders or judgments issued by the judge
are void ab initio. A judge should not proceed in any action in which the
judge does not have subject-matter jurisdiction, since he/she has no lawful
authority to act.</tt>
<p><tt>The law places the duty and the burden upon the plaintiff/petitioner.
Should the court attempt to place the burden upon the defendant/respondent,
the court has acted against the law, violates the defendant/respondent's
due process rights, and the judge under court decisions has immediately
lost subject-matter jurisdiction.</tt>
<center>
<p><b><tt><font size=+1>COURT MUST PROCEED ACCORDING TO LAW OR STATUTE</font></tt></b></center>

<p><tt>In a court of limited jurisdiction, the court must proceed exactly
according to the law or statute under which it operates.<b> <u>Flake v.
Pretzel</u></b>, 381 Ill. 498, 46 N.E.2d 375 (1943) ("the actions, being
statutory proceedings, ... were void for want of power to make them.")
("The judgments were based on orders which were void because the court
exceeded its jurisdiction in entering them. Where a court, after acquiring
jurisdiction of a subject matter, as here, transcends the limits of the
jurisdiction conferred, its judgment is void.");<b> <u>Armstrong v. Obucino</u></b>,
300 Ill. 140, 143, 133 N.E. 58 (1921) ("The doctrine that where a court
has once acquired jurisdiction it has a right to decide every question
which arises in the cause, and its judgment or decree, however erroneous,
cannot be collaterally assailed, is only correct when the court proceeds
according to the established modes governing the class to which the case
belongs and does not transcend in the extent and character of its judgment
or decree the law or statute which is applicable to it."</tt>
<p><tt>Whenever a judge does not exactly comply with the statute, he/she
has lost subject-matter jurisdiction and all orders or judgments issued
without subject-matter jurisdiction are void, of no legal force or effect.</tt>
<center>
<p><b><tt><font size=+1>IN COURTS OF LIMITED JURISDICTION,</font></tt></b>
<br><b><tt><font size=+1>ALL ORDERS MUST CONTAIN THE SPECIFIC</font></tt></b>
<br><b><tt><font size=+1>FINDINGS THAT THE COURT HAS JURISDICTION</font></tt></b></center>

<p><tt>All orders or judgments issued by a judge in a court of limited
jurisdiction must contain the findings of the court showing that the court
has subject-matter jurisdiction, not allegations that the court has jurisdiction.<b><u>In
re Jennings</u>, </b>68 Ill.2d 125, 368 N.E.2d 864 (1977) ("in a special
statutory proceeding an order must contain the jurisdictional findings
prescribed by statute.");<b> <u>Zook v. Spannaus</u></b>, 34 Ill.2d 612,
217 N.E.2d 789 (1966).</tt>
<p><tt>Our Supreme Court has ruled that "Because a court does not acquire
jurisdiction by a mere recital contrary to what is shown in the record",
the record of the case is the determinating factor as to whether a court
has jurisdiction.<b> <u>State Bank of Lake Zurich v. Thill</u></b>, 113
Ill.2d 294, 497 N.E.2d 1156 (1986).</tt>
<p><tt>A judge's allegation that he has subject-matter jurisdiction is
only an allegation<b> (<u>Lombard v. Elmore</u></b>, 134 Ill.App.3d 898,
480 N.E.2d 1329 (1st Dist. 1985);<b> <u>Hill v. Daily</u>, </b>28 Ill.App.3d
202, 204, 328 N.E.2d 142 (1975)); inspection of the record of the case
has been ruled to be the controlling factor. If the record of the case
does not support subject-matter jurisdiction, then the judge has acted
without subject-matter jurisdiction. <b><u>The People v. Brewer</u>, </b>328
Ill. 472, 483 (1928) ("If it could not legally hear the matter upon the
jurisdictional paper presented, its finding that it had the power can add
nothing to its authority, – it had no authority to make that finding.").</tt>
<p><tt>Without the specific findings of jurisdiction by the court in an
order or judgment, the order or judgment does not comply with the law and
is void.</tt>
<center>
<p><b><tt><font size=+1>NO STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</font></tt></b>
<br><b><tt><font size=+1>TO CHALLENGE A VOID ORDER</font></tt></b></center>

<p><tt>Since a void order has no legal force or effect there can be no
time limit within which to challenge the order or judgment. Further since
the order has no legal force or effect, it can be repeatedly challenged,
since no judge has the lawful authority to make a void order valid.<b><u>Bates
v. Board of Education, Allendale Community Consolidated School District
No. 17</u>,</b> 136 Ill.2d 260, 267 (1990) (a court "cannot confer jurisdiction
where none existed and cannot make a void proceeding valid.");<b> <u>People
ex rel. Gowdy v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co.</u></b>, 385 Ill. 86, 92,
52 N.E.2d 255 (1943).</tt>
<center>
<p><b><tt><font size=+1>NO RESTRICTION ON VENUE TO VACATE A VOID ORDER</font></tt></b></center>

<p><tt>It is clear and well established law that a void order can be challenged
in any court.<b> <u>Old Wayne Mut. L. Assoc. v. McDonough</u>,</b> 204
U.S. 8, 27 S.Ct. 236 (1907) ("jurisdiction of any court exercising authority
over a subject `may be inquired into in every other court when the proceedings
in the former are relied upon and brought before the latter by a party
claiming the benefit of such proceedings,' and the rule prevails whether
`the decree or judgment has been given, in a court of admiralty, chancery,
ecclesiastical court, or court of common law, or whether the point ruled
has arisen under the laws of nations, the practice in chancery, or the
municipal laws of states.'");<b> <u>In re Marriage of Macino</u></b>, 236
Ill.App.3d 886 (2nd Dist. 1992) ("if the order is void, it may be attacked
at any time in any proceeding, ");<b> <u>Evans v. Corporate Services</u>,</b>
207 Ill.App.3d 297, 565 N.E.2d 724 (2nd Dist. 1990) ("a void judgment,

or collaterally");<b> <u>Oak Park Nat. Bank v. Peoples Gas Light &amp;

thereby."). [Emphasis added].</tt>
<center>
<p><b><tt><font size=+1>NO RESTRICTION ON TIME TO VACATE A VOID ORDER</font></tt></b></center>

<p><tt>It is also clear and well established law that a <b>void</b> order
can be challenged in any court at any time.<b> <u>People v. Wade</u></b>,
116 Ill.2d 1, 506 N.E.2d 954 (1987) ("A <b>void</b> judgment may be attacked
at any time, either directly or collaterally.");<b> <u>In re Marriage of
Macino</u></b>, 236 Ill.App.3d 886 (2nd Dist. 1992) ("if the order is <b>void</b>,
it may be attacked at any time in any proceeding, ";<b> <u>Evans v. Corporate
Services</u></b>, 207 Ill.App.3d 297, 565 N.E.2d 724 (2nd Dist. 1990) ("a
<b>void</b>
judgment, order or decree may be attacked at any time or in any court,
either directly or collaterally"). [Emphasis added].</tt>
<center>
<p><b><tt><font size=+1>CAN BE CHALLENGED BY A THIRD PARTY</font></tt></b></center>

<p><tt>If an order or judgment was granted by a judge without subject-matter
jurisdiction in a court of limited jurisdiction, then a third-party to
the action can challenge the validity of that order in any court, if the
third party was damaged in any way by the <b>void</b> order. Since an order
or judgment issued without subject-matter jurisdiction has no legal force
or effect, it cannot be used to damage any other party.<b> <u>Oak Park
Nat. Bank v. Peoples Gas Light &amp; Coke Co.</u></b>, 46 Ill.App.2d 385,

or by any other person who is affected thereby."). [Emphasis added].</tt>
<center>
<p><b><tt><font size=+1>VOID ORDERS ARE VOID EVEN BEFORE REVERSAL</font></tt></b></center>

<p><tt>The law is well-settled that a <b>void</b> order or judgment is

Marine Ins. Co.</u></b>, 254 U.S. 348, 41 S.Ct. 116 (1920) ("Courts are
constituted by authority and they cannot go beyond that power delegated
to them. If they act beyond that authority, and certainly in contravention
of it, their judgments and orders are regarded as nullities. They are not
voidable, but simply <b>VOID, AND THIS EVEN PRIOR TO REVERSAL.</b>" [Emphasis

<center>
<p><b><tt><font size=+1>ELEMENTS OF LACK OF JURISDICTION</font></tt></b></center>

<p><tt>In courts of limited jurisdiction, subject-matter jurisdiction is
determined only by an inspection of the record of the case. The inspection
of the record of the case must show that all of the elements of subject-matter
jurisdiction existed, and existed at all times.<b> <u>State Bank of Lake
Zurich v. Thill</u></b>, 113 Ill.2d 294, 497 N.E.2d 1156 (1986);<b> <u>Herb
v. Pitcairn</u></b>, 384 Ill. 237, 241 (1943);<b> <u>People ex rel. Curtin
v. Heizer</u>, </b>36 Ill.2d 438, 223 N.E.2d 128 (1967);<b> <u>Brown v.

Inc. v. Ind. Com.</u>,</b> 88 Ill.2d 392 (1981). Either subject-matter
jurisdiction exists, or it doesn't.</tt>
<p><tt>If subject-matter jurisdiction is denied, it must be proved by the
party claiming that the court has subject-matter jurisdiction as to all
of the requisite elements of subject-matter jurisdiction. A partial list
of the elements in which the Court is without subject-matter jurisdiction
and all of its orders/judgments are void are: (1) no Petition in the record
of the case,<b> <u>Brown v. VanKeuren</u>,</b> 340 Ill. 118, 122 (1930),
(2) defective Petition filed,<b> <u>Brown v. VanKeuren</u>,</b> 340 Ill.
118, 122 (1930), (3) fraud committed in the procurement of jurisdiction,<b><u>Fredman
Brothers Furniture v. Dept. of Revenue</u>,</b> 109 Ill.2d 202, 486 N.E.2d
893 (1985), (4) fraud upon the court,<b> <u>In re Village of Willowbrook</u>,</b>
37 Ill.App.3d 393 (1962), (5) a judge does not follow statutory procedure,<b><u>Armstrong
v. Obucino</u>,</b> 300 Ill. 140, 143 (1921), (6) unlawful activity of
a judge,
<u>Code of Judicial Conduct</u>,(7) violation of due process,<b><u>Johnson

<b><u>Hallberg

its statutory authority,<b><u>Rosenstiel v. Rosenstiel</u>,</b> 278 F.Supp.
794 (S.D.N.Y. 1967), (9) any acts in violation of 11 U.S.C. &sect;362(a),<b><u>In

Williams</u>,</b> 264 Ill.App.3d 701, 637 N.E.2d 633 (1st Dist. 1994),
(11) where a complaint states no cognizable cause of action against that
party,<b> <u>Charles v. Gore</u>, </b>248 Ill.App.3d 441, 618 N.E.2d 554
(1st Dist. 1993), (12) where any litigant was represented before a court
by a person/law firm that is prohibited by law to practice law in that
jurisdiction, (13) when the judge is involved in a scheme of bribery (the
<b><u>Alemann</u></b>

when the Local Rules of the Domestic Relations Division, Cook County, Illinois
are not complied with, (18) where the judge does not act impartially,<b>
<u>Bracey v. Warden</u>,</b> U.S. Supreme Court No. 96-6133 (June 9, 1997),
(19) where the statute is vague,<b><u>People v. Williams</u>,

by the movant, <b><u>Wilson v. Moore</u>,</b> 13 Ill.App.3d 632, 301 N.E.2d
39 (1st Dist. 1973), (21) where an order/judgment is based on a void order/judgment,<b><u>Austin

72 Ill.App.3d 736, 393 N.E.2d 18 (1st Dist. 1979), or (22) where the public
policy of the State of Illinois is violated,<b> <u>Martin-Tregona v. Roderick</u>,</b>
29 Ill.App.3d 553, 331 N.E.2d 100 (1st Dist. 1975).</tt>
<p><tt>All of the above elements must be met before the court is conferred
with subject-matter jurisdiction. Should any element not be complied with,
the judge is without subject-matter jurisdiction; his/her orders and judgments
are void, of no legal force or effect<b>.</b></tt>
<p><tt>Should the judge not have subject-matter jurisdiction, then the
law states that the judge has not only violated the law, but is also a
trespasser of the law.<b> <u>Von Kettler et.al. v. Johnson</u>, </b>57
Ill. 109 (1870) ("if the magistrate has not such jurisdiction, then he
and those who advise and act with him, or execute his process, are trespassers.");<b><u>Elliott

authority, its judgments and orders are regarded as nullities. They are
not voidable, but simply void; and form no bar to a recovery sought, even
prior to a reversal in opposition to them. They constitute no justification;
and all persons concerned in executing such judgments or sentences, are
considered, in law, as trespassers. This distinction runs through all the
cases on the subject; and it proves, that the jurisdiction of any court
exercising authority over a subject, may be inquired into in every court,
when the proceedings of the former are relied on and brought before the
latter, by the party claiming the benefit of such proceedings.")<b>; <u>In
re TIP-PA-HANS Enterprises, Inc.</u>, </b>27 B.R. 780, 783 (1983) (a judge

that jurisdiction over the subject matter exists") (when a judge acts "outside
the limits of his jurisdiction, he becomes a trespasser ... ".) ("... courts
have held that where courts of special or limited jurisdiction exceed their
rightful powers, the whole proceeding is coram non judice ... ").</tt>
<p><tt><b><u>Trespasser</u></b> is defined in Black's Law Dictionary (6th
Edition) as one who has committed unlawful interference with one's person,
