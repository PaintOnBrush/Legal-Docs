style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">The second court order 
 below dismisses a case, with prejudice, brought by the Santa Fe, New Mexico 
 police department against a Citizen who voluntarily surrendered his "driver's 
 license", his registration and insurance to the state Motor Vehicle Department 
 and freed himself from the fraudulent, deceptive and unilateral contract 
imposed  upon him, under color of law, and one lacking full disclosure. Several 
months  later he was arrested, his truck confiscated, and criminal charges were 
filed  against him. Because of the Constitutional methods used, the tow truck 
operator,  who had been warned by the police not to return the truck until the 
Citizen  produced a driver's license, registration and insurance, returned the 
truck to  the Citizen, against the firm orders of the police.</FONT></SPAN></P>

then  the case would not have been dismissed, with prejudice, and the Citizen 
would  have been fined and/or jailed. He was not. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is  one of the few cases in the Country in which an unrepresented Citizen 
has  prevailed in court against the massive fraud being perpetrated upon 
Citizens  throughout this Nation, by the licensing, registration and insurance 
fraud being  mandated by government, in defiance of the Constitution and without 
 Constitutional authority.</FONT></SPAN></P>

my friends are self-created types who work for  themselves, as this is also my 
lifestyle. Having made a living since the age of  17 as a sign maker and graphic 
designer, has enabled me to appreciate the  freedoms my lonely schedule affords 
me, and I have attracted similar life-styled  friends who are fiercely 
independent and curious as to the workings of our  government and encroachments 
upon their rights. It is my impression that  individuals who remain employed 
throughout their lives are less likely to have  the time to study, question, or 
oppose authority.</SPAN></FONT></P>

 original intent of our nation is that We The People ARE the authority. All

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><FONT 
face="Times New Roman"><SPAN style="font-size: 14pt;">In my studies I learned 
 many years ago that the driving code is commercial in nature. I obtained my 
 first drivers license at the age of 14 after completing a drivers training 
class  at Roswell High and have been a licensed driver until </SPAN><SPAN style="font-size: 14pt;">July 
26, 2004</SPAN><SPAN style="font-size: 14pt;">. On  that day, I visited the New 
Mexico Motor Vehicle Division headquarters in  </SPAN><SPAN style="font-size: 14pt;">Santa 
Fe</SPAN><SPAN style="font-size: 14pt;"> and returned my license, registrations, 
license plates,  Certificates of Title, and anything else that had the word MVD 
printed upon it.  I requested the secretary to print out the latest summary of 
my "Client History"  which defined me as a "Non-Driver" with one surrender and 
no  violations.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">By law, the only 
 individuals who are required to license themselves and their vehicles are those 
 who are involved in the commercial activity of transporting goods or paying 
 passengers for a living. We The People have a Right to own the cars we have 
 purchased and travel upon the public Right of Way. However, it has been written 
 since the times of horse and buggy that the commercial activity of 
 transportation shall be a regulated privilege. "The right of the citizen to 
 travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, either 
by  carriage or by automobile, is not a mere privilege which a city may prohibit 
or  permit at will, but a common law right which he has under the right to life, 
 liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Thomas v. Smith, 154 SE 
 579.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">In my meeting with the 
 directors of the MVD, I opened the books of laws defining these commercial 
 activities and read aloud certain passages describing jurisdiction and intent. 
I  asked the directors if they could prove anywhere, in written law, that the 
 Citizen must relinquish his right to travel and subvert that freedom into a 
 paid-for privilege. The directors were unable to interject any proof at all 
 except to say I am welcome to my opinions. I was reading from a page titled 
 "Definitions" and I pointed out that the title atop this page wasn't 
"Opinions."  From New Mexico Administrative Code Title 18, section <A href="http://18.2.3.12/">18.2.3.12</A>, 
is the definition "Driving of Motor  Vehicles": "The department of public safety 
hereby adopts Part 392 of Title 49  of the Federal Regulations with no 
amendments." I offered the page from 49 CFR  392 for them to peruse, which 
begins with the headline: "Driving of Commercial  Motor Vehicles." At that 
point, the directors went silent and I told them I  would return the following 
Monday and close my account.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><FONT

 was detained in a traffic stop by a </SPAN><SPAN style="font-size: 14pt;">Santa 
 Fe</SPAN><SPAN style="font-size: 14pt;"> police officer whose probable cause 
for  stopping me was her observation that there was no license plate on my 
pickup  truck. I showed this officer an Affidavit, executed on the day of July 
24th,  attesting to the items returned to the MVD. I showed the officer the 
printout  from the MVD database of my status as a non-driver. And, I produced 
the same  definitions from Title 18 and the Code of Federal Regulations I 
mentioned in the  previous paragraph.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">This officer was confused 
 and unable to reach a decision without calling her commanding officer, and this 
 other fellow arrived shortly thereafter. He read over the same facts, laws, and 
 evidence, and ordered that my truck should be towed away, and held in ransom, 
 until I became, once again, a participant within the commercial driving codes 
 defined by Title 18. At the moment the front wheels of my truck were lifting 
off  the ground, the original officer said, "So, tell me some more about your 
 rights." I replied, "These are your rights, too, but you told me earlier that 
 you didn't want to hear anything about the Constitution or my rights." She 
 replied, "Yeah.... that's correct."</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><FONT

 Sheriff Greg Solano to inform him of this attack upon my rights and my 
property.  The Sheriff, in </SPAN><SPAN 
style="font-size: 14pt;">America</SPAN><SPAN style="font-size: 14pt;">, is the 
only elected police officer, and he has the  authority, and duty, to protect and 
defend his citizenry against all enemies,  foreign and domestic. The Sheriff has 
the authority and power to eject any agent  from any federal agency operating 
without court ordered warrant, be it FBI, CIA,  IRS, ATF, ICE, or any other 
problematic initials, that are operating within the  boundaries of his county 
jurisdiction.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">Every phone call to my 
 sheriff went unanswered. Over the next two weeks, I wrote the sheriff two 
 letters. In a written letter to me, Sheriff Solano replied, "... until such 
time  as a court of law rules that citizens may declare themselves sovereign, I 
cannot  act to assist you in this matter. As you well know, I am sworn to uphold 
the  constitution and the laws of the federal, state, and local governments. As 
part  of that responsibility, I must rely on court rulings on matters such as 
 yours."</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">We The People created the 
 Sheriff. We created the courts. We create the judges. And there is no court 
that  has the authority to determine if we are sovereign, or not. Sheriff Solano 
wrote  that he must uphold ALL laws. The lawful definition of a law officer is 
the  first paragraph to NMSA 29 (New Mexico Statutes Annotated), titled "Law 
 Enforcement." It reads, "29-1-1. It is hereby declared to be the duty of every 
 sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable and every other peace officer to investigate 
 all violations of the criminal laws of the state which are called to the 
 attention of any such officer or of which he is aware, and it is also declared 
 the duty of every such officer to diligently file a complaint or information, 
if  the circumstances are such as to indicate to a reasonably prudent person 
that  such action should be taken, and it is also declared to be his duty to 
cooperate  with and assist the attorney general, district attorney or other 
prosecutor, if  any, in all reasonable ways. Failure to perform his duty in any 
material way  shall subject such officer to removal from office and payment of 
all costs of  prosecution."</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">It was 30 days later when 
 my truck was returned to me. The third letter I wrote to the tow truck 
operator,  apprising him of his criminal activity of accepting stolen property, 
under the  lawless orders of the Santa Fe Police Department, and their likely 
unwillingness  to pay for his defense in an upcoming civil trial, convinced the 
man that it  would be best to remove this truck from his possession. Not knowing 
when my  property would be returned, I had to buy another truck, as I live 
almost 15  miles from Santa Fe, and I had no practical means to work, or buy 
food, or  attend to my affairs. I need to work, to earn money, however, driving 
to work is  not a commercial activity. If my only activity was transporting 
signs, then I  would be involved in commercial transportation. Driving to work, 
the grocery  store, or bringing a bowl of soup to your grandmother is your 
 right.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">But... is it really MY 
 truck? When you go to a car dealership, and if you pay the entire amount, no 
 financing through a bank or loan company, you are given the "Title of Origin" 
or  "Manufacturer's Statement of Origin." This is the true title to the car. The 
car  manufacturer builds the car and owns this property until it is delivered to 
the  car dealership. The car and "MSO" is handed over, for the wholesale 
payment, and  now, the dealership owns the car. If the customer purchases the 
car with full  payment, he is given possession of the car and the perfect title, 
the  MSO.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">Unwittingly, that 
 individual seeks out the nearest MVD office, hands over the perfect title in 
 exchange for the MVD fabricated "Certificate of Title", it says "MVD" right on 
 it, and now THE STATE OWNS YOUR CAR in a commercial privilege defined as 
 "driving." Your full compliance is met when you attach a license plate, with 
 registration sticker, to the bumper, and you carry the drivers license on your 
 person.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">This is what gives the 
cops  the authority to have your car towed away, because, in reality, the state 
owns  your car. If somebody shoves a gun in your face and demands your wallet, 
that is  called "robbery." If your property or your money has been stolen away 
without  your knowledge or consent, that is called "conversion." To have been 
duped into  a situation where you unwittingly waive your rights and ownership of 
property  and convert those precious belongings into paid-for privilege, is 
"fraud." To be  held before a judge, or by armed police, and to be forced to pay 
fines or suffer  imprisonment, is "coercion", "racketeering", and "extortion." I 
have brought  charges against 34 individuals, working within the machinery of 
government of  the State of New Mexico, and I will say more about that 
later.</FONT></SPAN></P>

 appeared at the Santa Fe Municipal Court for a pre-trial hearing to review the 
 charges brought against me during that traffic stop in September. The 
 prosecuting attorney for the City of Santa Fe, Art Michael, was stunned when I 
 described to him that there was no nexus connecting me to the New Mexico MVD. 
 Mr. Michael asked me if he may shake my hand. I allowed this and he said, "You 
 are the first person, ever, to come in here and tell me this." All charges 
 against me, no license, no registration, no insurance, were dismissed, with

style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">On June 23, 2005, I was 
 detained late one evening when a New Mexico State Police officer observed that 
 one of my headlights was defective. Only minutes earlier, I became aware of the 
 headlight, and was turning my brights on, and off, when other cars neared, and 
 was intent on returning home and fixing this light immediately. This traffic 
 stop resulted in three citations, once again, for the identical charges listed 
 above. However, considering me walking home several miles in the dark, the 
 officer waived the truck being towed. In the ensuing months leading to a trial 
 by jury, I mailed the state cop so much information regarding the fraudulent 
 nature of the MVD, and his own upcoming performance at my trial to testify 
 against me, that this individual quit the police and became a security 
 guard.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><SPAN 
style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">I requested specifically 
 that my rights to a trial by jury be secured, and this was granted by the 
 presiding judge, Sandra Miera. However, as the trial approached, I asked the 
 judge to certify a subpoena that called for Santa Fe Prosecuting Attorney Art 
 Michael to appear and testify on my behalf. I wanted Mr. Michael to describe to 
 the jury how he dismissed the identical charges now brought against me once 
 again, in my previous appearance at the Santa Fe Municipal 
 Court.</FONT></SPAN></P>

style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">When Judge Miera was 
 presented with the subpoena to certify, she recused herself from the case. And 
 within minutes, the case was reassigned to Judge George Anaya, but right to 
 trial by jury was subverted to a "hearing." A hearing is a judicial venue in 
 which your fate is decided by only one person, a judge. The word "hearing" does 
 not appear in the Constitution, because of its biased and unfair nature, and 
the  framers of our Constitution underlined that only true and fair due process 
of  law could be met within a trial by jury. </FONT></SPAN></P>

 hearing regarding arraignment for my second incident was conducted at the Santa 
 Fe County Magistrate Court. The entire affair ended in less than 30 seconds 
when  Judge Anaya dismissed all charges, with prejudice. "Dismissed with 
prejudice"  means that the matter has been put to rest, forever, with no grounds 
to ever  open or re-examine again. Dismissed "without" prejudice leaves the case 
 vulnerable for further controversy.</FONT></SPAN></P>

 September 22, 2006, I was near the plaza in Santa Fe and had just locked my 
 truck and was walking away when a Santa Fe police officer drove up and 
 announced, "Hey... you were not wearing a seat belt." I asked him, "Isn't it a 
 bit late to be discussing whether I was wearing a seat belt or not?" He didn't 
 answer that question but asked to see all of my credentials. When I told him 
 where my credentials went, and how long ago, the officer retreated to his 
police  cruiser to confer with headquarters on the radio. Whoever he was 
speaking with  told him to not issue any tickets, only warnings. The "warning" 
section of the  traffic citation states that you are admitting that laws have 
been violated, but  there will be no fines issued or court dates to meet. I 
refused to admit that I  had broken any laws and signed "All Rights Reserved" 
just before my  signature.</FONT></SPAN></P>

 described the many facts, laws, and evidence I have acquired regarding the 
 jurisdiction of "driving", which is defined in every state as "driving a 
 commercial motor vehicle." The only individuals required to hold a drivers 
 license are those involved in the commercial transportation of goods or paying 
 passengers. This reality has been underlined by over 100 Supreme Court cases, 
 federal and state, upholding and protecting our Right to Travel. In July 2004, 
I  closed my account at MVD when I surrendered every item fabricated by that 
agency  and received proof from their official data base of that transaction. 
Since  then, I have incurred great expenses, losses, and inconvenience, however, 
I knew  that I would encounter many obstacles on the road back to Our

style="font-size: 14pt;"><FONT face="Times New Roman">In preparing a body of 
 evidence that could be used in a court of law to prove my case, I began issuing 
 a series of letters addressed to my public servants. The First Amendment to the 
 Constitution states, in part, ... "Congress shall make no law prohibiting the 
 right of the people to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." I 
 wrote several letters, and finally, affidavits, explaining the jurisdiction of 
 commercial traffic code, and how I had ended all contracts with the MVD, and 
the  ensuing events that unfolded. These letters and affidavits were addressed 
to the  Governor, the entire Supreme Court, the Attorney General, Secretary of 
State,  Speaker of the House, Senate Pro Tem, Director of MVD, Secretary of 
Taxation &amp; Revenue, Mayor of Santa Fe, all city counselors, Chief of Police, 
 arresting officers, and several other individuals working within their personal

 specified individually to notify and remind that public official of their 
 personal connectedness to the machinery of government, and their duty and oath, 
 which would enable them to receive a complaint, and then rectify the problem. 
 The letters, and then affidavits, were a primer of facts, laws, and evidence 
 that would inform that official of the specific nature of the commercial 
driving  code, and the sovereign Citizen's Right to Travel as a guaranteed life 
right,  and not a paid-for privilege.</FONT></SPAN></P>
