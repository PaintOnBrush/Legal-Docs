      <P align="left">Read US v. Lopez and Hagans v. Levine both void because of 
      lack of jurisdiction. In Lopez the circuit court called it right, and in 
      Hagans it had to go to the Supreme court before it was called right, in 
      both cases, void. Challenge jurisdiction and motion to dismiss, right off 
      the bat. If you read the supreme Court cases you will find that 
      jurisdiction can be challenged at any time and in the case of Lopez it was 
      a jury trial which was declared void for want of jurisdiction. If it 
      [jurisdiction] doesn't exist, it can not justify conviction or judgment. 
      ...without which power (jurisdiction) the state CANNOT be said to be 
      "sovereign." At best, to proceed would be in "excess" of jurisdiction 
      which is as well fatal to the State's/ USA 's cause. Broom v. Douglas, 75 
      Ala 268, 57 So 860 the same being jurisdictional facts FATAL to the 
      government's cause ( e.g. see In re FNB, 152 F 64). </P>
