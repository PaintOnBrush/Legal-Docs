       1234 Constitution Blvd,

From:   A living man/woman,
              Christian name
              c/o address
              City, state

To whom it may concern,

Let it be known as a matter of public record the following facts:


  I, __________ of the ________ family, am a natural free living man/woman on the land in this territory known as _________, one of the several states of the American Republic . I am a free-born inhabitant of the land, a Divine Child of the Creator.  I do not submit to any foreign jurisdictional authority operating in the air or water, under Private International Law.  I do not understand that law nor it's language. It is foreign to me. 

   I, ____________ of the ________ family, RESERVE ALL of my fundamental natural, universal and common law RIGHTS, at all times in all places and I WAIVE NO RIGHTS at any time or in any place.  I remove myself from the unjust provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code and other commercial codes which  are contradictory to or not in harmony with my rights and justice. 

 I present the following facts and challenges:                     

   
   I, __________, am NOT the 'artificial PERSON', (insert: *ALL CAPS NAME*), appearing on these charges.  It does not state my Christian name anywhere upon or therein. It only lists the NAME of a LEGAL FICTION, created by the STATE of ________, as the defendent.  I am NOT that legal fiction. I am NOT that all-capital letter NAME appearing as surety on any bond such as the Birth Certificate. I am the Beneficiary, a living breathing soul created by God the Creator, commonly known as _________ of the __________ family.
   God alone created me and by "Right of Creation", He alone controls me. It is the nature of Law that what one creates, one controls.

[Bovier's Law Dictionary, 8th ed., pg. 2287 reads:
 "The omission of one's Christian name by either plaintiff or defendant in a legal process prevents the court from acquiring jurisdiction, …"]

  Please note the following Supreme Court ruling: 
"In as much as every government is an artificial person, an abstraction, and a creature of the mind only, a government can interface only with other artificial persons. The imaginary, having neither actuality nor substance, is foreclosed from creating and attaining parity with the tangible. The legal manifestation of this is that no government, as well as any law, agency, aspect, court, etc. can concern itself with anything other than corporate, artificial persons and the contracts between them." (Doan's Administrators vs. Penhallow, 3 U.S. 54; 1 L.Ed. 57; 3 Dall. 54, Supreme Court of the United States 1795)

   I am surrendering the PERSON and Birth Certificate to the ______________ Court and waive the benefits so that this matter and all others may be discharged and settled.
   I do not consent to be a commercial bond slave or indentured servant for this foreign court to register as a commodity for it's investment system (C.R.I.S.).

 If I am being charged with a crime:

* Whereas: I am under the authority of natural, universal law and the commonlaw of the free sovereign people of the land, which is based upon justice, truth, and reason, and defines crime as an act which harms another's being or property...  
 
* Whereas: no injured party has come forward with any accusation and evidence of harm done to their person or property...
 
* Whereas: the prosecuting BAR attorney (a member of a foreign union) has no firsthand knowledge of any alleged damages caused by me...

 ...therefore, I have committed no crime of which to be charged and the prosecution has no standing to take action against me.

{"To establish one's standing to bring an action, a party must demonstrate: (1) that it has sustained a distinct and palpable injury, (2) that the injury was caused by the challenged conduct, and (3) that the injury is apt to be redressed by a remedy the court is prepared to give. City of Chattanooga v. Davis, 54 S.W3d 248, 280 (Tenn, 2001)}

  I challenge the prosecuting attorneys to produce such a victim, or enter into evidence a verified complaint by a party injured by my alleged actions.  I deny any victim exists. Under common law of the free people: 'no victim, no crime'. 

Also note that:

 *Whereas: 27. C.F.R. 72.11 ..Subpart B_Defines Commercial crimes... 
"Any of the following types of crimes (Federal or State): Offenses against the revenue laws; burglary; counterfeiting; forgery; kidnapping; larceny; robbery; illegal sale or possession of deadly weapons; prostitution (including soliciting, procuring, pandering, white slaving, keeping house of ill fame, and like offenses); extortion; swindling and confidence games; and attempting to commit, conspiring to commit, or compounding any of the foregoing crimes. Addiction to narcotic drugs and use of marihuana will be treated as if such were commercial crime."...

 *Whereas: I deny that I am a commercial entity or corporation, but declare that I am a living woman on the land, a Divine Child of the Creator...

  *Whereas: I am not an employee or agent of your corporation, I am not a member of your military, I am not a 'commercial driver for hire' and I have not contracted to do business with you... 

   ...therefore I am not lawfully bound to your policies or statutes of commerce legislated under a corporate flag and operating under Private International commercial Law. It is not possible for me, a free living non-commercial entity, to commit a 'commercial crime'.

If I am charged with a civil matter:

  Let it also be known as a matter of public record that...

 I, ________, a free living man/woman on the land, do not consent to contract with your corporation and that any contract entered into by me under duress, fraud by non-disclosure of it's true intent, or threat of violence, or any agreement made by me while in a mental or emotional state that rendered me incapable of making a sound conscious choice to do so, is hereby rescinded and is null and void of any force, without prejudice.

  A lawful contract is between consenting parties agreeing to ALL terms with full disclosure, and without coersion, threats or duress.

  I challenge the prosecuting attorney to produce a lawfully binding contract, signed by me, knowingly and willingly surrendering my Natural, unalienable rights and Divine Birthrights, including the right to travel, compelling my submission to the false authority of your commercial legal system. 

{Butler v. Collins, 12 Calif., 157. 463. ”Consent in law is more than mere formal act of the mind. It is an act unclouded by fraud, duress, or sometimes even mistake.”} 

  I, __________,  hereby challenge the _________________Court, the prosecuting attorneys, or other officers of the court to provide the legal document that gives agents of a fictional Corporation  lawful authority, commonlaw jurisdiction, or ownership of a free living people of the Constitutional Republic known as the united states of America. I deny such proof exists. To claim such authority would be a violation of Common Law of the free Sovereign People as well as the 13th Amendment to the Constitution for the united states of America.

{"Once jurisdiction is challenged, the court cannot proceed when it clearly appears that the court lacks jurisdiction, the court has no authority to reach merits, but, rather, should dismiss the action." Melo v. US, 505 F2d 1026.} 

 UNITED STATES is a federal Corporation, with the STATE of __________ being an incorporated subsidiary of that corporation. I do not understand how  I, the natural living woman, can be a 'citizen' of a Corporation.  I dwell on this Earth, under sole authority and judgment of God and of my Lord Jesus Christ. I have a God-given right to travel on the public roadways and conduct my own affairs without interference from the corporate STATE.

  Because I am a non-corporate entity and I am not registered with any
Secretary of State as a CORPORATION, the Prosecution has FAILED to state a claim to which relief can be granted under FRCP 12(b) (6)....  therefore this matter must be dismissed for lack of political, personam, and subject matter jurisdiction.


 * Delivery and filing of this notice with the Clerk of ______________ Court shall not be construed as consent to jurisdiction.

  With Reservation of All Rights, Remedies and Applicable Treaties, without prejudice UCC 1-308,
