a citizen of the United States and a resident of California. In December, 1939, he left his home in\
Marysville, California, for Spur, Texas, with the intention of bringing back to Marysville, his wife\'s brother,\
Frank Duncan, a citizen of the United States and a resident of Texas. [314 U.S. 160, 171] When he\
arrived in Texas, appellant learned that Duncan had last been employed by the Works Progress\
Administration. Appellant thus became aware of the fact that Duncan was an indigent person and he\
continued to be aware of it throughout the period involved in this case. The two men agreed that appellant\
should transport Duncan from Texas to Marysville in appellant\'s automobile. Accordingly, they left Spur on\
January 1, 1940, entered California by way of Arizona on January 3, and reached Marysville on January 5.\
When he left Texas, Duncan had about $20. It had all been spent by the time he reached Marysville. He\
lived with appellant for about ten days until he obtained financial assistance from the Farm Security\
Administration. During the ten day interval, he had no employment. </p>\
<p>1. In Justice Court a complaint was filed against appellant under Section 2615 of the Welfare and\
Institutions Code of California, St.1937, p. 1406, which provides: \'Every person, firm or corporation, or\
officer or agent thereof that brings or assists in bringing into the State any indigent person who is not a\
resident of the State, knowing him to be an indigent person, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\' On demurrer to\
the complaint, appellant urged that the Section violated several provisions of the Federal Constitution. The\
demurrer was overruled, the cause was tried, appellant was convicted and sentenced to six months\
imprisonment in the county jail, and sentence was suspended. On appeal to U.S. Supreme Court,\
Edwards won.</p>\

style="COLOR: #000000">Doug, I will be obtaining a copy of my court transcript 
from today's court appearance, which I will be submitting to you to do as you 
please. Permission is granted if you want to post it. I argued my defense today. 
The judge did not want to reopen the case, but I kept pressing him that the case 
should be reopened because there was a fraud committed on the court by the 
officer. He eventually granted the prosecution 60 days to respond to the briefs 
I had submitted to the court, and granting me 30 days to respond to the response 
from the prosecutor. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

style="COLOR: #000000">I left the courtroom and went to my car. I then realized 
that I had left my coat in the courtroom. I returned and was handed my coat by a 
deputy. As I was about to leave, the judge requested that I wait a minute, as 
another case was in session. He than recalled my case, and had a deputy sheriff 
come behind the bench. He proceeded to talk to the officer holding his hand to 
his mouth so that I could not hear the conversation. He than made a comment that 
in reviewing the citation, the officer did not put a speed on the ticket 
regarding the pace of the automobile, and than asked the prosecutor if that was 
a necessary requirement, as if he didn't already know. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

Staples received a speeding ticket while driving his automobile on a straight 
level high speed freeway in Wisconsin during daylight and perfect driving 
weather. The ticket does not say how fast Paul was driving. The policeman cannot 
know because the policeman had to speed up to an unsafe speed (for this 
policeman - not for Paul). Paul is a very safe driver having driven many miles 
as a professional truck driver. Paul has never had a crash in all those 
miles.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

grew up in rural Wisconsin and has been driving since age 18. He passed the 
driving test and has been driving without incident for all of his life. In 
recent years, Paul concluded logically that a driver license is not a legal 
prerequisite to driving his car. Paul, like many legally educated Americans, has 
studied history and can see the stealthy encroachment. Paul dislikes the police 
mentality and the police state.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

officer inquired of Paul without issuing a Miranda warning despite his obvious 
focus on Paul as the subject of a criminal prosecution. He intended to pursue a 
criminal case against Paul if the results of his fishing expedition proved 
fruitful. He should have shared that information with Paul in the form of a 
Miranda warning. Police now intend to use Paul’s statements against 
him.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

court has thus far trampled on Paul’s rights. Although his intent was to argue 
the legal issues, the court simply ignored those issues and entered a plea for 
him, thus attempting to deny his due process. Paul now demands his full panoply 
of procedural due process including the time-honored right to litigate the legal 
before making a plea. And on that note, to the extent that the court does not so 
advise lay persons, like Paul, of this matter, the court denies Paul due process 
- a basis for immediate dismissal. It is likely that the court in fact advises 
Paul incorrectly on matters of his rights; all courts do. You can’t give Paul 
back the time that he has spent on this case. You are taking away days from his 
life. Corporations like the prosecutor live forever and don’t care about wasted 
time. Paul does care.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

Douglas Palaschak, declare the following under penalty of perjury: I remember. I 
was raised on a grand corn and soybean farm in Illinois. When I was age 9, each 
of my Grandfathers owned a grain truck. Both trucks said the same thing on the 
side: “Not for hire”. I pondered this strange message for many years. Why would 
you not hire your truck out? Why make an issue of it before anybody even asks? 
The answer seemed to be that if you hired out your truck then you became subject 
to a higher tax on the truck. In fact to this day there is a rule, perhaps 
unwritten, that a farmer may drive his truck to the nearest grain elevator just 
as he may drive his tractor and wagon, to wit: without regard for licenses on 
the driver or the truck - because none are needed for the tractor and wagon 
hauling corn in from the field.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

drove a grain truck again on the farm in the harvests of 1996, 1997, and 1998. I 
drove it without a driver license for a truck, and, as I recall, the trucks, or 
at least one of them was not currently registered. That is how the issue arose.

by the Motor Vehicles Department (licensor), which may be implied or expressed

to erect curtains, screens, or other obstructions on their premises due to the 
terms of the license. It matters not where these terms were directly stated to 
the licensee or stated in the rules and regulations that cover such licensed 
businesses, the licensee still becomes subject to the terms of the license. 
There can be no argument that such terms are unreasonable as the licensor is in

any argument that such terms are in violation of one’s rights has no legal

that would otherwise conflict with the terms of the license. The licensor has 
the authority over the thing being licensed therefore his term must prevail over 
the rights of the licensee and out of respect of the licensor’s right to control 
the thing or act. Thus, the rights of the licensee are limited by the terms of 
the license.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

use of roads for travel is a very ancient practice. The right to travel upon 
them has been recognized since the early Roman Empire. This right to freely 
travel as an attribute of personal liberty was so basic and fundamental in early 
America that it never became the subject matter of colonial legislation. Not 
even under the tyranny of King George III was the right to travel suppressed. 
Liberty was recognized and secured by all of the original state constitutions. 
Before Wisconsin became a state and also thereafter, its citizens possessed this 
liberty and right to travel. The Constitution of Wisconsin when adopted secured 
this inalienable right to liberty, locomotion, or travel on the public 
ways.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

meaning and original intent of the State Constitution and recognize only current 
statutes set by quasi legislation, is not only being legally nearsighted but is 
a gross violation of their oath of office. As a result the trial court/tribunal 
gravely erred in its decision. The liberty to travel and to move from place to 
place, which existed under the common law, and which existed in colonial 
America, also exists under the State Constitutions. The “liberty” in the 
Constitution secures the same rights it included at common law and meaning the 
same thing-a right to travel”</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

conclusion: If traveling per se is an inalienable and constitutional right, and 
if the automobiles has “equal rights” with the older forms of travel such as on 
foot or horseback, the logical deduction here is that traveling by way of an 
automobile on a public way is a constitutional, inalienable, and fundamental 
right:</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

rights that the people inherently possessed when the original colonies were 
founded, were secured by the Constitution of Wisconsin when adopted. The right 
to freely travel, by what ever means available, on public ways is an ancient 
right. The people who adopted the Constitution certainly did not “surrender” 
their liberty to freely travel. In fact they made sure that the Constitution 
would “secure the same to ourselves and our posterity.” This is the main reason

it constitutionally does not exist. It has been held by a sister State,

right to travel on the land was an inherent right, which had existed before the 
adoption of Wisconsin’s Constitution. This right includes all modes of travel, 
whether by horse, wagon, or carriage, or by walking, and also includes 
automobiles since they have “equal rights” with other modes of travel. Thus, the 
defendant is here again claiming and asserting his inalienable and 
constitutional right to travel on the public roads of this land, whether on 
foot, or by bicycle, or automobile or other means of conveyance existing or yet 
to be discovered. This is a right under the Constitution of Wisconsin and every 
state, which this court is bound to uphold and protect.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

Minnesota Supreme Court had pointed out this principle by showing that “A person 
riding a bicycle upon the public highways has the same rights in so doing as 
persons using other vehicles thereon.” It also pointed out that an older form of 
travel, “has no right superior” to the more modern forms of conveyance because 
“the rights of each are equal.” Thus, the legislature cannot make it unlawful 
for a citizen to travel on the public highways when using an automobile (or a 
light weight pick-up vehicle use for personal conveyance, not for gain) by 
compelling one to take out a “driver’s license,” thereby stating it is unlawful 
to travel in that mode and putting a burden one not on other 
Americans.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

ordinance, so far as it obliges appellee to take out a license before he can use 
his own automobile in his own business or for his own pleasure, is beyond the 
power of the city counsel, and is therefore void. City of Chicago v. Banker, 112

thus does not come under the purview of any Wisconsin statute to the contrary.

cannot possibly grant to any person a right to travel on the public roads; we 
each have that right. It is an inherent right of everybody who is geographically

“the individuals ordinary right to the free use of the streets” for travel 
“cannot be taken from him” See State v. McCarthy, 171 So. 314, 316 (Fla.-1936).

the public roads for business or personal gain have no inherent right to use the

the usual and ordinary right of a citizen, a common right, a right common to 
all, while the latter is special, unusual and extraordinary. As to the former, 
the extent of legislative power is that of regulation; but, as to the latter, 
its power is broader, the right may be wholly denied, or it may be permitted to

Appellant, prior to his arrest, was traveling in his Toyota, a 1989, on the 
public roads in Wisconsin by common law right, and thus having equal rights with 
other travelers, such as pedestrians, bicyclists, horse and carriages, etc., all 
of which have an inalienable right of free passage on the public road. 
Therefore, the defendant needs no license to obtain a right (free passage on a 
public road) he already possesses. The State cannot compel the Appellant to 
acquire a license before he is allowed to exercise his constitutional right of 
liberty and to travel. This same principle holds true regarding the exercise of 
all constitutional rights there can be no license required before they are 
allowed to be exercised. For instance, in a case regarding the right of freedom 
of the press, the United States Supreme Court held that a law, which prohibits 
the distribution of printing materials except by license, is invalid. The Court

induced its adoption, its character is such that it strikes at the very 
foundation of the freedom of the press by subjection it to license and 
censorship. The struggle for the freedom of the press was primarily directed 
against the power of the licensor. It was against that power that John Milton 
directed his assault by his “Appeal for the Liberty of Unlicenced Printers.”

Chicago, 337 Ill. 200, 206), licensing is inconsistent with proper regulation of 
a right. This lower court/tribunal apparently believes this Appellant is 
required to have a license, making the assumption that since the legislature has 
the authority to establish reasonable regulations for common travel, it also has 
the power to license it. This, of course, is a false assumption. The following 
holdings will correct this incorrect assumption at the 
heartland.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

the power to regulate confer the right to license? We think not...We discover 
that to license and to regulate do not require the exercise of the same power, 
and the same objects are not attained by the acts authorized, and this being 
settled leads to the conclusion that the first cannot be exercised under 
authority to do the last. See The City of Burlington v. Bumgardner, 42 Iowa 673,

power to regulate does not necessarily include the power to license. In passing 
on the question of whether in a particular case the power to regulate includes 
the power to license, it is well to bear in mind the distinction between 
regulation and license. Regulations apply equally to all. A license, however, 
gives to the licensee a special privilege not accorded to others and which he 
himself otherwise would not enjoy. Once a power to license exists, certain acts 
becomes illegal for all who have not been licensed. Village of Brooklyn Center

“act” of traveling in the several states or Wisconsin has never been illegal. 
Nor is the nature of the act such that it can be illegal or regarded as a 
“special privilege.” it would be foolish and unconstitutional to say it is. 
Traveling in this country, regardless of what mode of conveyance used, has never 
been regarded as such because the power to license a citizen for exercising this 
right has never existed. This is because reasonable regulations of an 
inalienable right do not include compelling a citizen to waive his 
constitutional rights by submitting him to licensing, the very nature of which 
subjects the licensee to rules that can be unreasonable or a further trespass on 
his rights. In short, the exercise of an inalienable right cannot be made 
illegal by subjecting a person to a license. Legislative statute or fiat cannot 
change the nature of a constitutional right. The right or liberty to freely 
travel, which had existed when the Constitution of Wisconsin was adopted, exists 
today, as the right is unchangeable:</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

beyond the power of “The State” to apply. The fact that an automobile is now 
being used to exercise this “unchangeable” inherent right to freely travel makes 
no difference in this case because, as previously shown, automobiles and pick-up 
vehicles have the “same right” (House v Cramer, supra) as those modes of travel 
used since the adoption of Wisconsin’s Constitution. Thus, the same legal

uphold the Constitution of Wisconsin as it was written, which it reluctantly 
failed to do in its biased and distorted decision, one which was totally 
unsupported by fact or law. The Appellant can use an automobile/pick-up vehicle 
in his travel with the same freedom and legal right as that which was intended 
under the Constitution of Wisconsin for a man to freely walk or ride his horse 
on the public road. The conditions may change but the meaning of the law does 
not. The trial court had all ignored and evaded the manner of constitutional law 
and rights in its decision. The court was apparently aware that if it had 
applied and upheld the rights and legal principles that were secured and fixed 
by Constitution, that it could never apply any driver’s licensing statutes to 
the Defendant for traveling in his automobile to date. Will this legislative 
court having heard the above avoid the arguments in this matter by twisting them 
out of context, and then stating that the Defendants arguments are not supported 
by case law or statute? While this has been shown to be totally false, it is 
strange that this legislative court has not stated that Constitutional law did 
not support the arguments presented! If such issues were of paramount importance 
why would this legislative court avoid this matter? This legislative court may 
find it necessary to hold the police power of this State as an absolute power 
over the Appellant’s Constitutional, inherent, and unalienable rights. This 
false position may have been necessary for them to take as being the only way 
such licensing legislation could be upheld and applied to the Defendant, not to 
mention giving the police a bear hug. The Appellant’s liberty and inherent right 
to freely travel are paramount over the police powers and cannot be superseded 
by licensing.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

powers of government, under our system, are nowhere absolute. They are but 
grants of authority from the people, and are limited to their true purpose. The 
fundamental rights of the people are inherent and have not been yielded to 
governmental control. They are not the subjects of government authority. They 
are the subjects of individual authority. Constitutional powers can never 
transcend constitutional rights. The police power is subject to the limitations 
imposed by the Constitution upon every power of government; and it will not be 
suffered to invade or impair the fundamental liberties of the citizen, those 
natural rights which are the chief concern of the Constitution and for whose 
protection it was ordained by the people.* * * It [a constitutional right], is 
not a right, therefore, over which the police power is paramount. Like every 
other fundamental liberty, it is a right to which the police power is

the police power is “subordinate” to constitutional rights, the police power 
cannot possibly license (i.e. prohibit, make unlawful, or turn in to a 
privilege) the exercise of such a right, and thereby “transcend” such a right 
and put itself in a superior position. These rights are the most important part 
of the law of the land and such rights are beyond the reach of legislative 
interference. Thus the police power cannot constitutionally license these rights 
because to require a license by statute for the right to travel is to infer that 
the citizen has no inherent, vested or constitutional right to travel. This is 
the argument of the defendant from the very beginning of this case, and one that 
this legislative court has continually evaded and avoided. The driver’s license 
is an unwarranted interference with the Appellant’s fundamental right of travel 
in his automobile.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

rights involved. The administrators of the lower court/tribunal on public safety 
and welfare are actually in itself a false assumption. The first licensing law 
aimed at the private citizen in 1933, was required for a “person” to obtain a 
“driver’s license under this act, was to sign an application stating “that he is 
competent to operate a motor vehicle upon the public highways,” and pay 25 
cents. Thus, the most illiterate and incompetent person could obtain a license. 
Anyone who had a visual, mental, or physical impairment could obtain a license, 
and anyone who was unfamiliar with the rules of the road or had never used an 
automobile could obtain a license. And indeed this did

driver’s license is a typical example of an abridgement of freedom by gradual 
and stealthy encroachments. The IRS is another example. When the Wisconsin 
license law was passed on April 21, 1933 (just a short time after FDR declared 
the United States bankrupt on March 9, 1933), it did not go into effect for 
almost a year latter on March 1, 1934. So even though the law was placed on the 
books, it lay dormant for a year during which time nothing changed in the lives 
of citizens in traveling upon the roads thereby suppressing any immediate 
objections to it. And when it was enacted, history shows it was loosely 
enforced. The continued enforcement of the license is seen today to include 
everything from roadblocks to requiring mandatory seatbelts and insurance. 
Furthermore, the gradual evolution and adoption of “examinations” fourteen years 
after the license law was enacted was necessary because the people had to first 
be lulled into the idea that the State could license their right to travel. 
Where these “examinations” were required at the same time the ‘driver’s license” 
was required, along with its heavy and strict enforcement, mandatory seatbelt, 
mandatory insurance, etc., the people would then have seen it as an obvious and 
sudden usurpation of an inherent right and rebelled against it. Throughout our 
history we have been forewarned of such gradual encroachments upon our 
rights:</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
