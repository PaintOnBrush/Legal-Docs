  <P><SPAN class=italic><I>This chapter provides procedures for processing 
  Payroll Deduction agreements and Direct Debit installment agreements. Payroll 
  deduction agreements are those agreements where employers deduct payments from 
  taxpayer’s wages, and mail them to the Internal Revenue Service. Direct Debit 
  Agreements allow the Service to debit taxpayer's bank accounts. Payroll 
  Deduction agreements and Direct Debit installment agreements benefit the 
  taxpayer by reducing the likelihood of default and lessening taxpayer 
  burden.</I></SPAN> </P></LI></OL></DIV></DIV>

<OL type=1>
  <LI>
  <P>The use of Form 2159, Payroll Deduction Agreement, must be strongly 
  encouraged when the taxpayer is a wage earner, particularly if the taxpayer 
  defaulted on a previous installment agreement. </P>
  <LI>
  <P><B>Private employers, states, and political subdivisions are not required 
  to enter into payroll deduction agreements. Taxpayers should determine whether 
  their employers will accept and process executed agreements before agreements 
  are submitted for approval or finalized.</B> </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Comptroller General decision B–45105 (signed in 1955) requires Federal 
  Agencies to deduct and pay over the amount shown on payroll deduction 
  agreements. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Allow a reasonable period for the employer to complete the necessary 
  bookkeeping and submit the first payment. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>On balance due and ACS accounts, encourage taxpayers to hand deliver 
  agreements to employers; otherwise mail agreements to employers. If taxpayers 
  prefer the Service initiate this contact, it may be made if the taxpayer 
  received Letter 3164 A at least 10 days prior to mailing Form 2159 to the 
  employer. Ensure Form 12175 is completed and forwarded to the Third Party 
  Contact Coordinator in the area or center initiating the contact. Letter 3164 
  A must have been mailed for each module included in the installment agreement. 
  If Letter 3164 A has not been mailed, the taxpayer may authorize a specific 
  third party contact if the revenue officer or other contact employee completes 
  Form 12180 and has it signed by the taxpayer(s). This form should be kept with 
  the case file and the case file history should be documented to reflect the 
  date that the taxpayer provided the authorization. In processing Payroll 
  Deduction Agreements ensure that all Third Party Contact guidelines have been 
  observed. See IRM 5.1.17. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The employer and the taxpayer should sign Form 2159 before submission to 
  the manager for approval. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>On ACS accounts, direct employers responses to ACS call sites, document 
  case files and forward them to call sites after completing telephone contact. 
  </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Ensure TC 971 AC 043 is input on all modules within 24 hours of the 
  taxpayer’s request for a payroll deduction agreement. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>If employers must be contacted during Payroll Deduction Agreements, ensure 
  Letter 3164 A was sent previously, and Form 12175 was completed and properly 
  routed to the Third Party Contact coordinator. (See IRM 5.14.10.2(5).) </P>
  <LI>
  <P>To insure proper remittance and posting, instruct employers, or request 
  taxpayers advise their employers, to show taxpayers' names and TINs, tax 
  form(s) and period(s) on all remittances. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>If an employer requests formal notification from the Collection Field 
  function that a Payroll Deduction Agreement is ended (because the liability is 
  satisfied or for any other reason) Pattern Letter 2571C, Discontinue/Adjust 
  Payroll Deduction, can be sent to the employer, selecting the appropriate 
  paragraphs. (See Exhibit 5.14.10–1.) This letter may not be used to propose 
  termination of agreements. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Use agreement locator number 1109, per Exhibit 5.14.1–2 on Payroll 
  Deduction Agreements. Campus provides letters to employers for systemically 
  monitored payroll deduction agreements based upon input of agreement locator 
  number 1109. </P></LI></OL></DIV></DIV>

  <P>After securing taxpayer signatures on Form 2159, prepare Letter 2318C to 
  mail or have the taxpayer deliver with Form 2159 to the employer. (See Exhibit 
  5.14.10–2.) </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Input the correct address on Letter 2318C, and direct the employer to mail

    <P></P></LI></OL></DIV>
  <P>These may be mailed directly to employers if taxpayers received Letter 3164 
  A or it was sent at least ten days prior to mailing the Form 2159. (See IRM 
  5.14.10.2(5).) (Also, see IRM 5.14.10.3(8) for cases involving members of the 
  Armed Forces overseas.) Since final payment dates and amounts cannot be 
  definitely determined, write the total amount due (on bal dues included in 
  agreements) on installment agreements forms (including accruals to the date 
  agreements are prepared.) </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Request taxpayers immediately notify their employers of payroll deduction 
  requests and the purpose of the two envelopes. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>After taxpayers and their employers have executed the Forms 2159 and 
  returned them to appropriate contact employees, cases should be submitted for 
  approval. (See IRM 5.14.9.2.) </P>
  <LI>
  <P>After Form 2159 is approved, return the Employer's Copy to the taxpayer to 
  give or mail to their employer, unless the taxpayer received Letter 3164 A or 
  at least ten days have passed since it was mailed to the taxpayer, in which 
  case the Employer's copy of Form 2159 may be mailed directly to the employer. 
  (See IRM 5.14.10.2(5).) </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Also, furnish taxpayers with the Taxpayer’s Copy of the assembly. A second 
  Letter 2318C may accompany the taxpayer's copy, selecting the options 
  regarding acceptance of the agreement (See Exhibit 5.14.10–2.). Note the 
  balance due history that a payroll deduction agreement has been executed. 
  Attach the approved Acknowledgment Copy to the balance due file and process 
  the case appropriately. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>If a payroll deduction agreement is made with a member of the Armed Forces 
  overseas, forward the complete assembly to the taxpayer to give to his or her 
  Commanding Officer (or mail it directly to the Commanding Officer if Letter 
  3164 A was mailed at least 10 days earlier.) (See IRM 5.14.10.2(5).) In these 
  cases, the Taxpayer’s Copy of the assembly will be furnished to the taxpayer 
  by the military establishment. Note the balance due history that a payroll 
  deduction agreement has been executed. Upon receipt of the approved 
  Acknowledgment Copy, attach to the balance due file and process the case 
  appropriately. </P></LI></OL></DIV></DIV>

  <LI>
  <P>Direct debit installment agreements should be strongly encouraged when a 
  payroll deduction agreement is not practical or appropriate, and especially 
  encouraged if taxpayers defaulted on previous installment agreement(s). </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The Direct Debit Installment Agreement (DDIA) system is a means by which 
  funds are automatically debited from a taxpayer’s checking account for the 
  agreed upon installment amount. Some benefits of using direct debit 
  installment agreements are: </P>

  <OL type=A>
    <LI>
    <P>less chance of taxpayers forgetting to make their payment; </P>
    <LI>
    <P>less chance of a missed payment because the money was spent on other 
    expenses; </P>
    <LI>
    <P>since no check is involved, there is no chance of it being lost, 
    mishandled, misapplied, or being returned as incomplete or unsigned; </P>
    <LI>
    <P>IRS personnel will not have to manually post checks; </P>
    <LI>
    <P>"float" time associated with processing paper documents is eliminated; 
    and </P>
    <LI>
    <P>the installment agreement default rate is reduced. </P></LI></OL></DIV>
  <P></P>
  <LI>
  <P>Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) is sometimes used in place of DDIA, and for 
  the purposes of this section has the same meaning. The Electronic Federal Tax 
  Payment System (EFTPS) is used to pay by electronic funds transfer. See 
  Publication 966, website <SPAN class=underline><U>www.eftps.gov </U></SPAN>or 
  call 1-800-555-4477 or 1-800-945-8400 for more information. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Transit/ABA Number: This is a nine digit number usually located on the 
  bottom left hand corner of a check. This number identifies the taxpayer’s bank 
  account in the Automatic Clearing House (ACH) system. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Instructions for direct debit installment agreements are on the back of the 
  Taxpayer’s Copy of Form 433–D, Installment Agreement. The taxpayer must sign 
  the Form 433–D and initial the bottom of the form when this type of agreement 
  is secured. A blank, voided check must be attached to the IRS Copy of Form
