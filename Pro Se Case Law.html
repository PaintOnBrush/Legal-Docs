  <p> 
    <strong>Non-Lawyer pro se litigants not to be held to same standards as a practicing lawyer</strong><BR> 
    <BR> 
    Many pro se litigants will use this in their pleadings; "Pleadings in this<BR> 
    case are being filed by Plaintiff In Propria Persona, wherein pleadings are<BR> 
    to be considered without regard to technicalities. Propria, pleadings are<BR> 
    not to be held to the same high standards of perfection as practicing<BR> 
    lawyers. See Haines v. Kerner 92 Sct 594, also See Power 914 F2d 1459 (11th<BR> 
    Cir1990), also See Hulsey v. Ownes 63 F3d 354 (5th Cir 1995). also See In<BR> 
    Re: HALL v. BELLMON 935 F.2d 1106 (10th Cir. 1991)." <BR> 
    <BR> 
    In Puckett v. Cox, it was held that a pro-se pleading requires less<BR> 
    stringent reading than one drafted by a lawyer (456 F2d 233 (1972 Sixth<BR> 
    Circuit USCA). Justice Black in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 at 48 (1957)<BR> 
&quot;The Federal Rules rejects the approach that pleading is a game of skill in<BR> 
    which one misstep by counsel may be decisive to the outcome and accept the<BR> 
    principle that the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on<BR> 
    the merits.&quot; According to Rule 8(f) FRCP and the State Court rule which<BR> 
    holds that all pleadings shall be construed to do substantial justice." <br> 
  </p> 
  <p><a name="dismissal"></a><strong>Defense against dismissal of complaint under Rule 12-B</strong><BR> 
    <BR> 
    There is legal sufficiency to show Plaintiff is entitled to relief under his<BR> 
    Complaint. <em>A Complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim</em><BR> 
    unless it appears beyond a doubt that the Plaintiff can prove no set of<BR> 
    facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. See Conley<BR> 
    v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957) also Neitzke v. Williams, 109 S. Ct.<BR> 
    1827, 1832 (1989). Rule 12(b)(6) does not countenance dismissals based on a<BR> 
    judge's disbelief of a complaint's factual allegations. In applying the<BR> 
    Conley standard, the Court will &quot;accept the truth of the well-pleaded<BR> 
    factual allegations of the Complaint.&quot; <BR>

    <p> 
    The Fifth Amendment, provides in pertinent part that "nor be deprived of<BR> 
    life, liberty, or property, without due process of law..." Due process is<BR> 
    denied when a meaningful hearing is denied as in this cause. <BR> 
    <BR> 
    The Seventh Amendment, provides in pertinent part that "In suits at common<BR> 
    law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right<BR> 
    to trial by jury shall be preserved..." This language does not include a<BR> 
    single reference to "manipulation" of a jury by the Court in a conspiracy<BR> 
    with lawyers to design a verdict suitable to the Court through the use of<BR> 
    lawyer rules, judicial rules, court rules, or otherwise trumped-up legal<BR> 
    technicalities and instructions which effectively "handcuffs" the jury. All<BR> 
    of these activities are no more or less than a denial of the right to a jury<BR> 
    of peers with the constitutional authority to judge both the facts and law<BR> 
    in a case. <BR> 
    <BR> 
    The Thirteenth Amendment, provides in pertinent part that "Neither slavery<BR> 
    nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime....., shall<BR> 
    exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction".<BR> 
    These judges through their private conduct in conspiracy with the lawyer<BR> 
    defendants, caused the Court to effectuate this Plaintiff to "Compulsory<BR> 
    Involuntary Servitude", an act punishable under Title 18 1584 as a criminal act. <BR> 
    <BR> 
    The Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause and Equal Protection clause<BR> 
    (Section 1), expressly declares no state shall make or enforce any law which<BR> 
    shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;<BR> 
    nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,<BR> 
    without due process of law..." <BR> 
    <BR> 
    The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 3, provides in pertinent part that "No<BR> 
    person shall hold any office, civil or military, under the United States or<BR> 
    under any State.....who, having previously taken an oath,....as an executive<BR> 
    or judicial officer of any State to support the Constitution of the United<BR>

  <h5><a  name="civilrights"></a><strong>Civil Rights Issues:</strong><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; A Continuance of Constitutional Issues</h5> 
    <BR> 
    Title 42 USC 1983 provides in relevant part that: "every person who, under<BR> 
    color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any<BR> 
    State....subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United<BR> 
    States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of<BR> 
    any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution. ..shall<BR> 
    be liable to the party injured...." <BR> 
    <BR> 
    A Title 42 1985 action which seeks compensatory and punitive damages in<BR> 
    conjunction with equitable relief as in this case is considered a legal<BR> 
    claim, entititling Plaintiff to a jury trial. See An-Ti v. Michigan<BR> 
    Technological Univ., 493 F. Supp. 1137.<BR> 
    <BR> 
    Plaintiff alleges a "class based", invidiously discriminatory animus is<BR> 
    behind the conspirators' action as the Court records reflect. That the<BR> 
    actions were clearly a product of bias and prejudice of the Court. See<BR> 
    Griffen v. Breckridge, 403 U.S. 88, 102 (1971)<BR> 
    <BR> 
    The U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health<BR> 
    Clinic 113 S.Ct.753 (1993) that the standard announced in Griffen was not<BR> 
    restricted to "race" discrimination. It is therefore reasonable to assume<BR> 
    that 1985 (3) may be used for "class-based" claims other than race which is<BR> 
    alleged in this case. <BR> 
    <BR> 
    The defendant lawyers acting in conspiracy with state actors under color of<BR> 
    law have become state actors in this case. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled<BR> 
    that "private parties", lawyers in this case, may be held to the same<BR> 
    standard of "state actors" where the final and decisive act was carried out<BR> 
    in conspiracy with a state actor or state official. See Dennis v. Sparks,<BR> 
    449 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct., 183 also See Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S.<BR> 
    144, 90 S.Ct. 1598. <BR> 
    <BR> 
    Plaintiff's Complaint is based in part on discrimination and political<BR> 
    affiliations by lawyers and lawyer-judges, under 42 USCA 1983 &amp; 1985. See<BR> 
    reversal case Acevedo-Diaz v Aponte (1993, CA1 Puerto Rico) 1 F3d 62,<BR> 
    summary op at (CA1 Puerto Rico) 21  M.L.W. 3212, 14 R.I.L.W. 389.<BR> 
    <BR> 
    Section 1985(3) under Title 42 reaches both conspiracies under color of law<BR> 
    and conspiracies effectuated through purely private conduct. In this case<BR> 
    Plaintiff has alleged a class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus is<BR> 
    behind the conspirators' action as the court records reflect. That<BR> 
    actionable cause is the treatment of a non-lawyer pro se litigant as a<BR> 
    distinct "class-based subject" of the Court, wherein denial of equal<BR> 
    protection of the laws and denial of due process was clearly the product of<BR> 
    bias and prejudice of the Court. See Griffen v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88,<BR> 
    102 (1971). <BR> 
    <BR> 
    The U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health<BR> 
    Clinic 113 S.Ct. 753 (1993) that the standard announced in Griffen was not<BR> 
    restricted to "race" discrimination. It is therefore reasonable to assume<BR> 
    that 1985(3) may be used for "class-based" claims other than race as alleged<BR> 
    in this case. It is also important to note in Bray the U.S. Supreme Court's<BR> 
    interpretation of the requirement under 1985(3) that a private conspiracy be<BR> 
    one "for the purpose of depriving... any person or "class" of persons of the<BR> 
    equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under<BR> 
    the laws, which the Court said mandates "an intent to deprive persons of a<BR> 
    right guaranteed against private impairment. <BR> 
    <BR> 
    The U.S. Supreme Court in Griffen emphasized 1985(3) <BR> 
    legislative history was directed to the prevention of deprivations which<BR> 
    shall attack the equality of rights of American citizens; that any violation<BR> 
    of the right, the animus and effect of which is to strike down the citizen,<BR> 
    to the end that he may not enjoy equality of rights as contrasted with his<BR> 
    and other citizens' rights, shall be within the scope of remedies... Id. at 100.<BR> 
    <BR> 
    Supreme Court has ruled that "private parties" may be held to the same<BR> 
    standard of "state actors" in cases such as the instant cause where the<BR> 
    final and decisive act was carried out in conspiracy with a state official.<BR> 
    See Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24, 101 S. Ct., 183 and Adickes v. S.H. Kress<BR> 
&amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144, 90 S. Ct. 1598.<BR> 
  </p> 
  <p><strong>Jurisdictional Issues:</strong><BR> 
    It is proper for this District Court to take Jurisdiction of any civil<BR> 
    action authorized by law to be commenced by any person. See Title 28 Section<BR> 
    1343 (1)(2)(3)(4) . <BR> 
    <BR> 
    Jurisdiction is proper under Title 28 Sections 1332, 1335, 1357, 1441 and 1603. <BR> 
    <BR> 
    The First issue is "Convenience" and second issue is the "interest-of-<BR> 
    justice" standard under 28 USCA 1406. <BR> 
    <BR> 
    <b>Dismissal Issues:</b><BR> 
    <BR> 
    The Complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears to a certainty that<BR> 
    Plaintiffs would be entitled to no relief under any state of facts that<BR> 
    could be proved in support of the claims. See Gomez v Toledo (1980, US) 64 L<BR> 
    Ed 2d 572, 100 S Ct 1920.<BR> 
    <BR> 
    The allegations of a Complaint prepared by a state prisoner acting pro se<BR> 
    are generally taken as true for purposes of motion to dismiss. See Hughes v<BR> 
    Rowe (1980, US) 66 L Ed 2d 163, 101 S Ct 173. <BR> 
    <BR> 
    <strong>RULE 60</strong> <BR> 
    <BR> 
    The final judgement of this Court should be vacated under Rule 60(B). The<BR> 
    Court is requested to weigh the interest in substantial justice against the<BR> 
    simple need for preserving finality of the judgement. See Expenditures<BR> 
    Unlimited Aquatic Enterprises, Inc. v. Smithsonian Institute, 1974, 500 F.2d.<BR> 
    808, 163 U.S. App.D.C.140. See also Brown v. Clark Equipment Co., D.C. Mc.<BR>

    Judgement, the following cases are offered; Picking v. Pennsylvania Railway,<BR> 
    (151 F2d.240) Third Circuit Court of Appeals. <BR> 
    <BR>

    in a suit for protection of civil rights, the court should endeavor to<BR> 
    construe the Plaintiff's pleading without regard to technicalities.&quot;</em> In<BR> 
    Walter Process Equipment v. Food Machinery 382 U.S. 172 (1965) it was held<BR> 
    that in a "motion to dismiss", the material allegations of the complaint are<BR> 
    taken as admitted."<BR>

    January 2, 2004 Void Judgments Understanding Void Judgments<BR> 
    <BR> 
    Definition of Void Judgment: any judgment which a court renders while lacking jurisdiction, either of the subject matter or the parties. <BR> 
  <blockquote> * Wahl v. Round Valley Bank 38 Ariz , 411, 300 P. 955(1931), <BR> 
    * Tube City Mining &amp; Millng Co. v. Otterson, 16 Ariz. 305, 146p 203(1914); and <BR> 
    * Millken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 61 S. CT. 339,85 L. Ed. 2d 278 (1940). <BR> 
  </blockquote> 
  Subject matter jurisdiction can never be presumed, waived, or constructed,<BR> 
  even by mutual consent of the parties, and it has two parts:<BR> 
  <BR> 
  <blockquote>(1) the statutory or common law authority for the court to hear the case, and <BR> 
    <BR> 
    (2) the appearance and testimony of a competent fact witness - in other<BR> 
    words, sufficiency of pleadings. </blockquote> 
  <BR> 
  When we examine a judgment, the following indices tell us whether a court<BR> 
  had subject matter jurisdiction. Successful litigants will know each and<BR> 
  every one of them by heart. Subject matter jurisdiction usually fails<BR> 
  because of one of these reasons: <BR> 
  <BR> 
  <blockquote>(1) No petition in the record of the case, Brown v. VanKeuren,<BR> 
    340 Ill. 118,122 (1930). <BR> 
    <BR> 
    (2) Defective petition filed, Same case as above. <BR> 
    <BR> 
    (3) Fraud committed in the procurement of jurisdiction, Fredman<BR>

    1975) <BR> 
    <BR> 
    (21) A judge does not validly hold office because of the absence of<BR> 
    or a defect in one or more of the following: <BR> 

    <blockquote> a. qualification as a candidate (typically include American<BR> 
      citizenship, bar membership, registered voter status, a number of years of<BR> 
      service as an attorney, filing of a financial statement that shows<BR> 
      compliance with law, not serving in any other branch of government), <BR> 
      <BR> 
      b. appointment or election to office (illegal campaign contributions or<BR> 
      other illegal financial entanglements can disqualify),<BR> 
      <BR> 
      c. acceptance of appointment or elected position (some never bother to<BR> 
      accept the appointment or elected position), <BR> 
      <BR> 
      d. one or more loyalty oaths associated with qualification and service<BR> 
      (a typical judge must swear the following loyalty oaths, evidenced by the<BR> 
      signature of a person duly authorized to take acknowledgements):<BR> 

      <blockquote> i. Elector's (voter registration) loyalty oath<BR> 
        <BR> 
        ii. Bar   member's oath<BR> 
        <BR> 
        iii. Pre-appointment/election candidate's loyalty oath<BR> 
        <BR> 
        iv. Candidate's oath<BR> 
        <BR> 
        v. Public Officer's or Judge's loyalty oath<BR> 
        <BR> 
        vi. Public employee's loyalty oath.</blockquote> 
    </blockquote> 
  </blockquote> 
  </p> 
  <p> <strong>About Loyalty Oaths and Appointments</strong><BR> 
  <blockquote>Many public employees have serious defects in their oath and appointment<BR> 
    documents, and many do not have those documents on record as required by<BR> 
    law. The wise litigant will obtain certified copies of all such documents<BR> 
    for all officers of the court (judges, clerk, prosecutors or opposing<BR> 
    counsel, and bailiffs), and move for the disqualification of any and all for<BR> 
    whom valid oath and appointment documents do not exist.<BR> 
    <BR> 
    The judge validly holds office if and only if a copy of the judge's oath of<BR> 
    office exists, and you can rightly demand that the proper final oath sworn<BR> 
    or affirmed upon taking office situates in the judge's chambers. You can go<BR> 
    to his office and demand to see a copy of his oath of office at any time. <BR> 
    <BR> 
    The federal laws covering judges and other public officials are to be found<BR> 
    at 5 U.S.C. 3331, 28 U.S.C. 543, and 5 U.S.C. 1983. States typically have<BR> 
    similar laws. A judge trespasses upon the court unless he complies with all<BR> 
    of the provisions of relevant law. Once a proven trespasser upon the court<BR> 
    (upon the law) not one of his judgments, pronouncements or orders have<BR> 
    validity. All constitute nullities and have void status. <BR> 
    <BR> 
    Upon discovering such a trespass, you will face serious difficulty getting<BR> 
    the trespasser removed from office, and the fact that so many litigants give<BR> 
    up in the process explains why so many criminal trespassers still function<BR> 
    in public office.</blockquote>

      ============================================================================</h5> 
    <p> Powe v. United States, 5 Cir., 1940, 109 F.2d 147, certiorari denied, 309 U.S. 679, 60 S.Ct. 717 <BR> 
      <BR> 
      I finally found it. It's quoted a bit different than the opinion quoted:<BR> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p> In Powe v. U.S. 109 F2d 147, 149 (1940) the court determined the term<BR> 
        `citizen,' when used in federal laws, excludes State citizens.<BR> 
        <BR> 
        The court was specifically speaking about 18 U.S.C.A &sect;51 in its<BR> 
        deleiniation of citizens, however, that does not mean it does not apply to<BR> 
        other stautory areas.<BR>

        Southern District of Alabama; John McDuffie, Judge. Sam B. Powe and<BR> 
        others were convicted for conspiring to injure, oppress, threaten and<BR> 
        intimidate a named citizen of the United States in the free exercise of his<BR> 
        right and privilege as such <BR> 
        citizen to speak and publish his views in certain newspapers, and they<BR>

        Coley, Jr., and George A. Sossaman, all of Mobile, Ala., for appellants.<BR> 
        Francis H. Inge, U.S. Atty., of Mobile, Ala., for appellee. Before<BR> 
        SIBLEY, HUTCHESON, and McCORD, Circuit Judges. SIBLEY, Circuit Judge.<BR> 
        The five appellants were indicted (with another who was acquitted) for<BR> 
        conspiring to injure, oppress, threaten and intimidate a named citizen of<BR> 
        the United States in the free exercise of his right and privilege as such<BR> 
        citizen to speak and publish his views in certain newspapers. Their several<BR> 
        demurrers were overruled and appellants Page 149 were convicted and<BR> 
        sentenced. Of the numerous rulings<BR> 
        asserted to be error on this appeal we need consider only the judgment<BR> 
        upon the demurrers. The grounds of demurrer to each count include<BR> 
        these: That no crime against the United States is charged; that the right<BR> 
        of free speech and free press is not secured by the Constitution and laws<BR> 
        of the United States against infraction by individuals, but only by federal<BR> 
        or State action; and that the counts are too vague. The eight counts are<BR> 
        varying statements of the same conspiracy. Some of them say the conspiracy<BR> 
        was to prevent future publications; others to oppress and injure because of<BR> 
        past publications. Some counts state the nature of the publications, and<BR> 
        the means to be used to oppress the writer; others fail so to state, baldly<BR> 
        alleging in the words of the statute a conspiracy to injure and oppress the<BR> 
        citizen of the United States in the exercise of or for having exercised his<BR> 
        privilege of free speech and free press. One of the fullest statements is the<BR> 
        second count, which charges that the conspiracy was to injure and oppress<BR> 
        the executive editor of the Mobile Register and the Mobile Press,<BR> 
        newspapers published in Mobile, Alabama, he being a citizen of the United<BR> 
        States, in his exercise of his right and privilege secured to him by the<BR> 
        Constitution and laws of the United States, to write and print in said<BR> 
        newspapers his editorials exposing and condemning various forms of illegal<BR> 
        gambling and illegal lotteries in Mobile County, Alabama, and calling upon<BR> 
        the officials of the City of Mobile and County of Mobile, charged with the<BR> 
        suppression thereof, to take action to suppress the same and to punish the<BR> 
        offenders; the plan being to procure a photograph of the editor in a lewd<BR> 
        or obscene act and to use the same in threatening to show the photograph,<BR> 
        and in threatening<BR> 
        to use it as evidence in prosecuting the editor, and thus to stop his<BR> 
        publications; numerous overt acts to carry out the plan being alleged. Do<BR> 
        these facts make an offense against the United States? The statute<BR> 
        relied on in support of the indictment originated as Section 6 of the Act<BR> 
        of May 31, 1870, 16 Stat. 141 , entitled "An Act of enforce the Right of<BR> 
        Citizens of the United States to vote in the several States of this Union,<BR> 
        and for other Purposes." It appeared in the Revised Statutes with some<BR> 
        alteration as Section 5508; was carried without change into the Criminal<BR> 
        Code as Section 19; and now appears as Section 51 of Title 18 of the United<BR> 
        States Code, 18 U.S.C.A. § 51. The applicable language is: "If two or more<BR> 
        persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in<BR> 
        the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by<BR> 
        the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised<BR> 
        the same * * * they shall be fined not more than $5,000 and imprisoned not<BR> 
        more than ten years, and shall, moreover, be thereafter ineligible to any<BR> 
        office, or place of honor, profit, or trust created by the Constitution or<BR> 
        laws of the United States." Some of the Sections of the Enforcement Act of<BR> 
        1870 were repealed in 1909, but Section 6, as then reenacted, stands good<BR> 
        for whatever it properly covers. United States v. Moseley, 238 U.S. 383, 35<BR> 
        S.Ct. 904, 59 L.Ed. 1355. In its construction it is proper to apply the<BR> 
        rule that criminal laws are to be construed strictly, and to bear in mind<BR> 
        that other rule that a construction is to be avoided, if possible, that<BR> 
        would render the law unconstitutional, or raise grave doubts thereabout. In<BR> 
        view of these rules it is held that "citizen" means "citizen of the United<BR> 
        States", and not person generally, nor citizen of a<BR> 
        State; and that the "rights and privileges secured by the Constitution or<BR> 
        laws of the United States" means those specially and validly secured<BR> 
        thereby. Thus limited, this section has been enforced as constitutional. Ex<BR> 
        parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 4 S.Ct. 152, 28 L.Ed. 274; United States v.<BR> 
        Waddell, 112 U.S. 76, 5 S.Ct. 35, 28 L.Ed. 673; Logan v. United States, 144<BR> 
        U.S. 263, 12 S.Ct. 617, 36 L.Ed. 429; United States v. Moseley, supra. In<BR> 
        the Yarbrough case the right involved was that to vote in a Congressional<BR> 
        election, as it was in the Moseley case; in the Waddell case it was the<BR> 
        right to make a federal homestead entry; and in the Logan case it was the<BR> 
        right to be secure from<BR> 
        lawless violence while a prisoner in the hands of a United States Marshal.<BR> 
        These matters, all within the federal power, Congress could protect under<BR> 
        the general authority to pass "all necessary and proper laws", under<BR> 
        U.S.C.A. Constitution, Art. 1, Sect. 8, Par. 18. But Section 5519 of the<BR> 
        Revised Statutes, which undertook similarly to punish conspiracies against<BR> 
        any person to deprive him of the equal protection of the laws, or Page 150<BR> 
        to prevent State authorities from affording such protection, was held<BR> 
        unconstitutional, because neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor any other<BR> 
        part of the Constitution put the matter of conspiracies by individuals<BR> 
        touching such matters within the power of Congress, but only gave power to<BR> 
        correct wrong action by the State or its officers. It was so held in United<BR> 
        States v. Harris, 106 U.S. 629, 1 S.Ct. 601, 27 L.Ed. 290, where the person<BR> 
        mobbed was in the custody of a State Sheriff; and in Baldwin v. Franks, 120<BR> 
        U.S. 678, 7 S.Ct. 656, 763, 30 L.Ed. 766, where the rights of a Chinese<BR> 
        under a treaty of the United States were involved. It was again held that<BR> 
        the power of Congress was not extended to protect against violations by<BR> 
        individuals of the general rights of persons and citizens by the mention of<BR> 
        such rights in the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A., in the Civil Rights<BR> 
        Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835. The reasoning of these cases,<BR> 
        though opposed by some dissents, is full and convincing, and the conclusion<BR> 
        reached as to the effect upon federal power of the Fourteenth Amendment has<BR> 
        stood for more than two generations. Pursuing further the application<BR> 
        of the statute now<BR> 
        before us, in Baldwin v. Franks, supra, it was held the word "citizen"<BR> 
        means citizen of the United States in a political sense, and did not<BR> 
        include a resident Chinese. Again in Hodges v. United States, 203 U.S. 1,<BR> 
        27 S.Ct. 6, 51 L.Ed. 65, the section was invoked against conspirators who<BR> 
        were charged with interfering with citizens in their right or liberty of<BR> 
        contracting to work in a lawful occupation, but the court held that this<BR> 
        was a common right of all persons, and the Fourteenth Amendment did not put<BR> 
        it under federal protection except against State action; and the fact that<BR> 
        the persons there involved were negroes did not bring the matter within the<BR> 
        special ambit of the Thirteenth Amendment. Similarly in United States v.<BR> 
        Wheeler, 254 U.S. 281, 41 S.Ct. 133, 65 L.Ed. 270,<BR> 
        the right invaded by the conspirators was the citizen's right to remain in<BR> 
        the State of his choice, and to remove only at his own will. The Court<BR> 
        conceded the right to be fundamental and to belong to the citizens of each<BR> 
        State, and to be guarded in part against State interference by Art. 4,<BR> 
        Sect. 2 of the Constitution, but held that no federal offense was involved<BR> 
        in an abduction done by individual conspirators. The only case cited to us<BR> 
        in which a conspiracy against the right of freedom of speech was involved<BR> 
        is United States v. Hall, in the Circuit Court of Alabama, 26 Fed.Cas. 79,<BR> 
        No. 15,282. Justice Woods there upheld the indictment, but this was in<BR> 
        1871, before the decision of any of the above cited cases in the Supreme<BR> 
        Court, and it is not reconcilable with his own opinion in United States v.<BR> 
        Harris, 106 U.S. 629, 1 S.Ct. 601, 27 L.Ed. 290. We are<BR> 
        controlled by the above cited decisions of the Supreme Court. That the<BR> 
        right of free speech and a free press, understood with the limitations to<BR> 
        prevent abuses which the law has always annexed to these freedoms, is<BR> 
        fundamental to the continuance of free political institutions, and is the<BR> 
        right both of citizens and other persons in the United States and the<BR> 
        several States needs no reassertion. The ground has been covered recently<BR> 
        and the right vindicated as against State action by federal power by<BR> 
        virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, in such cases as Grosjean v. American<BR> 
        Press Co., 297 U.S. 233, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660; De Jonge v. Oregon,<BR> 
        299 U.S. 353, 57 S.Ct. 255, 81 L. Ed. 278; Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U.S. 242,<BR> 
        57 S.Ct. 732, 81<BR> 
        L.Ed. 1066; Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 444, 58 S.Ct. 666, 82 L.Ed. 949;<BR> 
        Schneider v. State of New Jersey (Town of Irvington), 60 S.Ct. 146, 84<BR> 
        L.Ed. ___; Frank Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U.S.<BR> 
        496, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423. But this effect of the Fourteenth<BR> 
        Amendment on State action, as has been shown, is not enough to bring<BR> 
        conspiracies of individuals within the punitive power of Congress under the<BR> 
        section we are discussing. Nor can the special mention of freedom of speech<BR> 
        and press in the First Amendment have that effect. The provision there is<BR> 
&quot;Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of speech, or of<BR> 
        the press." That the first ten amendments were intended as limitations on the<BR> 
        power of the federal government and are not grants of power to it has been<BR> 
        established from the beginning. A flat prohibition against the regulation<BR> 
        of a matter in one direction cannot result in endowing Congress with power<BR> 
        to regulate it in another direction. This amendment, while regarding<BR> 
        freedom in religion, in speaking and printing, and in assembling and<BR> 
        petitioning the government for redress of Page 151 grievances as<BR> 
        fundamental and precious to all, seeks only to forbid that Congress should<BR> 
        meddle therein. If Congress can make any law in behalf of these it is<BR> 
        because of some power elsewhere expressly granted, or because it is a law<BR> 
        necessary and proper to carry out such power. We are familiar with federal<BR> 
        laws touching on freedom of speech and press such as the Espionage Law of<BR> 
        1917, 40 Stats. 217 , which rested on the war power of Congress and the<BR> 
        general implied power to maintain the safety of<BR> 
        the Government. See Frohwerk v. United States, 249 U.S. 204, 39 S.Ct. 249,<BR> 
        63 L.Ed. 561; Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed.<BR> 
        470. And we do not doubt that Congress may directly protect its citizens in<BR> 
        their right to assemble peaceably and petition the federal government for<BR> 
        redress, just as it may protect persons from unlawful violence while in<BR> 
        federal custody, under what are called the implied powers of Congress.<BR> 
        Federal elections might probably be directly protected by Congress<BR> 
        although no question of race, color, or previous condition of servitude<BR> 
        under the Fifteenth Amendment be present. But in the cases supposed<BR> 
        Congress would interfere directly only because of the necessity to maintain<BR> 
        a federal right in its integrity. Because the federal<BR> 
        government is a republican one in which the will of the people ought to<BR> 
        prevail, and because that will ought to be expressive of an informed public<BR> 
        opinion, the freedom of speaking and printing on subjects relating to that<BR> 
        government, its elections, its laws, its operations and its officers is<BR> 
        vital to it. Assuming that for this reason Congress, if it finds it<BR> 
        necessary, can legislate to maintain such freedom in that field, it does<BR> 
        not follow that Congress can legislate generally to preserve such freedom<BR> 
        in discussing religious affairs, or social or artistic matters, or matters<BR> 
        of purely State concern. Again, by Art. 4, Sect. 4, of the Constitution the<BR> 
        United States shall guarantee to every State a republican form of<BR> 
        government. Should a tyranny be set up in a State accompanied by a<BR> 
        suppression of free speech and press, conceivably the Congress might be<BR> 
        called on, temporarily in the execution of this guaranty, to pass a law<BR> 
        securing against individual<BR> 
        violence free speech in such State; but the section before us is not such<BR> 
        a law. The dividing line between the powers of the State and federal<BR> 
        governments in preserving these great general rights of persons, and the<BR> 
        difference between the rights and privileges of a citizen of the State and<BR> 
        of the United States, was clearly recognized in United States v.<BR> 
        Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 552, 23 L.Ed. 588, when the section under<BR> 
        discussion first came before the Supreme Court. It was there stated that<BR> 
        the right of assembly to petition Congress would be "an attribute of<BR> 
        national citizenship, and, as such, under the protection of, and guaranteed<BR> 
        by, the United States", and "if it had been alleged * * * that the object<BR> 
        of the defendants was to prevent a meeting for such a purpose, the case<BR> 
        would have been within the statute, and within the scope of the sovereignty of the<BR> 
        United States." But since the indictment only alleged generally that the<BR> 
        meeting was "for a lawful purpose", no crime was charged, because the<BR> 
        protection of the right of assembly in general was in the power of the<BR> 
        State. The other counts alleged conspiracies generally to deprive of the<BR> 
        equal protection of the law, and of life and liberty without due process<BR> 
        of law, and the Fourteenth Amendment was held not to extend federal power<BR> 
        as to those matters beyond the controlling of State action. On the<BR> 
        authority of the Cruikshank case the counts in the present indictment,<BR> 
        which do not disclose what the speaking and printing conspired against<BR> 
        related to, charge no offense, because the right to freely speak and print<BR> 
        about matters in general is not "secured by the Constitution and laws of<BR> 
        the United States." The other counts which state the speaking and printing<BR> 
        related wholly to matters with which the City and County of Mobile were<BR> 
        concerned, and with which the<BR> 
        United States had no concern, expressly disclose the matter to have been<BR> 
        beyond the authority of Congress, and not a right or privilege protected<BR> 
        by the section. The demurrers to the indictment ought therefore to have<BR> 
        been sustained. The judgment is reversed, the conviction set aside, and the<BR> 
        cause remanded with direction to sustain the demurrers. Page 152 Page 178</p>
