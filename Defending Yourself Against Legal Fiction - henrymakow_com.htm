understand this <A 
href="http://www.henrymakow.com/laws_exist_in_fiction.html">"legal fiction" 
argument,</A> and welcome clarifications by knowledgeable readers.) 
</I><BR><BR><B>by Rino </B></FONT><BR><BR>
<DIV><FONT face="Arial" size="2"><FONT style="font-size: 1.25em;"><B>The 'false 
allegation' industry</B></FONT> also exists here  in Australia. We need to draw 
back the curtain and begin to pay attention to the  man behind the curtain. 
<FONT style="font-size: 1.25em;"><BR><BR>There are critical points to 
understand. Once the world  went off the Gold standard, the people now 
in&nbsp;effect&nbsp;became dead  to the Law.. All courts are courts belonging 
the central banks, being the  creditor in any case. A Judge cannot see the 
substantive Law in relation to a  man or woman's God-given rights anymore under 
public policy. Public policy refers  to the bankruptcy/insolvency of that 
nation.</FONT></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT style="font-size: 1.25em;"></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size="2" style="font-size: 1.25em;">All charges are against the 
created Birth  Certificate Trust estate/prepaid account recognized by the all 
capital letter  name. <BR><BR>The person who is charged is NOT the man but his 
corporate entity account.  All the courts want is to settle a public account and 
they want access to your  Birth Certificate trust/prepaid estate account. 
<BR><BR>When you argue/defend and a  claim, which in commerce is a demand for 
money, you are in effect saying 'I  don't want to pay' and at this point of 
dishonour there may be more bogus  charges/claims come forward due to this. So 
all legislative acts apply only to  these corporate persons, individuals, 
taxpayers, residents, etc.; and guess what,  they are all created fictions of 
law. They are not real they are created  fictions of law.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT style="font-size: 1.25em;"></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size="2" style="font-size: 1.25em;">The idea is not to argue/defend 
because the living  man or woman is not even named as a party in any court 
action, only the birth  certificate/Corporate Trust entity is named. 
<BR><BR>That is why it is said that  'arguments are for fools'. This information 
applies in Canada, Australia,  America and anywhere else where a central bank 
exists. <BR><BR>So what happens when  there is a 'Charge' against someone? An 
account is created and it must be  settled otherwise someone is placed in prison 
as collateral for that debt.  Arguing and defending creates 
problems.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT style="font-size: 1.25em;"></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size="2" style="font-size: 1.25em;">This is what they do when they 
create a charge. The  courts/agencies use the important concept/principle of 
'Bankers Acceptance law'.  It is the important concept and principle of primary 
liability.&nbsp; The newly  created charge is created by the 'maker' of the 
instrument, i.e, lawyer, agency,  court or any other third party entity and the 
bankers acceptance law goes like  this, 'The primary liability to 'pay' an 
instrument rests with the maker ( i.e  lawyer, agency, prosecutor, court etc) of 
that instrument UNLESS someone else  (The charged entity) refuses (argues or 
defends) to pay. <BR><BR>Under the rules of Admiralty Law, he who brings forward 
a charge must also bring forward the remedy  and that remedy is your birth 
Certificate/Trust prepaid asset account. The  reason they 'falsely charge' 
people is because they are well aware of the  existence of this Trust account 
and you are deemed to be in control of your  estate, operating as a Trustee of 
that account.<BR><BR>However they will never openly  admit to this under public 
policy and&nbsp;they will always remain silent and  refer you to some 
legislative act and make you think it applies to you.  </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT style="font-size: 1.25em;"></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size="2" style="font-size: 1.25em;">When they say to you that 
'anything you say can and  will be used against you', what they are really 
saying is be careful how you  respond to our presentment/claims because you may 
not know what it is that we  are really asking of you! <BR><BR>They know and 
understand that all energy comes from  the living man who in reality is the 
creditor, however if you create dishonour  they will treat you as the debtor and 
the debtor has no rights. <BR><BR>What is the  false allegation industry really 
all about? It is proof that you have in fact an  prepaid Trust/estate account 
created at your birth and evidenced by your birth  Certificate. Your birth 
certificate is evidence of two things: 1) that a Trust  does in fact exist and 
2) it is a security, which is used as collateral by any  government to receive 
funding from the central banks. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT style="font-size: 1.25em;"></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size="2" style="font-size: 1.25em;">If you understand that the Bible 
tells us not to  charge your 'brother' because you make a debtor of him and this 
is why those in  power know and understand this concept. This is why they 
created the fiction  corporate entity because it is supposed to protect/buffer 
you.<BR><BR>Once Adam and Eve  dishonoured the creator, they were taken out of 
the Garden of Eden which was no  longer a commercial free zone and absolutely 
everything that is done, is done in  commerce involving commercial accounts. 
<BR><BR>Ever since then the same principle has  applied, creditors are winners 
and debtors are losers! Were we not told to be  the 'head' (creditor) and not 
the 'tail' (debtor)? Its all about an account, the  rest is all illusion, just 
ask for the bill so that you can&nbsp;do a bankers  acceptance by your 
endorsement of the charging instrument/complaint and proceed  to&nbsp;settle and 
close the account. However be prepared they will test you  first. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT style="font-size: 1.25em;"></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size="2" style="font-size: 1.25em;">We as living people no longer 
know or understand  who we are and everything has been inverted upside down. We 
have lost our  identities and once again have given away our birthright for 
"bowl of  pottage."</FONT></DIV>

Fiction""</H3>
<DIV class="comment">
<P><STRONG>Jim</STRONG> said (February  9, 2010):<BR></P>
<P>We in the United States of America live in areas governed by Admiralty Law, 
not Common Law that once was the law in our court system.</P>
<P>It's a law of contracts. According to Admiralty Law only entities created by 
the State are subject to this law. Any entity created by the State is called a 
Person. Therefore that entity is a fiction. Examples are a corporation, trust, 
or a limited partnership. </P>
<P>When you and I were born from our mother's womb we were considered human 
beings, not persons. Once our parents were issued a Birth Certificate we now had 
legal status under the Admiralty Law of the Sea. </P>
<P>Common Law is law of the land where human beings have rights under God. Human 
beings are creatures created by God's miracle.  Under the Law of the Sea only 
persons are recognized and they no rights, only privileges granted by Admiralty 
Law.</P>
<P> To differentiate between a human being and a person all government agencies 
use capital letters when referring to a person. Only persons are subject to 
Admiralty Law. Human beings have no standing in their courts. Human beings do 
not need a drivers license, need to pay taxes, need any license a license of any 
kind, nor can they be sued.</P>
<P>Example: Look at the spelling of your name on any document issued from a 
government agency. Your name is in all capital letters. Now look at the spelling 
of your name on any of your diplomas, capital H small enry, capital M small 
akow. Human beings go to church and school. </P>
<P>Only fictions created by a governmental agency goes to court, pays taxes, 
serves in the military, drives a car, hunts ducks, is engaged in business, 
etc.</P>
<P>It was all done years ago for the benefit of the international bankers 
because of the bankruptcy of the corporate UNITED STATES.</P>
<P>Once you learn this, and more you will get an even bigger picture of the 
illusion we Americans and you Canadians are living in.<BR>It truly is a 
Matrix.</P></DIV>

<P>You &amp; your readers might want to check out the introduction of the living 
temple audio at www.creditorsincommerce.com. In the first 30 minutes he explains 
how the international bankers have taken the sovereignty of the American 
people.</P>
<P>Here's a video of a guy in Canada who was exercising his common law right to 
travel &amp; his encounter with the police.<BR>

<P>It has occurred to me that one reason why Obama and his handlers/managers 
have gone to so much effort to prevent anyone from finding his actual birth 
certificate is connected with this stuff, and they may have arranged that there 
is no actual birth certificate for him.  He has been CIA property since before 
birth.  Consider that.<BR></P></DIV>

<DIV class="comment">
<P><STRONG>Jimmy</STRONG> said (February  7, 2010):<BR></P>
<P>Is there any way by which anyone charged with some crime or misdemeanor, can 
settle this "debt" with the courts/bankers without further incurring into any 
other legal charges being posted against your record, as for example being 
actually convicted of these crimes or misdemeanors? In other words, is there a 
pay-your-way-out-of-it method?<BR></P></DIV>

<P><STRONG>P</STRONG> said (February  7, 2010):<BR></P>
<P>Proving what the 'legal fiction' mess is all about and proving that the 
courts are commercial (ie: Admiralty Law) is hard to do as the villains left no 
handbook as to how they constructed this whole false 'legal' realm.  One thing 
that IS easy to prove is the legal fiction that they have hung around your neck 
(of course you and your Mother voluntarily accepted it - that's how everything 
from driver's licenses to income tax works in this country).  Check everything 
you have with an ID on it that is issued by governments, Banks, Credit Unions, 
Insurance companies, tax forms, or corporations and you will find that it is 
issued to or sent to JOHN DOE and not John Doe.  There are only three entities 
that I can think of that have ALL CAPS names: Trusts, corporations, vessels 
(ships).<BR><BR>In legal terms this is known as 'idem sonans' = 'sounds alike' 
and 'stramineus Homo' = a straw man, a substitute put forward as bail or 
security (from Black's Law Dictionary).  When the Judge calls for JOHN DOE and 
you, John Doe answer, you have accepted (without knowing it) the responsibility 
for all of the legal fiction's ('ens legis' being) liabilities.  Once you have 
answered for the 'fiction' - you are screwed !<BR><BR>It is easy enough to get 
out of this Babylonian system but first you have to understand it completely.  
You must first understand who you really are (this requires you to have some 
Biblical knowledge and some knowledge of the founding Father's intent, then you

<P>HI Henry, WIKI:  The Seventh Amendment (Amendment VII) of the United States 
Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, codifies the right to a jury 
trial in certain civil trials. Unlike most of the Bill of Rights, the Supreme 
Court has not incorporated the amendment's requirements to the states under the 
Fourteenth Amendment.</P>
<P></P>
<P>“ In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty 
dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a 
jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than 
according to the rules of the common law.”</P>
<P>PS: For the ordinary person who is called into the court room in any dispute 
over $20, at the first hearing it can be a good idea to "Demand a Jury 
trial."</P>

<P>Henry: This will help explain Rino's "legal fiction" argument.</P>
<P>In addition, you may purchase the book, "They Own It All, Including You"</P>
<P><BR>Edward Mandell House had this to say in a private meeting with Woodrow 
Wilson (President) [1913-1921]</P>
<P>[Very] soon, every American will be required to register their biological 
property in a National system designed to keep track of the people and that will 
operate under the ancient system of pledging.  By such methodology, we can 
compel people to submit to our agenda, which will affect our security as a 
charge back for our fiat paper currency.  Every American will be forced to 
register or suffer not being able to work and earn a living.  They will be our 
chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation 
of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions.  Americans, by 
unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered 
bankrupt and insolvent, forever to remain economic slaves through taxation, 
secured by their pledges.  They will be stripped of their rights and given a 
commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be non the wiser, 
for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and, if by accident one 
or two would figure it out, we have in our arsenal plausible deniability.  After 
all, this is the only logical way to fund government, by floating liens and debt 
to the registrants in the form of benefits and privileges.  This will inevitably 
reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest expectations and leave every American 
a contributor or to this fraud which we will call “Social Insurance.”  </P>
<P>Without realizing it, every American will insure us for any loss we may incur 
and in this manner; every American will unknowingly be our servant, however 
begrudgingly.  The people will become helpless and without any hope for their 
redemption and, we will employ the high office of the President of our dummy 
corporation to foment this plot against America.”</P></DIV>

<P><STRONG>Mark</STRONG> said (February  7, 2010):<BR></P>
<P>As a practicing attorney of over 20 years I can tell you that I have seen a 
number of these extremely convoluted arguments against various aspects of the 
legal systems that descend from English common law in various jurisdictions 
where Britain once ruled. Indeed, some notable scholars have even argued that 
the system itself represents the underground resurgence of wizardry and sorcery 
with its dependence on the use of certain "magic words" to achieve results.</P>
<P>What all the arguments share in common is a divergence between the 
conclusions they draw and the results that will be obtained in court. In short, 
they're not going to get you anywhere. Regardless of the justice or injustice of 
the legal system, the arguments stand no chance of influencing the result.</P>
<P>Assuming for the moment that armed (or even symbolic) resistance is out of 
the question (and we should not, since the "el Barzon" movement was very 
effective in Mexico in the mid-'90s), we are left with the question of what WILL 
be effective (for the debtor, since the article I'm responding to is mostly 
about debt)?</P>
<P>Professor James C. Scott coined the term "Weapons of the Weak" for what he 
called "everyday forms of peasant resistance such as foot dragging, 
dissimulation, false compliance, pilfering, feigned ignorance, slander, arson, 
sabotage and so forth." In the United States at least, it is expected that those 
who have debts they cannot pay will declare bankruptcy (and that may well 
improve one's existence), however others choose "informal bankruptcy" which has 
been defined by Dawsey &amp; Ausubel as simply hanging up on creditors and 
ignoring their mail. Unfortunately the latter strategy opens the individual up 
to certain perils such as being sued.</P>
<P>It is at this point that the author of the article you reprinted decry the 
dearth of lawyers who will actually do them any good, claiming that all have 
been co-opted by the state. It is in a sense true that most are co-opted, but 
not by the state, rather by the creditors. It is an important distinction 
because if it were the state there would be nothing that could be done, however 
in this instance it's simply a matter of the money being in the hands of the 
other side, and there are a few lawyers (notably among them the Edelman, Combs 
firm in the Chicago area) who actually do good work for the consumer and make a 
good living at it. Most creditors have poorly prepared cases that suffer from 
any of a number of flaws, notably the inadmissibility of the evidence of the 
debt due to the impracticality of bringing to each and every debt case the 
testimony of the live witnesses who could support the admission of even perfect 
records. Secondarily, many cases are brought by creditors after the statute of 
limitations has already run--they are too old for a court to recognize. There 
are also mechanisms debtors may use such as "accord and satisfaction" checks as 
well as hard-nosed negotiating--the other side knows how weak the really are and 
will often settle as low as twenty cents on the dollar. Many debtors share 
information with one another on any number of online bulletin boards, and some 
have made a profitable proposition of suing collectors under various laws that 
protect consumers such as the FCRA and FDCPA, turning lemons not into lemonade 
but into a fermented, toxic counter-weapon.</P>
<P>I have written an eBook, "Debt Hope: Down and Dirty Survival Strategies" that 
explodes nearly all of the myths and provides the reader with practical 
solutions. You can read it for free here: <A href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/25443175/Debt-Hope-Down-and-Dirty-Survival-Strategies-Evaluation-Version-Complete">http://www.scribd.com/doc/25443175/Debt-Hope-Down-and-Dirty-Survival-Strategies-Evaluation-Version-Complete</A></P></DIV>

<P>I’m trying to understand the way he describes it myself, however,</P>
<P>A simple analogy may help to clarify.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Say for example there’s only a few people on earth.  You, me, a judge and a 
couple of cops with guns and a cell.</P>
<P></P>
<P>You arrive on Gods earth.  The judge and I inform you that we own you and you 
must pay us money for the privilege.</P>
<P>You ask for proof that may be legally tested in a court of law.  Of course, 
there is none, and can never be.</P>
<P>Sure the cops can drag you off at the Judge’s order, but that again would not 
stand up as “Legal” in an honest legal system.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In order to get our will over you, we must get you to enter an agreement. 
That is, agree that you are owned by us and owe us money.</P>
<P>Dishonoured agreements (i.e. contracts) can then be brought before our court 
in the form of a broken obligation agreed to.</P>
<P></P>
<P>As I and the judge cannot claim agreement with you prior to your birth or 
prior to talking to you,</P>
<P>an “account” (read: contract) must be setup by us to represent you in our 
legal system (Name in capital Letters in our account, because it’s not 
authorised by you), then you must be tricked into admitting you are responsible 
for it.</P>
<P></P>
<P>It’s a fundamental flaw in all (honest) legal systems</P></DIV>

<P>I have enjoyed your essays for years. I just read the "Legal Fiction" piece. 
I did some study on this topic and how it relates to federal income taxes and it 
can get confusing. I was not making any progress with the taxing authorities but 
then I discovered the book Cracking the Code by Pete Hendrickson. He has also 
written 2 other books you would really enjoy and learn a lot from. Please check 
out his website at www.losthorizons.com . The website is huge but you will gain 
the most from reading Cracking the Code (CTC) as the most important info is in 
the book, not the website. I am not affiliated with the author in anyway, I just 
recommend his books and info. Over $10.5 million has been returned to it's 
rightful owners by filing educated tax returns.</P></DIV>

<P>If you want to know just how the lawyers work click on this link. John has 
been fighting the banks in Australia for 10 years.</P>
<P></P>
<P>When you hire a lawyer you declare yourself mentally incompetent and a ‘ward 
of the court/state’. You effectively sign over all your rights to the lawyer who 
is also sworn to always work in the best interests of the court/state and NOT in 
the best interests of the client.</P>
<P></P>
<P>So, once you hire a lawyer you are done. They just play a pantomime in front 
of you to make you believe something like justice has occurred. Why do you think 
we have so many ‘law’ shows? It’s is to brainwash the people that something like 
justice occurs in the courts. It doesn’t. It’s all a con.</P>
<P></P>
<P>I propose to take my lawyers in Australia to a common law court for 
non-disclosure and let the common law court determine the penalty. I will ask 
for all my fees back $A45,000 plus interest plus another $A50K in damages. We 
will see how the lawyers like that! ;-)</P>
