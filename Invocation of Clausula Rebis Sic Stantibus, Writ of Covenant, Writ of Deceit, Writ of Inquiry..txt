Whereas, a fundamental change of circumstances is now pre-sent in pure speech in
the role of liberal constructionist/beadle jus, it is my desirous, willful wish to settle
this matter fiat justitia ruat caelum, denique ultimatum revereor verum. A fraud
revealed is null and void, nunc pro tunc, ab initio, ad infinitum.
Whereas my "Starr contract"/Long Form Birth Certificate is in custody with the
Registrar General and given under SEAL of the General Registrar Office, Belfast,
Northern Ireland as claimed on the "certified copy", my original copy has not been
deposited in a lawful repository, namely the King's Exchequor at Westminster as
commanded by Richard the First. It is my rightful duty to inform all parties/pirates
who have laid fraudulent claim to my "stock" as per Black's Law 9th Edition, WEST ,
"stock, n. (l4c) 1. The original progenitor of a family; a person from whom a family is descended"
where inasmuch, subrogation is present. I am the stock of my Mother/Father,
self-evident in the blood/aether in my lineage/veins, mitochondrial DNA "delta 9
Lucifer delta 10 mdna" from my Mother which is prima facie evidence of my
bloodline (rhA+) where my Father is the beneficiary of any/all ascendants borne to
him. The Father (semen*) of any/all borne to him render him the beneficiary only,
whereas the Mother is fiduciary.
* ward of admiralty, A seaman - so called because of the legal view that a seaman,
in contractual matters, should be treated as a beneficiary and the other contracting
party as a fiduciary because of the perceived inequitability of their bargaining
positions. [Cases: Seamen (;::J 1.]
Whereas the "surname" is assumed "automatic" at birth, inasmuch as my Mother
adopted my Father’s surname upon marriage, my living blood could be/was
kidnapped by Caesarian and I was taken from my natural jurisdiction to be willfully
enslaved into another "legal/corporate/dead" jurisdiction against my free will
choice/jus praesens via deceptios, via wrongful assumpsit.
Whereas the mistaken assumption has been made that I am, assumed in some way
to be related to the CROWN, I attest this to be untrue where the blood in my veins is
mine, self-evident as living aether without which I would cease to be, given to me
from my Mother/Father. My father is the beneficiary of me and my mother is
fiduciary where I am not the beneficiary/fiduciary to them, nor do I claim any of
their inheritance where I am their inheritance to which they are my heir, not the
other way around. Based on this deceptios, my Mother’s/Fathers’ inheritance, as
beneficiary/fiduciary was stolen by those unlawfully claiming my Mothers’/Fathers’
creation via deceptios.
Furthermore, I lay no claim to my mother’s/father’s estate where I may be
mistakenly assumed to be beneficiary to any/all titles, names, surnames, debts,
liability et al etc. where I hereby invoke **Beneficium Abstinendi ab initio, ad
infinitum, nunc pro tunc.
**Beneficium: A PRIVELEGE, remedy, or benefit GRANTED by law, such as the
BENEFICIUM ABSTINENDI "privelege of abstaining" by which an HEIR could REFUSE
to accept an INHERITANCE (and thereby avoid the accompanying debt). Beneficium
Abstinendi: "privelege of abstaining" : The RIGHT of an HEIR to REFUSE an
inheritance and thus avoid liability for the TESTATOR's debts.
Furthermore, my fathers’ estate/beneficiary status as well as my Mothers’ fiduciary
status was/is/has been willfully stolen via deceptios by any/all parties/pirates by
any/all use of the/my private name and birth/vinta/starr date given to me, removed
by way of kidnapping/shanghaiing me from my natural jurisdiction where the
creation of the “Short Form” Birth Certificate is prima facie evidence of this “private
to public” fraud absolute, where my long form birth certificate continues to remain
unlawful until it is placed in a lawful repository. Any/all use of this name in the
PUBLIC has/is/will be fraud ab initio, ad infinitum, nunc pro tunc until ***lawfully
deposited. The DTC at 55 Water Street is not a lawful repository but is rather a
“customs/bonding warehouse” where true customs have been subrogated.
Wade hearing. (1969) Criminal law. A pretrial hearing in which the defendant
contests the validity of his or her out-of-court identification. - If the court
finds that the identification was tainted bv unconstitutional methods, the
prosecution cannot ~use the identification and must link the defendant to the crime
by other means. United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926 (1967). [Cases:

*** starr (stahr), n. [fr. Latin starrum fr. Hebrew sh'tar "a writing"] Hist. A Jewish
contract (esp. for release of an obligation) that Richard I declared to be invalid
unless it was placed in a lawful repository, the largest being in the king's Exchequer
at Westminster. Also termed starra.
"It is well known that, before the banishment of the Jews under Edward I, their
contracts and obligations were denominated in our ancient records starra or starrs,
from a corruption of the Hebrew word, sheeay, a covenant .... These starrs, by an
ordinance of Richard the first ... were commanded to be enrolled and deposited in
chests under three keys in certain places; one, and the most considerable, of which
was in the king's exchequer at Westminster .... The room at the exchequer, where
the chests containing these starrs were kept, was probably called the starr-chamber,
and, when the Jews were expelled from the kingdom, was applied to the use of the
king's council, when sitting in their judicial capacity." 4 William Blackstone,
Commentaries on the Laws of England 263 n.a (I 769).
In summary, the ruse perpetuated on myself and mankind is exposed for the
mis-take it is; pure fraud ab initio, ad infinitum, nunc pro tunc where it is now
incumbent upon those responsible/Re-spawns-Abel for this fraud to *emmendatio all
mistakes created via this fraud lest this mis-take continue. All evidence has been
collected where it is now pre-sent for you such as my living blood/aether which is
“prima facie” proof of stock as well as the Long Form (as yet unlawful) connected to
Short Form (proof of public fraud) in my physical presence. By commission or
omission of any/all crimes, one is guilty where the crime is brought into view for all
to see.
* emendatio (ee-men-day-shee-oh), n. [Latin] Hist. The power of amending and
correcting abuses, according to certain rules and measures.
In conclusion, much knowing has been revealed to me in my own genesis to
revelation. It is my desirous, willful wish for you to investigate the following:
My “original source” contract is not deposited in a lawful repository. I have attached
a photocopy/scan containing my receipt (BC Short Form) so you may further
investigate and inspect the following:
The Terra-Cross (CRSS) dotted line covenant on the “original source”
contract/covenant: “19…………”
My “original source” contract shows the Birth date/Starr date was never corporate
jurisdiction(dotted line, pass through to private) and was never meant or intended
to be made PUBLIC (short form fraud) where this private matter is concerned, where
my mother/father were removed from the short form creating an
abomination/dead/corporate fiction, therefore;
The UNITED KINGDOM OF ENGLAND, WALES, SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND,
CROWN CORPORATION etc. et al and later, CANADA, ONTARIO, falsely laid claims to
being related or joined to the estate/myself, disposing the need for testatory
capacity, creating a situation where they would be/are benefiting from unjust
enrichment via theft.
The UNITED KINGDOM OF ENGLAND, WALES, SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND,
CROWN CORPORATION etc. et al and later CANADA, ONTARIO, are with “unclean
hands”, using false documents, moved me/kidnapped me as a child into a different
unnatural jurisdiction, forcing me to pay their taxes, tariffs plus levies etc. et al,
creating much hardship for myself and all in my life, while another party/parties
have been/are benefiting from unjust enrichment due to this creation of literal
slavery with the kidnapping of me from my Mother/Father on June 18th, 1964, 3 days
AFTER the prima facie evidence of my blood was already proofed.
The UNITED KINGDOM OF ENGLAND, WALES, SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND,
CROWN CORPORATION etc. et al and later CANADA, ONTARIO, denied my easement
on the land.
The UNITED KINGDOM OF ENGLAND, WALES, SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND,
CROWN CORPORATION etc. et al and later CANADA, ONTARIO, removed my “guest
status” not allowing me to seek damages.
The UNITED KINGDOM OF ENGLAND, WALES, SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND
and later CANADA, ONTARIO, falsely labeled the estate, creating a trademark,
shanghaiing me into using it for identification, defrauding me and The Laws and
Customs, forcing me to conduct trade, while benefitting from unjust enrichment.
I am submitting to your department a photocopy of the “Birth Certificate” (both
forms) to be used only for your inspection in this matter. Should you require the
original “copy” please contact me.

Clausula rebus sic stantibus/CRSS/the “cross to bare”: A treaty provision
stating that the treaty is binding only as long as the circumstances in existence
when the treaty was signed remain substantially the same. Therefore, every
contract created with their Trademark is fraudulent, ab initio, ad infinitum, nunc pro

I accept the full character of creator/creditor dominii, entirely. (toto genere)
My willful intent is peaceful. It is my wish for my “guest status” to be returned.
It is my wish to receive your assistance in getting full restitution/emendatio. That’s
the long and short of it, Thank you.
