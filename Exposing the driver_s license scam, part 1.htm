            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">Subject: Exposing 
            the driver's license scam, part 1<BR>Date: Thu, 09 Oct 2008</P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">9 October A.D. 
            2008</P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">For the students of 
            the driver's license scam.</P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">The system abuses 
            pro se's as a matter of course. The problem is that not enough of us 
            who are interested in doing something about it or are in a position 
            to do something about it. May this close that gap just that much 
            more.</P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">To understand the 
            "funny money" scam is to understand the foundation for everything 
            that vexes us.</P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">There has to be a 
            separate "place" for the "funny money" scam, or else the people 
            behind it would go to jail for fraud (among other possible criminal 
            charges). That separate "place" is a "Constitution-free, maritime, 
            commercial zone."</P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">There's one and 
            only one reason for a "license:" the engagement of commerce in "this 
            state." To get to the quintessential point by way of illustration, a 
            cab driver who is "off duty" doesn't need a "driver's license." When 
            he's "off duty," he's not engaging in the commercial activity of 
            "driving," or as may be the more correct term for statutory 
            analysis, "operating." The vehicle is "commerce ready," and he's 
            "commerce ready," but unless and until he's actually engaging in the 
            commercial activity known generally as "transportation," he's not 
            engaging in any regulated commercial activity. So, unless and until 
            there's commercial activity at issue, specifically "transportation" 
            of people or goods, in "this state," "for profit or hire," then 
            there is nothing going on that requires having a "license."</P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">The "driver's 
            license" isn't really used for a "license," anyway. I don't know the 
            exact figures, but to pull figures out of the air to illustrate the 
            point, 99% of the people who get from here to there by car are not 
            engaging in commercial activity. Thus, the main purpose of the 
            "driver's license" is that of an "ID card." To charge someone 
            criminally because that person has exercised his prerogatives of (1) 
            not engaging in the "transportation" business, (2) not adopting the 
            "choice of law" of the "place" called "this state," and, most 
            critically, (3) not signing up to be a member of "church of STATE OF 
            _______," is to commit a federal, felony, criminal act. The civil 
            remedies for those criminal acts include suits under 42 U.S.C. § 
            1983.</P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">To expand the study 
            one step, "speed limits" are for */commercial/* traffic. That's the 
            only type of traffic that any STATE has authority to regulate.</P>
            <P align="left" style="font-family: sans-serif;">There's a 
            responsibility that comes with Liberty. Be sensible in the 
            application of these concepts. To abuse it is to ruin it for 
            everyone.</P>
