        Revenue Code of 1986, and the cost-sharing reductions under section 
        1402, that would have been provided for the fiscal year to eligible 
        individuals enrolled in standard health plans in the State if such 
        eligible individuals were allowed to enroll in qualified health plans 
        through an Exchange established under this subtitle.</P>
        <P>(ii) SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS- The Secretary shall make the 
        determination under clause (i) on a per enrollee basis and shall take 
        into account all relevant factors necessary to determine the value of 
        the premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions that would have been 
        provided to eligible individuals described in clause (i), including the 
        age and income of the enrollee, whether the enrollment is for self-only 
        or family coverage, geographic differences in average spending for 
        health care across rating areas, the health status of the enrollee for 
        purposes of determining risk adjustment payments and reinsurance 
        payments that would have been made if the enrollee had enrolled in a 
        qualified health plan through an Exchange, and whether any 
        reconciliation of the credit or cost-sharing reductions would have 
        occurred if the enrollee had been so enrolled. This determination shall 
        take into consideration the experience of other States with respect to 
        participation in an Exchange and such credits and reductions provided to

        used to make determinations under this subparagraph, and such

      <P>(B) CORRECTIONS- The Secretary shall adjust the payment for any fiscal 
      year to reflect any error in the determinations under subparagraph (A) for 
      any preceding fiscal year.</P></UL>
    <P>(4) APPLICATION OF SPECIAL RULES- The provisions of section 1303 shall 
    apply to a State basic health program, and to standard health plans offered

    A law that mandates health insurance coverage or reimbursement for services 
    provided by certain classes of providers of health care services, or a law 
    that mandates that certain classes of individuals must be covered as a group 
    or as dependents, is not a State law mandating benefit coverage by a health 
    benefits plan.</P></UL></UL>

<P>
<H3>SEC. 1501. REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE.</H3>
<UL>
  <P>(a) Findings- Congress makes the following findings:</P>
  <UL>
    <P>(1) IN GENERAL- The individual responsibility requirement provided for in 
    this section (in this subsection referred to as the ‘requirement’) is 
    commercial and economic in nature, and substantially affects interstate 
    commerce, as a result of the effects described in paragraph (2).</P>
    <P>(2) EFFECTS ON THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND INTERSTATE COMMERCE- The effects 
    described in this paragraph are the following:</P>
    <UL>
      <P>(A) The requirement regulates activity that is commercial and economic 
      in nature: economic and financial decisions about how and when health care 
      is paid for, and when health insurance is purchased.</P>
      <P>(B) Health insurance and health care services are a significant part of 
      the national economy. National health spending is projected to increase 
      from $2,500,000,000,000, or 17.6 percent of the economy, in 2009 to 
      $4,700,000,000,000 in 2019. Private health insurance spending is projected 
      to be $854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays for medical supplies, drugs, and 
      equipment that are shipped in interstate commerce. Since most health 
      insurance is sold by national or regional health insurance companies, 
      health insurance is sold in interstate commerce and claims payments flow 
      through interstate commerce.</P>
      <P>(C) The requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, 
      will add millions of new consumers to the health insurance market, 
      increasing the supply of, and demand for, health care services. According 
      to the Congressional Budget Office, the requirement will increase the 
      number and share of Americans who are insured.</P>
      <P>(D) The requirement achieves near-universal coverage by building upon 
      and strengthening the private employer-based health insurance system, 
      which covers 176,000,000 Americans nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar 
      requirement has strengthened private employer-based coverage: despite the 
      economic downturn, the number of workers offered employer-based coverage 
      has actually increased.</P>
      <P>(E) Half of all personal bankruptcies are caused in part by medical 
      expenses. By significantly increasing health insurance coverage, the 
      requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will improve 
      financial security for families.</P>
      <P>(F) Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 
      U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et 
      seq.), and this Act, the Federal Government has a significant role in 
      regulating health insurance which is in interstate commerce.</P>
      <P>(G) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public Health Service Act (as 
      added by section 1201 of this Act), if there were no requirement, many 
      individuals would wait to purchase health insurance until they needed 
      care. By significantly increasing health insurance coverage, the 
      requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will minimize 
      this adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk pool to 
      include healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance premiums. 
      The requirement is essential to creating effective health insurance 
      markets in which improved health insurance products that are guaranteed 
      issue and do not exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can be 
      sold.</P>
      <P>(H) Administrative costs for private health insurance, which were 
      $90,000,000,000 in 2006, are 26 to 30 percent of premiums in the current 
      individual and small group markets. By significantly increasing health 
      insurance coverage and the size of purchasing pools, which will increase 
      economies of scale, the requirement, together with the other provisions of 
      this Act, will significantly reduce administrative costs and lower health 
      insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating effective 
      health insurance markets that do not require underwriting and eliminate 
      its associated administrative costs.</P></UL>
    <P>(3) SUPREME COURT RULING- In United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters 
    Association (322 U.S. 533 (1944)), the Supreme Court of the United States 
    ruled that insurance is interstate commerce subject to Federal 
    regulation.</P></UL>
  <P>(b) In General- Subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended 
  by adding at the end the following new chapter:</P></UL>

        individual and, in the case of an individual in a family greater than 1, 
        the household income of such family. A State shall establish income

    rather than in an institutional setting.</P>
    <P>(3) Despite the Pepper Commission and Olmstead decision, the long-term 
    care provided to our Nation’s elderly and disabled has not improved. In 
    fact, for many, it has gotten far worse.</P>
    <P>(4) In 2007, 69 percent of Medicaid long-term care spending for elderly 
    individuals and adults with physical disabilities paid for institutional 
    services. Only 6 states spent 50 percent or more of their Medicaid long-term 
    care dollars on home and community-based services for elderly individuals 
    and adults with physical disabilities while  1/2  of the States spent less 
    than 25 percent. This disparity continues even though, on average, it is 
    estimated that Medicaid dollars can support nearly 3 elderly individuals and 
    adults with physical disabilities in home and community-based services for 
    every individual in a nursing home. Although every State has chosen to 
    provide certain services under home and community-based waivers, these 
    services are unevenly available within and across States, and reach a small 
    percentage of eligible individuals.</P></UL>
  <P>(b) Sense of the Senate- It is the sense of the Senate that--</P>
  <UL>
    <P>(1) during the 111th session of Congress, Congress should address 
    long-term services and supports in a comprehensive way that guarantees 
    elderly and disabled individuals the care they need; and</P>
    <P>(2) long term services and supports should be made available in the 
    community in addition to in institutions.</P></UL></UL>

    <P>(1) The demonstration project shall be conducted in up to 8 States, 
    determined by the Secretary based on consideration of the potential to lower 
    costs under the Medicaid program while improving care for Medicaid 
    beneficiaries. A State selected to participate in the demonstration project 
    may target the demonstration project to particular categories of 
    beneficiaries, beneficiaries with particular diagnoses, or particular 
    geographic regions of the State, but the Secretary shall insure that, as a 
    whole, the demonstration project is, to the greatest extent possible, 
    representative of the demographic and geographic composition of Medicaid 
    beneficiaries nationally.</P>

    evidence of an opportunity for providers of services and suppliers to 
    improve the quality of care furnished to Medicaid beneficiaries while 
    reducing total expenditures under the State Medicaid programs selected to 
    participate, as determined by the Secretary.</P>
    <P>(3) A State selected to participate in the demonstration project shall

    participating in the demonstration project.</P>
    <P>(4) The Secretary shall ensure that payments made under the demonstration 
    project are adjusted for severity of illness and other characteristics of 
    Medicaid beneficiaries within a category or having a diagnosis targeted as 
    part of the demonstration project. States shall ensure that Medicaid 
    beneficiaries are not liable for any additional cost sharing than if their 
    care had not been subject to payment under the demonstration project.</P>

    establish robust discharge planning programs to ensure that Medicaid 
    beneficiaries requiring post-acute care are appropriately placed in, or have 
    ready access to, post-acute care settings.</P>
    <P>(6) The Secretary and each State selected to participate in the 
    demonstration project shall ensure that the demonstration project does not 
    result in the Medicaid beneficiaries whose care is subject to payment under 
    the demonstration project being provided with less items and services for 
    which medical assistance is provided under the State Medicaid program than 
    the items and services for which medical assistance would have been provided 
    to such beneficiaries under the State Medicaid program in the absence of the 
    demonstration project.</P></UL>
  <P>(c) Waiver of Provisions- Notwithstanding section 1115(a) of the Social 
  Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1315(a)), the Secretary may waive such provisions of

    demonstration project, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress on 
    the results of the demonstration project.</P></UL></UL>

      benefit plans as alternatives for consideration for designation by the 
      Secretary as the CLASS Independence Benefit Plan under which eligible 
      beneficiaries shall receive benefits under this title. Each of the plan 
      alternatives developed shall be designed to provide eligible beneficiaries 
      with the benefits described in section 3205 consistent with the following 
      requirements:</P>
      <UL>
        <P>‘(A) PREMIUMS-</P>
        <UL>
          <P>‘(i) IN GENERAL- Beginning with the first year of the CLASS 
          program, and for each year thereafter, subject to clauses (ii) and 
          (iii), the Secretary shall establish all premiums to be paid by 
          enrollees for the year based on an actuarial analysis of the 75-year 
          costs of the program that ensures solvency throughout such 75-year 
          period.</P>

            determined under subclause (II) for--</P></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL>

          Independence Fund would not decrease in that year. At such time as the 
          Secretary determines the CLASS program demonstrates a sustained 
          ability to finance expected yearly expenses with expected yearly 
          premiums and interest credited to the CLASS Independence Fund, the

      <P>‘(3) AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH SEPARATE ENTITIES- The Director may

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H3>‘SEC. 1416. STUDY OF GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN APPLICATION OF FPL.</H3>
  <UL>
    <P>‘(a) In General- The Secretary shall conduct a study to examine the 
    feasibility and implication of adjusting the application of the Federal 
    poverty level under this subtitle (and the amendments made by this subtitle) 
    for different geographic areas so as to reflect the variations in 
    cost-of-living among different areas within the United States. If the 
    Secretary determines that an adjustment is feasible, the study should 
    include a methodology to make such an adjustment. Not later than January 1, 
    2013, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on such study and 
    shall include such recommendations as the Secretary determines 
    appropriate.</P>
    <P>‘(b) Inclusion of Territories-</P>

      <P>‘(1) IN GENERAL- The Secretary shall ensure that the study under

      special attention is paid to the disparity that exists among poverty 
      levels and the cost of living in such territories and to the impact of 
      such disparity on efforts to expand health coverage and ensure health 
      care.</P>
      <P>‘(2) TERRITORIES DEFINED- In this subsection, the term ‘territories of 
      the United States’ includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United 
      States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other

<H3>SEC. 10106. AMENDMENTS TO SUBTITLE F.</H3>
<UL>
  <P>(a) Section 1501(a)(2) of this Act is amended to read as follows:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
      <P>‘(2) EFFECTS ON THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND INTERSTATE COMMERCE- The 
      effects described in this paragraph are the following:</P>
      <UL>
        <P>‘(A) The requirement regulates activity that is commercial and 
        economic in nature: economic and financial decisions about how and when 
        health care is paid for, and when health insurance is purchased. In the 
        absence of the requirement, some individuals would make an economic and 
        financial decision to forego health insurance coverage and attempt to 
        self-insure, which increases financial risks to households and medical 
        providers.</P>
        <P>‘(B) Health insurance and health care services are a significant part 
        of the national economy. National health spending is projected to 
        increase from $2,500,000,000,000, or 17.6 percent of the economy, in 
        2009 to $4,700,000,000,000 in 2019. Private health insurance spending is 
        projected to be $854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays for medical supplies, 
        drugs, and equipment that are shipped in interstate commerce. Since most 
        health insurance is sold by national or regional health insurance 
        companies, health insurance is sold in interstate commerce and claims 
        payments flow through interstate commerce.</P>
        <P>‘(C) The requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, 
        will add millions of new consumers to the health insurance market, 
        increasing the supply of, and demand for, health care services, and will 
        increase the number and share of Americans who are insured.</P>
        <P>‘(D) The requirement achieves near-universal coverage by building 
        upon and strengthening the private employer-based health insurance 
        system, which covers 176,000,000 Americans nationwide. In Massachusetts, 
        a similar requirement has strengthened private employer-based coverage: 
        despite the economic downturn, the number of workers offered 
        employer-based coverage has actually increased.</P>
        <P>‘(E) The economy loses up to $207,000,000,000 a year because of the 
        poorer health and shorter lifespan of the uninsured. By significantly 
        reducing the number of the uninsured, the requirement, together with the 
        other provisions of this Act, will significantly reduce this economic 
        cost.</P>
        <P>‘(F) The cost of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured was 
        $43,000,000,000 in 2008. To pay for this cost, health care providers 
        pass on the cost to private insurers, which pass on the cost to 
        families. This cost-shifting increases family premiums by on average 
        over $1,000 a year. By significantly reducing the number of the 
        uninsured, the requirement, together with the other provisions of this 
        Act, will lower health insurance premiums.</P>
        <P>‘(G) 62 percent of all personal bankruptcies are caused in part by 
        medical expenses. By significantly increasing health insurance coverage, 
        the requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will 
        improve financial security for families.</P>
        <P>‘(H) Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 
        U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et 
        seq.), and this Act, the Federal Government has a significant role in 
        regulating health insurance. The requirement is an essential part of 
        this larger regulation of economic activity, and the absence of the 
        requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance 
        market.</P>
        <P>‘(I) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public Health Service Act 
        (as added by section 1201 of this Act), if there were no requirement, 
        many individuals would wait to purchase health insurance until they 
        needed care. By significantly increasing health insurance coverage, the 
        requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will 
        minimize this adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk 
        pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance 
        premiums. The requirement is essential to creating effective health 
        insurance markets in which improved health insurance products that are 
        guaranteed issue and do not exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions 
        can be sold.</P>
        <P>‘(J) Administrative costs for private health insurance, which were 
        $90,000,000,000 in 2006, are 26 to 30 percent of premiums in the current 
        individual and small group markets. By significantly increasing health 
        insurance coverage and the size of purchasing pools, which will increase 
        economies of scale, the requirement, together with the other provisions 
        of this Act, will significantly reduce administrative costs and lower 
        health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating 
        effective health insurance markets that do not require underwriting and 
        eliminate its associated administrative costs.’.</P></UL></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>

      items such as the following:</P>
      <UL>
        <P>‘(A) Methods to potentially revise the home health prospective 
        payment system under section 1895 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
        1395fff) to account for costs related to patient severity of illness or

          <P>‘(iii) ways outlier payments might be revised to reflect costs of 
          treating Medicare beneficiaries with high levels of severity of 
          illness; and</P>
          <P>‘(iv) other issues determined appropriate by the Secretary.</P></UL>
        <P>‘(B) Operational issues involved with potential implementation of 
        potential revisions to the home health payment system, including impacts 
        for both home health agencies and administrative and systems issues for

        revisions.</P>
        <P>‘(C) Whether additional research might be needed.</P>
        <P>‘(D) Other items determined appropriate by the Secretary.</P></UL>
      <P>‘(2) CONSIDERATIONS- In conducting the study under paragraph (1), the 
      Secretary may consider whether patient severity of illness and access to 
      care could be measured by factors, such as--</P>
      <UL>

        <P>‘(B) variations in service costs for providing care to individuals 
        who are dually eligible under the Medicare and Medicaid programs;</P>
        <P>‘(C) the presence of severe or chronic diseases, which might be 
        measured by multiple, discontinuous home health episodes;</P>
        <P>‘(D) poverty status, such as evidenced by the receipt of Supplemental 
        Security Income under title XVI of the Social Security Act; and</P>
        <P>‘(E) other factors determined appropriate by the Secretary.</P></UL>
      <P>‘(3) REPORT- Not later than March 1, 2014, the Secretary shall submit 
      to Congress a report on the study conducted under paragraph (1), together 
      with recommendations for such legislation and administrative action as the 
      Secretary determines appropriate.</P>
      <P>‘(4) CONSULTATIONS- In conducting the study under paragraph (1), the 
      Secretary shall consult with appropriate stakeholders, such as groups 
      representing home health agencies and groups representing Medicare

        results of the study conducted under paragraph (1), the Secretary may, 
        as determined appropriate, provide for a demonstration project to test 
        whether making payment adjustments for home health services under the 
        Medicare program would substantially improve access to care for patients 
        with high severity levels of illness or for low-income or underserved 
        Medicare beneficiaries.</P>
        <P>‘(B) WAIVING BUDGET NEUTRALITY- The Secretary shall not reduce the 
        standard prospective payment amount (or amounts) under section 1895 of 
        the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395fff) applicable to home health 
        services furnished during a period to offset any increase in payments
