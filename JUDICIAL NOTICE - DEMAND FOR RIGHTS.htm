      <P>Know all men by these presents, that I, John Henry; Doe, do travel upon 
      the highways and roads of these United States as a matter of asserted 
      Common Law rights. That I assert my full sovereignty as a free and natural 
      Man under the Common Law of the Constitution of the united States of 
      America, to wit: 
      <P>1. "The use of the highway for the purpose of travel and transportation
       is not a mere privilege but a common and fundamental right of which the
       public and individuals cannot rightfully be deprived." <U>Chicago Motor 
      Coach v. Chicago</U>, 337 Ill. 200, 169 NE 22, 66 ALR 834. <U>Ligare v. 
      Chicago</U>, 139 Ill. 46, 28 NE 934. <U>Boone v. Clark</U>, 214 SW 607; 25 
      AM JUR (1st) Highways, Sec.163. 
      <P>2. "The right of the citizen to travel upon the public highways and to
       transport his property thereon, either by a carriage or automobile, is 
      not a mere privilege which a City may prohibit or permit at will, but a 
      common right which he has under the right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit 
      of Happiness." <U>Thompson v. Smith</U> 154 SE 579. 
      <P>3. "The right to travel is part of the Liberty of which the citizen
       cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment." 
      <U>Kent v. Dulles</U> 357 U.S. 116, 125. 
      <P>4. "Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be
       no rule-making or legislation which would abrogate them." <U>Miranda v. 
      Arizona</U> 384 U.S. 436, 491. 
      <P>5. "The claim and exercise of a Constitutional right cannot be
       converted into a crime." <U>Miller v. U.S.</U> 230 F 2d 486, 489. 
      <P>6. "Our system of government, based upon the individuality and
       intelligence of the citizen, the state does not claim to control him, 
      except as his conduct to others, leaving him the sole judge as to all that 
      only affects himself." <U>Mugler v. Kansas</U> 123 U.S. 623, 659-6O. 
      <P>This statement has been submitted upon demand of a driver's license,
       registration, proof of insurance, and, therefore, is part of the official
       record of any ensuing action and must be introduced as evidence in said
       action. It will be noted that willful suppression of evidence is a 
      felony. 
      <P>
