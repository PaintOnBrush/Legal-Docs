<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Welcome to the United States District Court for
the District of Idaho. We have prepared this handbook
specifically for the person who has chosen, for whatever reason,
to represent himself/herself as a party to a lawsuit: the pro se
litigant. The purpose of this handbook is to provide the pro se
litigant with a practical and informative initial resource that
will assist in the decision-making process and in the filing of a
lawsuit when choosing not to retain the aid of a licensed
attorney. Many reasons exist for filing a lawsuit pro se, for
example, the litigant might feel that the cost of an attorney is
prohibitive. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The next three chapters of this handbook
provide information that you should consider before filing your
own lawsuit such as whether or not you have a case you can win,
the importance of legal counsel and the alternatives, and the
structure of the federal court system. If after considering this
information, you feel you have a case that should be filed in
federal court and you wish to represent yourself, additional
information has been provided to assist you in filing your case
and utilizing the appropriate rules of procedure for the United
States District Court for the District of Idaho. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">We have also provided an overview of legal
research and a glossary of common and foreign words regularly
used in the legal field. These tools should not be considered the
last word, nor should this entire handbook be used as your only
resource. This handbook should be considered only as the first
step in filing your own lawsuit. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">As Clerk of Court for the District of Idaho, my
deputy clerks and I are willing to assist you with questions
regarding the Local Rules of Civil Procedure and the Local Rules
of Criminal Procedure for the District of Idaho as well as the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Criminal Rules
of Procedure. However, by law we cannot answer questions of a
legal nature. Do not hesitate to call on us regarding a
procedural matter. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">We wish you the very best in your endeavor. The
mission statement for the United States District Court for the
District of Idaho is as follows: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The mission of the United States District and
Bankruptcy Courts for the District of Idaho is to provide an
impartial and accessible forum for the just, timely, and
economical resolution of legal proceedings within the
jurisdiction of the courts, so as to preserve judicial
independence, protect individual rights and liberties, and
promote public trust and confidence. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Those of us employed by the District of Idaho
take this mission statement very seriously. In order to provide
the impartial and accessible forum that you are entitled to, the
federal courts for Idaho are housed in the main courthouse in
Boise and three satellite courthouses throughout the state. The
addresses and telephone numbers are as follows: </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>THE FIVE REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF
A LAWSUIT</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are five very important elements that
must exist before you can file a case in federal court. The
following is a summary of the things you should consider before
filing a case in federal court. This summary is not to be
considered the final word. Before continuing, you must understand
that even if you have met all five elements, there is always a
possibility that you may not win. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b>THE FIVE REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF A LAWSUIT</b> </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">A. Real Injury or Wrong. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">B. Jurisdiction. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">C. Statute of Limitations. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">D. Immunity. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">E. Facts and Evidence. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="A. REAL INJURY OR WRONG."></a><font size="2"><b>A.
REAL INJURY OR WRONG.</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Cases brought by persons without counsel
typically fall into two categories: civil rights violations and
tort claims. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A <b>civil rights</b> case involves a claim
seeking redress for the violation of a person's constitutional
rights. This type of claim is often brought under the federal
statute, 42 U.S.C. S 1983. Under this law, a person who acts
under color of state law to violate another's constitutional
rights may be liable for damages. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A <b>tort</b> is defined as a &quot;private or
civil wrong or injury.&quot; It is distinguished from criminal
law because it is an injury against an individual and not the
state (city, county, or state government). If a person ran a
stoplight and hit your car, the state would ticket the driver for
running the stoplight but it would not be able to sue the driver
for the injuries received by the victim of the other car. That is
considered a private wrong or injury and it is the right of the
victim to file a <b>civil</b> suit against the driver seeking
damages for the injuries received. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are three types of torts: intentional,
negligence, and strict liability. You cannot sue someone just
because you are angry at them; you have to have been injured in
some way. You can bring a tort action in federal court if a
violation of a federal law has occurred. </font></p>

<p><a name="B. JURISDICTION"></a><font size="2"><b>B.
JURISDICTION</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Jurisdiction</b> is the authority given a
court to hear and decide certain cases. For a court to render a
valid judgment, it must have both jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the controversy and jurisdiction over the persons or
entities involved. The court system is described more fully in
Chapter IV of this handbook; however, to file a case in federal
court, you must meet at least one of two important criteria: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">1. The case must deal with a &quot;federal
    question&quot; of law; or </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">2. The parties to the case must be
    residents of different states (known as diversity of
    citizenship) and the monetary amount in controversy must
    exceed <strong>$75,000</strong></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2">Federal courts enforce &quot;federal law,&quot;
that is, the United States Constitution and federal statutes
enacted by Congress. State courts enforce state laws. Sometimes
they overlap, such as in diversity cases. This is why it is
important that legal counsel is obtained as often as possible. </font></p>

<p><a name="C. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS."></a><font size="2"><b>C.
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A <b>statute of limitations</b> is that part of
the statute that sets a particular period of time within which a
suit can be filed. It begins to run when the injury or right has
been violated. Some examples are as follows: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">1. Car accident or other personal injury: 2
    years <br>
    2. Civil rights violation: 2 years <br>
    3. Contract dispute: 6 years <br>
    4. Medical malpractice: 2 1/2 years </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="D. IMMUNITY."></a><font size="2"><b>D. IMMUNITY.</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Immunity</b> prohibits you from suing a
person who is performing his/her duties as prescribed by law.
When a judge decides a case, he is immune from suit because he is
performing the duties directed by law. However, if a judge has
operated his car illegally and caused you to be harmed, you can
sue him for damages because driving his car does not fall under
the duties of being a judge. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Most government employees are immune from suit
if they are performing their assigned duties and are not aware of
a violation of the law. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">You should realize that immunity may be a
defense that prevents a person who is sued from being liable.
There may be other legal defenses that the person can assert
which will also protect them from liability. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">All judges are subject to the Code of Conduct
for United States Judges. The Clerk of Court and Clerk's Office
staff members are subject to the Code of Conduct for Judicial
Employees. Part of the codes of conduct prohibit Clerk's Office
employees from accepting any gift, without exception, from anyone
seeking official action from or doing business with the court or
from anyone whose interests may be substantially affected by the
performance or nonperformance of official duties. This
prohibition includes accepting any sort of holiday gift, whether
intended for the Clerk's Office as a whole or for a specific
individual.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Complaints about the performance or behavior of
Clerk's Office staff should be made to the Clerk of Court or to
one of the judges. Complaints about judges' decisions on
procedural matters or the merits of disputes can only be
addressed through the regular appellate process. Any person
alleging that a judge has engaged in conduct prejudicial to the
effective and expeditious administration of the business of the
courts, or that a judge is unable to discharge all the duties of
the office by reason of mental or physical disability may file a
complaint pursuant to the Rules of the Tenth Circuit Judicial
Council Governing Complaints of Judicial Misconduct or
Disability.</font></p>

<p><a name="E. FACTS AND EVIDENCE."></a><font size="2"><b>E.
FACTS AND EVIDENCE.</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">You cannot sue someone because you believe or
you have a feeling the person has violated your rights. You must
have facts to support your lawsuit such as the time and place of
the incident, witnesses who observed the behavior, and actual
articles of evidence such as a gun or a police report or other
documentary evidence. The burden of proof is on the </font><a href="terms-op.htm#Plaintiff"><font size="2">plaintiff</font></a><font size="2"> to win the case; and without factual evidence, the case
cannot be won. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It is very important that you have all five
required elements before you consider filing a case against
someone or some entity. After all of these elements are met, you
must still follow the procedures set out for the particular court
you will file your case with. In Chapter V of this handbook, we
will discuss the rules and procedures for filing lawsuits in the
United States District Court for the District of Idaho. If your
case needs to be filed in any other court, you should contact the
clerk's office of that court for information regarding local
rules and procedures for filing your particular case. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Chapter III deals with information regarding
representation by legal counsel. Please take time to read the
information provided. There are alternatives to filing a lawsuit
on your own, and you should give these alternatives your utmost
consideration. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>REPRESENTATION BY AN
ATTORNEY: IT'S IMPORTANT</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">This handbook was developed to address the
needs of the </font><a href="terms-kl.htm#Litigant"><font size="2">litigant</font></a><font size="2"> who wishes to file a
lawsuit pro se, without the aid of an attorney. However, we feel
it is very important that the pro se litigant understand that
there are alternatives to representing yourself if you are
indigent. Additionally, there are matters that are extremely
complex and each matter deserves appropriate representation. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">In a criminal case, a defendant is entitled to
legal counsel by the United States Constitution and one can be
provided if indigence is shown on the part of the defendant.
However, in a civil case, the plaintiff is not entitled to an
attorney. There are organizations that can help obtain counsel in
civil matters for nominal fees or even on a volunteer basis. The
Idaho State Bar has a referral service that lists attorneys who
belong to the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers and they are willing to
help indigent parties in several different ways. Legal Aid
Services is also available as well as the American Civil
Liberties Union. There are also attorneys who would be willing to
represent you on a contingent fee basis where the attorney
collects a fee only if money is won in the suit. </font></p>

<p><a name="A. ALTERNATIVES TO LITIGATION IN FEDERAL COURT."></a><font size="2"><b>A. ALTERNATIVES TO LITIGATION IN FEDERAL COURT.</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Under the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990, the
United States District Court for the District of Idaho has
adopted the concept of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). ADR
provides options of resolving disputes before and/or after a
lawsuit is filed. There are many forms of ADR, and the following
is a description of the four basic forms: </font></p>

<p><a name="Arbitration"></a><font size="2"><b>1. Arbitration:</b>
A dispute resolution process in which one or more arbitrators
issue a non-binding judgment on the merits after an expedited,
adversarial hearing. The arbitrator&#146;s non-binding decision
addresses only the disputed legal issues and applies legal
standards. Either party may reject the non-binding ruling and
request a trial de novo in district court within 30 days of the
arbitrator&#146;s decision. If they do not request trial de novo
and do not attempt settlement, the arbitrator&#146;s decision
becomes the final, non-appealable decision. </font></p>

<p><a name="Mediation"></a><font size="2"><b>2. Mediation:</b> A
flexible, non-binding dispute resolution process in which an
impartial neutral third party--the mediator--facilitates
negotiations among the parties to help them reach settlement. A
hallmark of mediation is its capacity to expand traditional
settlement discussions and broaden resolution options, often by
going beyond the legal issues in controversy. In the District of
Idaho, all civil cases except prisoner petitions, Social
Security, student loan recovery, Medicare, forfeiture, Bankruptcy
appeals, federal tax suits, Federal Tort Claims Act cases in
excess of $1 million, cases involving Temporary Restraining
Orders, Preliminary Injunctions or other extraordinary injunctive
relief will be automatically assigned to mediation. In addition,
all Bankruptcy adversary proceedings and contested cases shall be
eligible for assignment to mediation. A party will be allowed to
&#147;opt out&#148; of the mediation process only upon
successfully demonstrating to the Court by motion that
&#147;compelling reasons&#148; exist as to why this mediation
should not occur or could not possibly be productive. Mediation
is governed by General Order #130.</font></p>

<p><a name="Settlement"></a><font size="2"><b>3. Settlement</b>
Pursuant to </font><a href="lr-p1-8.htm#RULE 68.1"><font size="2">Local
Rule 68.1</font></a><font size="2">, Settlement Conferences, the
parties </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Conference: are required to explore the
possibility of settlement prior to trial. At any time after an
action or proceeding is at issue, any party may file a request
for, or the assigned judge on his own initiative may order a
settlement conference. A conference is then held before an
assigned judge who facilitates the parties to come to settlement.
All information provided to the settlement judge is confidential.
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The purpose of ADR is to provide an incentive
for the speedy, fair, and economical resolution of controversies
by informal procedures while preserving the right to a
conventional trial. There is no penalty for non-participation in
these programs or for not accepting the decision/award. Parties
retain the right for a trial de novo. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">You should be aware that, in some instances, it
is necessary for you to pursue all remedies that may be available
before you can pursue a claim in court. There are two areas in
particular where this is likely to arise: (1) if you are
appealing an agency decision, or (2) if you are seeking a writ of
habeas corpus in the federal court. </font></p>

Administrative Grievance Procedures. </b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Often times people want to appeal the decision
of some governmental agency that affects them. An example of this
is in the area of </font><a href="terms-st.htm#Social Security"><font size="2">Social Security</font></a><font size="2"> benefits. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">If you want to </font><a href="terms-ab.htm#Appeal"><font size="2">appeal </font></a><font size="2">the denial of some benefit that is provided through an
agency of the United States government or the state of Idaho, you
must pursue all of the administrative procedures which are set up
by the agency before you can bring a lawsuit. Only after you have
pursued and exhausted the administrative procedure will the court
have jurisdiction to hear a claim. </font></p>

<p><a name="2. Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus."></a><font size="2"><b>2. Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus. </b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">A person who is incarcerated or is otherwise in
custody pursuant to court order may wish to challenge the fact or
duration of his confinement. Such a challenge would be brought as
a petition for writ of habeas corpus against the person or entity
who holds them in custody, e.g., state or county. If the person
can successfully show that a constitutional right was violated,
which would have otherwise prevented the incarceration
(&quot;fact of incarceration&quot;) or the duration of the
incarceration the court will grant a writ of habeas corpus. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">However, before such a petition can be filed in
the federal court, the petitioner must pursue and exhaust all
available state law remedies. This means that if you want to
challenge a conviction or a sentence, you must pursue your right
of appeal under Idaho law. This may be accomplished in two ways:
(1) the direct right of appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court, or (2)
by filing a petition for post-conviction relief in the state
district court followed by an appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court.
Only after you have fully pursued the available state law
remedies will you be eligible to pursue a federal petition for
writ of habeas corpus. </font></p>

IV.</b> </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>THE STRUCTURE OF THE COURTS</b><br>
<b>OR<br>
SHOULD THIS CASE BE FILED IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT?</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are two court systems in the United
States: the state courts and the federal courts. The state courts
typically hear matters relating to civil, criminal, domestic
(divorce and child custody), </font><a href="terms-op.htm#Probate"><font size="2">probate</font></a><font size="2">, and property in accordance with the laws of each
state. Matters typically heard by the federal courts involve
violation of federal laws; admiralty and maritime matters; United
States patent, trademark, and copyright matters; bankruptcy
proceedings; proceedings against ambassadors, consuls, and
ministers. These matters usually fall into two main categories:
(1) federal question cases -- cases which arise under the
Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States; and (2)
diversity cases -- civil matters arising between parties who are
citizens of different states and the amount in controversy
exceeds $75,000.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Remember, in Chapter II we discussed the five
required elements of a lawsuit. Before filing a case in a federal
court, you must decide if the court has jurisdiction.
Jurisdiction is the authority given a court to hear and decide
certain cases. The United States Supreme Court is given its
authority by Article III of the United States Constitution. There
may be instances when the United States Supreme Court might
review a judgment rendered by a state court, but those instances
are rare, occurring only when there has been a final judgment or
decree of the highest court of the state in which a decision
could be had involving a substantial federal question. Normally,
the United States Supreme Court reviews judgments rendered by the
United States Courts of Appeals, of which there are thirteen
federal judicial circuits. The United States Supreme Court has
original jurisdiction over matters involving treason and
presidential impeachment. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The following are all of the other federal
courts which are established and given their authority by acts of
Congress enacted under constitutional authority. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">o United States Courts of Appeals: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">- The Courts of Appeals for the District of
Columbia and for the First through the Eleventh Circuits hear
appeals from the federal district courts, bankruptcy courts, and
tax courts. They also review some decisions of various federal
administrative agencies. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">- The United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit hears appeals from final decisions of federal
district courts for civil actions arising under any Act of
Congress relating to patents, plant variety protection,
copyrights and trademarks, including claims of unfair competition
when joined with substantial and related claims dealing with
patents, copyrights, etc. as well as the final decisions of the
district courts and the United States Claims Court where the
United States is sued as defendant, and appeals from decisions of
the United States Court of International Trade, and United States
Patent and Trademark Office, the United States International
Trade Commission relating to unfair import practices, and
decisions by the Secretary of Commerce relating to import
tariffs, among others. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">o United States Court of Military Appeals. This
court hears appeals from court martial decisions. There is no
further appeal from this court. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">o United States Claims Court. This court hears
certain kinds of actions against the United States Government,
except those involving tort claims under the Federal Tort Claims
Act. These cases may be appealed to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">o Tax Court of the United States. This court
hears cases concerning the federal tax laws. Its decisions may be
appealed to the United States Court of Appeals. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">o United States Court of International Trade.
This court hears cases concerning the federal tariff laws. Its
decisions may be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">o United States Bankruptcy Courts. These courts
hear all matters pertaining to bankruptcy and financial
reorganization. Their decisions may be appealed to the United
States District Court and, in some cases, to the appropriate
United States Court of Appeals. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">o United States District Courts. These courts
try both criminal and civil actions and sit as admiralty courts.
They may also review decisions of federal administrative
agencies. There is at least one United States District Court in
each state. Their decisions may be appealed to the appropriate
United States Court of Appeals. </font></p>

determine if all discovery has been completed, what exhibits and

parties when they feel a prospective juror would be detrimental
to their side of this case. </font></p>

    facts to be admitted into evidence--such as insurance
    policies, subsequent marriages, criminal records, and other
    matters which are either not relevant to the particular case
    involved or which might influence the jury unfairly. </font></p>
    <p><a name="2. Motion for Instructed or Directed"></a><font size="2"><b>2. Motion for Instructed or Directed Verdict:</b>
    This motion is usually made by the defendant at the close of
    evidence presented by the plaintiff&#146;s side and is based
    on the premise that the plaintiff has failed to prove his
    case. If it is granted, the court instructs the jury to
    render a verdict for the defendant and against the plaintiff,
    and the trial is concluded in the defendant&#146;s favor. If
    the court denies the motion, the trial continues with
    presentation of the defendant&#146;s side. </font></p>

    if, for example, during the course of the trial certain
    matters which are not admissible such as those mentioned in a
    motion for limine are presented by any witness either
    purposely or unintentionally in the presence of the jury. If
    the jury grants the motion for mistrial, the trial is

    testimony or evidence about to be given should be excluded.
    If the objection is sustained by the judge, that particular
    testimony or evidence is excluded. If the objection is
    overruled by the judge, the testimony or evidence may be
    given. A ruling on an objection may be the basis for appeal;
    however, in order to preserve the right to appeal, a party
    must ask the court recorder that that portion of the
    trial--the question/evidence, the objection, and the ruling--
    be transcribed in order to <i>preserve the record</i> for

the form of written instructions. Each side may present proposed
written instructions to the judge for consideration. After the
judge has considered all proposed instructions, the jury is given
each instruction which sets forth the jury&#146;s responsibility
to decide the facts in light of the applicable rules of law. The
jury then returns a verdict granting favor to the plaintiff or

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>LEGAL RESEARCH -- AN OVERVIEW</b>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">It is not the purpose of this chapter to teach
the pro se litigant legal research and writing nor is it our goal
to sort out the complexities of applying the law, whether it be
statutory or case law, to the facts of a particular case. The law
prohibits personnel in the Clerk's office from providing
information regarding the application of the law to the facts of
any case. The intention here is to provide information that is
basic to a law library to be used as a guideline. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Just as there are certain standards of
procedure for filing documents with the Clerk's office, there are
certain standards for citing authority when applying the law to
the facts of a certain case. The most common source of citation
standards is A Uniform System of Citation, Fifteenth Edition,
published and distributed by The Harvard Law Review Association,
Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is more commonly referred to as
&quot;The Bluebook&quot; and sometimes as the &quot;The Harvard
Citator.&quot; All of the information required for proper
citation format can be found in this one text. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Authority is the information used to convince a
court how to apply the law to the facts of a case. Legal
authority is divided into two classes -- primary and secondary.
There are two sources of primary authority: (1) constitutions,
codes, statutes, and ordinances; and (2) court decisions,
preferably from the same jurisdiction where the case is filed.
Secondary authority, which is not cited except in certain
circumstances, is found in legal encyclopedias, legal texts,
treatises, law review articles, and court cases in other
jurisdictions. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">- Primary authority is the most accepted form
of authority cited and should be used before any other authority.
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">1. Constitutions, codes, statutes, and
ordinances are the written laws of either the United States, the
individual states, counties, and municipalities. These laws are
enacted by the United States Congress, state legislatures,
commissioners, and city councils. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">2. When a particular case is decided, it
becomes &quot;precedent&quot; which means that it becomes an
example or authority for an identical or similar case or a
similar question of law. Court decisions are the basis for the
system of stare decisis. These decisions are published in what is
called the National Reporter System which covers cases decided by
the United States Supreme Court down to the individual state
district courts. These reporters each have their own
&quot;digest&quot; system which serves as an index by subject on
points of law. There are many reporters in this system and they
can be found in most law libraries. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">- Secondary authority is used to obtain a broad
view of the area of law and also as a finding tool for primary
authority. Secondary authority is not cited to the court unless
there is no other authority available. </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">1. Legal encyclopedias contain topics which
    are arranged alphabetically and are substantiated by
    supporting authorities. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">2. Treatises are texts written about a
    certain topic of law by an expert in the field. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2">3. Law review articles are published by most
accredited law schools and are sometimes a broad diagnosis of a
particular area. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">4. The Index to Legal Periodicals provides the
only book reviews in the law and also provides case comments,
which cases are listed in the &quot;Table of Cases.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">5. American Law Reports Annotated (A.L.R.) is a
collection of cases on single narrow issues. You must be aware
that A.L.R. must be constantly updated. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">6. Restatements are publications compiled from
statutes and decisions which tell what the law is in a particular
field. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">7. Shepard's Citations is a large set of law
books which provide a means by which any reported case (cited
decision) may be checked to see when and how another court (the
citing decision) has cited the first decision. All cases must be
checked to make sure another court has not reversed or overruled
your cited decision. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Some basic rules of legal research are as
follows: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">1. Give priority to cases from your own
    jurisdiction. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">2. Search for the most recent ruling on a
    subject matter. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">3. Check the pocket part in the back of
    almost all law books. The pocket part is the most frequently
    used device for updating law books. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">4. Pay attention to dates on books, i.e.,
    copyright date and date of pocket parts. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">5. Be aware of &quot;2d&quot; and
    &quot;3d&quot; citations. They distinguish one series from
    another. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">6. All legal citations are written with the
    volume number first, an abbreviation of the title, and the
    page number, e.g., 152 P.2d 967 or 144 A.L.R. 422. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">7.</font><a href="terms-st.htm#Shepardizing"><font size="2"> Shepardizing</font></a><font size="2"> your citations can save a lot of embarrassment
    later on. </font></p>

meant to be a complete or comprehensive guide to the law library
