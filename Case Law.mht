<P>If such an action by the trial court in Seidel rendered the dismissal =

<STRONG>void</STRONG>, then an even stronger case can be made that the =
violation=20
of Article 1.13(c) in the instant case rendered the resulting conviction =

<STRONG>void</STRONG>. By Article 1.13(c), the Legislature has =
specifically=20
prohibited a trial court from accepting a defendant's waiver of a jury =
trial=20
until the court has appointed an attorney to represent him. Here, not =
only was=20
"[t]he trial judge's action ... not authorized by law ...," <EM>Seidel, =
39=20
S.W.2d at 225</EM>, the action was specifically prohibited by statute. =
Requiring=20
an objection at trial in these circumstances would lead to a Catch-22 =
situation:=20
a defendant must object to not having an attorney appointed to advise =
him as to=20
waiver of jury trial, without having been advised by an attorney that he =
was=20
entitled to such representation and advice. Given the absurdity of such =
a=20
situation, we chose in the past to characterize the resulting conviction =
as=20
"<STRONG>void</STRONG>" and allow the defendant to raise the issue in a =
habeas=20
corpus proceeding. Otherwise, defendants, such as appellant, are left =
without a=20
remedy even though there has been a clear violation of a mandatory =
statute.</P>
<P>Thus, in a long line of cases, most notably Heath and Seidel, we have =
held=20
that some defects, even though they are "just" statutory defects, are so =

egregious that they are cognizable on habeas corpus. <EM>See Heath, 817 =
S.W.2d=20
at 336; Seidel, 39 S.W.3d 221 at 225; Ex parte McIver, 586 S.W.2d 851=20
(Tex.Crim.App. 1979)</EM>. In Heath, we characterized these defects as =
rendering=20
the conviction "<STRONG>void</STRONG>." 817 S.W.2d at 336. However, we =
could=20
have properly characterized as "fundamental" errors those "unauthorized=20
sentences" and "statutory defects" which render a sentence=20
<STRONG>void</STRONG>. No matter what we choose to call these "errors," =
the=20
underlying purpose is the same: to balance a convicted person's interest =
in the=20
vindication of his legal rights and the State's interest in the finality =
of=20
convictions.</P>
<P>In Texas, a defendant has a statutory right to have counsel appointed =
before=20
he can waive his right to a jury trial. The Legislature has decided that =
the=20
right to a jury trial is so important that before a defendant can waive =
that=20
right, he should have the opportunity to consult with counsel. If a =
trial court=20
denies a defendant that right by refusing to appoint counsel, equity =
demands=20
that the balance be struck in favor of the defendant. Therefore, a =
defendant=20
should be allowed to contest, in a habeas corpus proceeding, a violation =
of=20
Article 1.13(c).</P>
<P>The court then concluded that, in the case before it, the trial court =
had=20
jurisdiction of the subject matter because it was a circuit court which =
has=20
jurisdiction of all felonies and that any objection King had to =
jurisdiction=20
over his person was waived by his personal appearance. (<EM>State v. =
King, 426=20

<P>Conviction of a nonexistent crime results in a <STRONG>void</STRONG> =
judgment=20
not subject to waiver. <EM>People v. McCarty 94 Ill. 2d 28, 37 =
(1983)</EM>.</P>
<P>A recent discussion of the Rule 60(b)(4) grounds for attack on a=20
<STRONG>void</STRONG> judgment may be found in <EM>Fisher v. Amaraneni, =
565 So.=20
2d 84 (Ala. 1990)</EM>. The judgment was set aside for lack of personal=20
jurisdiction based on improper service by publication. The court defined =
a=20
judgment as <STRONG>void</STRONG> "only if the court rendering it lacked =

jurisdiction of the subject matter or of the parties, or if it acted in =
a manner=20
inconsistent with due process." Id. at 86 (citing<EM>Wonder v. =
Southbound=20
Records, Inc., 364 So. 2d 1173 (Ala. 1978)</EM>). It should be noted =
here that a=20
Rule 60(b)(4) motion involves a different standard of review than the =
other Rule=20
60(b) subsections since the court held "[w]hen the grant or denial turns =
on the=20
validity of the judgment, discretion has no place for operation. If the =

L.Ed.2d=20
412 (1963) where the court vacated a judgment as <STRONG>void</STRONG> =

after entry. See also Marquette <EM>Corp. v. Priester, 234 F.Supp. 799=20
(E.D.S.C.1964)</EM> where the court expressly held that clause Rule =

carries no real time limit.</P>
<P>In a long and venerable line of cases, the Supreme Court has held =
that,=20
without proper jurisdiction, a court cannot proceed at all, but can only =
note=20
the jurisdictional defect and dismiss the suit. See, <EM>e.g., =

an <EM>ultra vires act. Pp. 8=9717.</EM></P>
<P><STRONG>Recent Decisions</STRONG></P>
<P>=85And there is no indication in the statute that! such relief cannot =
be=20

Under a statute precisely like our own in the Oregon court held, that, =
"a=20

reached the same result. (Sebree v. Sebree (1907) 30 Ky Law Rep. 709, 9 =

282.) On the other hand, the court in the case under consideration =
arrived at a=20
contrary result. However, the cases cited in support of this decision, =
with one=20
exception, do not come within the statutory jurisdiction conferred by =
the code,=20
because the applications for relief had not been made within six, months =
after=20
judgment, The only exception was in a case where the facts precluded any =

possibility of surprise, as all parties were present when the order in =

granting relief in excess of a stipulation, was rendered. (<EM>Dyerville =

jurisdiction over judgments, but has already shown, it has no authority =
to=20
correct judicial errors therein, and as the error in these cases came =
within=20
that category the court naturally could give the applicant no relief,=20
There&shy;fore, if the appellate court was basing its negative answer, =
to the=20
question above propounded, upon these cases it would seem that its =
conclusion=20
was unjustifiable.</P>
<P>The question then may be asked, what difference does it make whether =
this=20
relief be granted or not; the party has his remedy by motion for a new =
trial or=20
an appeal, If the judgment were vacated, in all probability, another =
trial would=20
be necessary to get a proper judgment. But suppose a mistake like this, =
in the=20
judgment, is not discovered until after sixty days from the entry =
thereof. The=20
time for moving for a new trial, or appealing would have expired. Then =
the only=20
remedy would be under section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as =
there the=20
injured party is given six months in which to ask for relief. So, =
although the=20
practical result of this case, at first glance may not seem to be harsh, =
still=20
there are situations where this decision would deprive a litigant of a =
