<P>From the June 2003 Idaho Observer: 
<HR>

<P><B>Are we flesh and blood or a legal fiction? 
<P>Part 2: Legal Fiction </B>
<P>
<P>A debate regarding the relevance of our names as spelled in ALL CAPITAL 
LETTERS on government documents has been ongoing for some time. Does the ALL 
CAPS name indicate a citizenship status not described in the Constitution, or 
does government use an ALL CAPS representation of our names merely as a matter 
of style? In Part 1 of this three-part article (The IO, May, 2003) we discovered 
that there is no grammatical rule or style manual anywhere on Earth explaining 
government use of ALL CAP names. This month we will continue exploring this 
controversial topic by discussing whether or not the ALL CAP name government 
uses for us infers our status as a “legal fiction.” 
<P>The authors of The Real Life Dictionary of the Law, Gerald and Kathleen Hill, 
describe the term legal fiction: 
<P>“Legal fiction. n. A presumption of fact assumed by a court for convenience, 
consistency or to achieve justice. There is an old adage: 'Fictions arise from 
the law, and not law from fictions.'” 
<P>From Oran's Dictionary of the Law, 1999, this definition of legal fiction is 
found: 
<P>“A legal fiction is an assumption that something that is (or may be) false or 
nonexistent is true or real. Legal fictions are assumed or invented to help do 
justice. For example, bringing a lawsuit to throw a nonexistent “John Doe” off 
your property used to be the only way to establish a clear right to the property 
when legal title was uncertain.” 
<P>Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law, 1996, states: 
<P>“legal fiction: something assumed in law to be fact irrespective of the truth 
or accuracy of that assumption.” 
<P>Is this the reason behind the use of full caps when writing a proper name? 
Are the U.S. and state governments deliberately using a legal fiction to 
“address” people? We say deliberate because their own official publications 
state that proper names are not to be written in full caps. 
<P>In the same respect, by identifying their own government entity in full caps, 
they are legally stating that they are also a legal fiction. 
<P><B>The assumption of a legal fiction </B>
<P>As stated by Dr. Mary Newton Bruder, the use of full caps for writing a 
proper name is an “internal style” for what is apparently an undefined usage. 
Whether a proper name written in full caps is a legal fiction and can be 
substituted for a proper name, is the issue. If so, from where does this legal 
fiction originate and what enforces it? 
<P>In all cases, a legal fiction is an assumption of purported fact without 
having shown the fact to be true or valid. It's an acceptance with no proof. 
Simply, to assume is to pretend. Oran's Dictionary of the Law says that the word 
assume means: 
<P>1. To take up or take responsibility for; to receive; to undertake. See 
assumption. 
<P>2. To pretend. 
<P>3. To accept without proof. 
<P>These same basic definitions are used by nearly all of the modern law 
dictionaries. There is a difference between the meanings of the second and third 
definitions with that of the first. Pretending and accepting without proof are 
similar, however, to take responsibility for and receive, or assumption, does 
not have the same meaning. 
<P>Oran's defines assumption as: “Formally transforming someone else's debt into 
your own debt. Compare with guaranty.” 
<P>Now, what happens if all the meanings for the word assume are combined? In a 
literal and definitive sense, the meaning of assume would be: The pretended 
acceptance, without proof, that someone has taken responsibility for, has 
guaranteed, or has received a debt. 
<P>Therefore, if we apply all this in defining a legal fiction, the use of a 
legal fiction is an assumption or pretension that the legal fiction named has 
received and is responsible for a debt of some sort. 
<P>Use of the legal fiction JOHN SMITH in place of the proper name John Smith 
implies an assumed debt guarantee without any offer of proof. The danger behind 
this is that if such an unproven assumption is made, it is considered valid. An 
assumed debt is valid unless proven otherwise. This is in accord with the 
Uniform Commercial Code made a part of the statutes in each state. A legal 
fiction written with full caps - resembling a proper name but grammatically not 
a proper name - is being held as a debtor for an assumed debt. 
<P>What happens if the proper name, i.e. John Smith, answers for or assumes the 
legal fiction, i.e. JOHN SMITH? They become one and the same. This is the crux 
of the full caps legal fictions used by the U.S. government and the states. It 
is the way that they can bring someone into their fictional venue and 
jurisdiction that they have created. Why won't they use “The State of Texas” or 
“John Smith” in their courts or on driver's licenses? What stops them from doing 
this? Obviously, there is a reason for using legal fictions since they are very 
capable of writing proper names just as their own official style manuals state. 
<P><B>American Jurisprudence </B>
<P>In general, it's necessary to properly identify parties to court actions. If 
not properly identified, then judgments are void, as outlined in Volume 46, 
American Jurisprudence 2d, at Judgments: 
<P>“§ 100 Parties - A judgment should identify the parties for and against whom 
it is rendered, with such certainty that it may be readily enforced, and a 
judgment which does not do so may be regarded as void for uncertainty. Such 
identification may be achieved by naming the persons for and against whom the 
judgment is rendered. Technical deficiencies in the naming of the persons for 
and against whom judgment is rendered can be corrected if the parties are not 
prejudiced. A reference in a judgment to a party plainly liable, followed by an 
omission of that party's name from the language of the decree, at least gives 
rise to an ambiguity and calling for an inquiry into the court's real intention 
as reflected in the entire record and surrounding circumstances.” 
<P><B>Federal Rules and Legal Fictions </B>
<P>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 9(a) Capacity, states: 
<P>“When an issue is raised as to the legal existence of a named party, or the 
party's capacity to be sued, or the authority of a party to be sued, the party 
desiring to raise the issue shall do so by specific negative averment, which 
shall include supporting particulars.” 
<P>It appears that the existence of a name written with full caps is a legal 
fiction. Use of the proper name must be insisted upon as a matter of abatement 
or correction. However, the current “courts” cannot correct this since they are 
based on fictional law and use fictional names. Instead, they expect the lawful 
man or woman to accept their full caps name and become a legal fiction, just as 
they are. 
<P><B>A Legal Person </B>
<P>One of the terms used predominantly by the present civil governments and 
courts in America is legal person. Just what is a legal person? 
<P>legal person: a body of persons or an entity (as a corporation) considered as 
having many of the rights and responsibilities of a natural person and esp. the 
capacity to sue and be sued. -- Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law 1996. 
<P>Person. 1. A human being (a “natural” person). 2. A corporation (an 
“artificial” person). Corporations are treated as persons in many legal 
situations. Also, the word “person” includes corporations in most definitions in 
this dictionary. 3. Any other “being” entitled to sue as a legal entity (a 
government, an association, a group of Trustees, etc.) -- Oran's Dictionary of 
the Law, West Group 1999. 
<P>Person. An entity with legal rights and existence including the ability to 
sue and be sued, to sign contracts, to receive gifts, to appear in court either 
by themselves or by lawyer and, generally, other powers incidental to the full 
expression of the entity in law. Many laws give certain powers to “persons” 
which, in almost all instances, includes business organizations that have been 
formally registered such as partnerships, corporations or associations. -- 
Duhaime's Law Dictionary. 
<P>PERSON, noun. per'sn. [Latin persona; said to be compounded of per, through 
or by, and sonus, sound; a Latin word signifying primarily a mask used by actors 
on the stage.] -- Webster's 1828 Dictionary. 
<P>A person is basically an entity; a legal fiction of some kind that has been 
legally created and has the legal capacity to be sued. Isn't it odd that the 
word lawful is not used within these definitions? 
<P><B>Legal or Lawful? </B>
<P>It's quite necessary to also define what is legal as opposed with what is 
lawful. Is there a difference in the meanings? 
<P>The following is quoted from A Dictionary of Law 1893: 
<P>Lawful. In accordance with the law of the land; according to the law; 
permitted, sanctioned, or justified by law. “Lawful” properly implies a thing 
conformable to or enjoined by law; “Legal”, a thing in the form or after the 
manner of law or binding by law. A writ or warrant issuing from any court, under 
color of law, is a “legal” process however defective. See legal. 
<P>Legal. Latin legalis. Pertaining to the understanding, the exposition, the 
administration, the science and the practice of law: as, the legal profession, 
legal advice. Implied or imputed in law. Opposed to actual. “Legal” looks more 
to the letter, and “Lawful” to the spirit, of the law. “Legal” is more 
appropriate for conformity to positive rules of law; “Lawful” for accord with 
ethical principle. “Legal” imports rather that the forms of law are observed, 
that the proceeding is correct in method, that rules prescribed have been 
obeyed; “Lawful” that the right is actful in substance, that moral quality is 
secured. “Legal” is the antithesis of “equitable”, and the equivalent of 
“constructive”. 2 Abbott's Law Dict. 24 
<P>Legal matters administrate, conform to, and follow rules and are implied 
rather than actual. A legal process can be defective in law. This falls in line 
with our previous discussions of legal fictions and the color of law. To be 
legal, a matter does not follow the law. Instead, it conforms to and follows the 
rules of law. This may help your understanding as to why the Federal and State 
Rules of Civil &amp; Criminal Procedure are cited in every court petition so as 
to conform to legal requirements of the legal fictions, i.e., the STATE OF 
GEORGIA or the U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, that rule the courts. 
<P>Lawful matters are ethically enjoined in the law of the land - the law of the 
people -- and are actual in nature, not implied. This is why the Constitution 
has little bearing or authority in the present day “legal” courts. Legalism has 
taken over the law. 
<P><B>How debt is assumed by legal fictions </B>
<P>Since an assumption, by definition, implies debt, what debt does a legal 
fiction assume? 
<P>The government use of full caps in place of proper names is absolutely no 
mistake. It signifies an internal “legal” rule and authority. Its foundation is 
legal fiction and the result is further legal fiction that is created, 
promulgated, instituted, administrated, and enforced via legal rule, code, 
statute and policy. Let's just call them 'the laws that are but never were.' 
<P>Qui sentit commodum, sentire debet et onus. He who enjoys the benefit, ought 
also to bear the burden. He who enjoys the advantage of a right takes the 
accompanying disadvantage -- a privilege is subject to its condition or 
conditions. -- Bouvier's Maxims of Law 1856. 
<P><B>The Birth Certificate </B>
<P>Since the early 1960s, state governments created legal fictions signified by 
full caps with birth certificates to “persons” bearing legal fiction full caps 
names. It may look as if it's your proper name, but that's impossible since no 
proper name is ever written in full caps. The birth certificate is the 
government's legal instrument for its legal title to the personal legal fiction 
they have created just for you. 
<P>When a child is born, the hospital sends the original, not a copy, of the 
record of live birth to the State Bureau of Vital Statistics, sometimes called 
the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS). Each STATE is 
required to supply the UNITED STATES with birth, death, and health statistics. 
The STATE agency that receives the original record of live birth keeps it and 
then issues a birth certificate in the name of the child's fictional person, as 
signified in full caps, i.e. JAMES SMITH. 
<P>cer*tif*i*cate, noun. 3: a document evidencing ownership or debt. -- Merriam 
Webster Dictionary 1998. 
<P>The birth certificate issued by the state is then registered with the U.S. 
Department of Commerce - the Executive Office - specifically through their own 
sub-agency, the U.S. Census Bureau, who is responsible to register vital 
statistics from all the states. The word registered, as it is used within 
commercial or legal based equity law, does not mean that the full caps name was 
merely noted in a book for reference purposes. When a birth certificate is 
registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce, it means that the legal person 
named on it in full caps has become a surety or guarantor. 
<P>Surety. The person who has pledged him or herself to pay back money or 
perform a certain action if the principal to a contract fails, as collateral, 
and as part of the original contract. -- Duhaime's Law Dictionary. 1: a formal 
engagement (as a pledge) given for the fulfillment of an undertaking. 2: one who 
promises to answer for the debt or default of another. Under the Uniform 
Commercial Code, however, a surety includes a guarantor, and the two terms are 
generally interchangeable. -- Merriam Webster's Dictionary of Law 1996. 
<P>Guarantor. A person who pledges collateral for the contract of another, but 
separately, as part of an independent contract with the obligee of the original 
contract. -- Duhaime's Law Dictionary. 
<P>It's not difficult to see that a state created birth certificate, written 
with full caps in the name of a legal person, is a document evidencing debt. 
This is how it works: Once each State has registered the birth certificates with 
the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of the Treasury - also a 
part of the Executive Office - then issues treasury securities in the form of 
treasury bonds, notes, and bills using the birth certificates as sureties or 
guarantors for these purported Securities. This is based on the future tax 
revenues of the legal person. This means that the bankrupt corporate U.S. can 
guarantee to the purchasers of their securities the lifetime labor and tax 
revenues of all Americans as collateral for payment. They simply do this by 
converting the lawful name into a legal person. 
<P>Legally, you are considered a slave or indentured servant to the various 
federal, state and local governments via your STATE issued and created birth 
certificate in the name of your full caps person. The reason this birth 
certificate was issued is so that they hold the title of birth to your legal 
person. 
<P>This is compounded further when one voluntarily obtains a driver's license or 
a Social Security Identification number. They own even your personal and private 
life through your STATE issued marriage certificate issued in the names of legal 
persons. You have no rights in birth, marriage, or even death. They hold the 
sovereign right to all legal fiction titles they have created under this “legal“ 
scheme. 
<P>Our current problem is that we have voluntarily agreed to their system of 
legal fiction by simply remaining silent - a legal default - and not taking 
claim to our own rights. The legal rules and codes enforce themselves. There is 
no court hearing to determine if those rules are correct. Their “law” is 
self-regulating and self-supporting. Once set into motion, their “laws” 
automatically come into effect provided the legal process has been followed. 
<P>Cujusque rei potissima pars principium est -- The principal part of 
everything is in the beginning. 
<P>*** 
<P>Next month: Part 3 will conclude this study of the relevance of government's 
ALL CAP name for us by discussing the legal foundations of citizenship as 
described in the Constitution and citizenship as it was altered upon 
ratification of the 14th Amendment.
