<p style="font-family: Calibri; margin-left: 40px;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The constitutional 
    rights of an individual are fundamental and inalienable rights. They cannot
    be destroyed nor diminished by legislative act, or failure to act. The
 duty  of seeing that they are protected and preserved inviolate falls squarely
   upon the shoulders of the judiciary. <br>

<p style="font-family: Calibri; margin-left: 40px;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the rights 
    involved in this case is the fundamental right of liberty, one which the
   trial court has lightly passed over in order to justify its decision. The
   decision of the trial court did not consider the constitution as a whole
  but rather focused on the legislative power. Those in government cannot
set  constitutional law at defiance by lightly passing over a citizen's right
 to liberty which the constitution guarantees. </p>

               
<p style="font-family: Calibri; margin-left: 40px;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right to personal 
    liberty is one of the most sacred and valuable rights of a citizen, and 
  should not be regarded lightly. <br>

<p style="font-family: Calibri; margin-left: 40px;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most important
    rights guaranteed under our Constitution, that of the liberty of the
citizen,     is involved and cannot be lightly passed over, nor can encroachments
upon     that right be tolerated even under the argument that, in the main,
the  general   result sought is a beneficent one. The law may not be set
at defiance,  even   to subserve the best-intentioned effort; much less by
officers who  have taken  an oath to uphold it. <br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Calibri;">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That this right of
    liberty which the Appellant possesses includes the right of locomotion
 or   travel is basic and obvious. The establishment and understanding of
this  right of liberty, as it applies to the Appellant, is of paramount importance
   in making a judicial determination in this case. The 'liberty' claimed
at   trial includes the 'right to travel.' </p>

               
<p style="font-family: Calibri; margin-left: 40px;">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Supreme Court

    The common law rule was that a public highway was a "way common and free

    Under the general law a public street is a public highway, and, if a highway,
    it is a "road which every citizen has a right to use." The right of the
  citizen to pass and repass on it is limited to no particular part of it
for,  as said in the books, "the public are entitled not only to a free passage
  along the highway, but to a free passage along any portion of it not in
the  actual use of some other traveler." 1 Hawk. P.C. 22; Ang. &amp; D. Highways,

    There can be no denial of the general proposition that every citizen of
  the United States, and every citizen of each State of the Union, as an
attribute    of personal liberty, has the right ordinarily, of free transit 
from, or  through  the territory of any State. This freedom of egress or ingress
is  guaranteed  to all by the clearest implications of the Federal, as well
as  of the State  constitution. It has been said that even in England, whence
 our system of  jurisprudence was derived, the right to personal liberty
 did  not depend on  any express statute, but "it was the birthright of every
 freeman."-Cooley's    Const. Lim. 342. This right was said by Sir William
 Blackstone to consist    in "the power of locomotion, of changing situation,
 or of moving one's person   to whatsoever place one's inclination may direct,
 without imprisonment or   restraint, unless by due process of law."

    That the lower court and Respondent should ignore and trample over the 
 meaning  and original intent of our State Constitution and recognize only 
 current statutes, is not only being legally nearsighted but is a gross violation
   of their oath of office.&nbsp; As a result the trial court gravely erred
  in its decision.&nbsp; The liberty to travel and to move from place to
place,    which existed under the common law, and which existed in colonial
America,    also exists under the State Constitutions.&nbsp; The "liberty"
in the Constitution    secures the same rights it included at common law
and means the same thing-a    right to travel:Freedom of locomotion, although
subject to proper restrictions,     is included in the 'liberty' guaranteed
by State Constitution. <br>

    The law does not denounce motor carriages, as such, on the public ways. 
  * * * they have an equal right with other vehicles in common use to occupy 
  the streets and roads. * * * It is improper to say that the driver of the 
  horse has rights in the road superior to the driver of the automobile.&nbsp; 
  Both have the right to use the easement. <br>

    "'The right of a citizen to travel upon the highway and transport his 
property    thereon in the ordinary course of life and business differs radically 
an   obviously from that of one who makes the highway his place of business 
and   uses it for private gain, in the running of a stage coach or omnibus.&nbsp; 
   The former is the usual and ordinary right of a citizen, a right common 
 to  all; while the latter is special, unusual and extraordinary.&nbsp; As 
 to the former, the extent of legislative power is that of regulation; but 
 as to the latter its power is broader; the right may be wholly denied, or 
 it may be permitted to some and denied to others, because of its extraordinary 
  nature.&nbsp; This distinction, elementary and fundamental in character, 
 is recognized by all the authorities.' </p>

               
<p style="font-family: Calibri; margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;"The argument is that the privilege of
    using the public highways as a place for the transaction of private business
    is not a vested right but a privilege which the state may grant or withhold
    at its pleasure; that having the right to withhold such privilege it
may    grant the same upon such terms and conditions as it may see fit to
impose;    that it may say in effect to the applicant for such privilege,
'I will grant   you the privilege of using the public highways for private
gain in the transaction    of your business upon the condition that you in
turn shall  dedicate the  property  used by you in such business to the public
use of  public transportation.'&nbsp;    There is much force in this contention.
 </p>

               
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;"It has been repeatedly decided that the
    right of a common carrier to use the public highways for the conduct
of   his  business as such is not a vested or natural right, but is a mere
privilege     or license which the legislature may grant or withhold in its
discretion,     or which it may grant upon such conditions as it may see
fit to impose.&nbsp;     [Citations omitted.]&nbsp; The supreme court of
Washington said in Hadfield     v. Lundin, [98 Wash. 657, Ann. Cas. 1918C,
942, L. R. A. 1918B, 909, 168    Pac. 516]: 'If any proposition may be said
to be established by authority,    the right of the state in the exercise
of its police power to prohibit the   use of the streets as a place of private
business, or as the chief instrumentality    in conducting such business,
must be held so established.&nbsp; Nor can  it  be questioned that the power
to prohibit includes the power to regulate  even  to the extent that the
regulation under given conditions may be tantamount    to a prohibition.&nbsp;
Where the power to prohibit exists, the reasonableness    of any regulation
is palpably a legislative question, pure and simple.'  ...  Upon principle,
however, we perceive no reason why the rule should not  apply  with equal
force to the case of a private carrier who proposes to use the  street as
a place of private business or as the chief instrumentality  thereof.&nbsp;
 The rule ... rests equally upon the circumstance that he is using the public
 highways as the chief instrumentality of a private business  conducted for
 private gain.&nbsp; In other words, he is enjoying a special  privilege
in  the highways which are constructed and maintained at public  expense
and designed  for the common use of all. ... We are of the opinion  that
the state has the  right in the granting of such special privileges in its
public highways to require that the recipient thereof in consideration  therefor
return a reasonable quid pro quo to the public ..." <br><b><i>Frost v. Railroad Commission </i>(1925)

    and limitations upon private carriers when using the public highways for
   the transaction of their business] with respect to common carriers using
  the public highways for the transaction of their business in the transportation
    of persons or property for hire.&nbsp; That rule is stated as follows
by   the supreme court of the United States: 'A citizen may have, under the
fourteenth   amendment, the right to travel and transport his property upon
them (the  public highways) by auto vehicle, but he has no right to make
the highways  his place of business by using them as a common carrier for
hire.&nbsp; Such  use is a privilege which may be granted or withheld by
the state in its discretion,   without violating either the due process clause
or the equal protection clause.'&nbsp;  (Buck v. Kuykendall, 267 U. S. 307
[38 A. L. R. 286, 69 L. Ed. 623, 45 Sup.  Ct. Rep. 324].)&nbsp; (Italics added.)&nbsp;
Petitioners emphasize the words  which we have italicized and insist that
this rule is limited in its application  to common carriers.&nbsp; We think
it is equally applicable to all persons  who seek to make a special and private
use of the public highways by transacting  their private business thereon
and that it applies with equal force to private  carriers who engage in the
business of transportation for hire upon the public  highways." <br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Calibri;">72.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "... One who transports merely
his own freight over the highway is not a carrier, private or otherwise.&nbsp; 
    He may be a farmer or a manufacturer or a merchant or what not, but the 
  business in which he is engaged is not the business of transportation.&nbsp; 
  He is not a carrier unless he engages in the business of transportation 
of&nbsp;   the persons or property of others for compensation.&nbsp; One who
transports   merely his own goods is of necessity engaged in some business 
other than  transportation and the transportation of such goods is no more 
than an incident  to such business." <br>

    to impose a license tax upon those engaged in the business of operating 
  motor vehicles upon the public highways for the transportation of persons 
  or property for compensation.&nbsp; Section 1 defines certain words and 
phrases  employed in the act.&nbsp; The term 'operator' is declared generally 
to include  all persons, firms, associations, and corporations who operate 
motor vehicles   upon any public highway in the state and thereby engage in
the transportation   of persons or property for hire or compensation.&nbsp; 
The term 'motor vehicles'   is defined to mean and include all vehicles, automobiles,
trucks, or trailers   operated upon or over the public highways of this state
whether the same  be propelled or operated by steam or electricity or propelled
or operated  by combustion of gasoline, distillate, or other volatile and
inflammable liquid fuels. ... </p>

               
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;"Section 2 of the act provides: 'Each operator of a motor vehicle 
    within this state who transports or desires to transport for compensation 
    or hire persons or property upon or over any public highway within this 
  state shall apply to and secure from the board of equalization of the State 
  of California a license to operate each and all of the motor vehicles which 
  such operator desires to operate or which such operator from time to time 
  may operate.' ... </p>

               
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;It is provided in Section 7 that any operator using the public highways
    of the state for the transportation of persons or property for hire,
either     as a public or private carrier without first obtaining the license
...  is   guilty of a misdemeanor ..." <br>

  vehicles  over the public highways for hire, ... On November 2, 1926, the
  People adopted  an amendment to article XIII, section 15, of the Constitution,
  changing the  tax rate ... on carriage of passengers and ... on transportation
  of property,  and relieving the carrier of municipal licenses and taxes.&nbsp;
   ... The amendment contained the provision that 'Such taxes shall be in
lieu   of all other taxes and licenses' upon the property of such companies."
