        <UL>
          <P>If the party can convince the court the error in the judgment was 
          clerical, and not substantive, the district court is not limited to 
          one year to amend the judgment. (See "Motion to Correct Clerical Error

        <UL>"(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered 
          Evidence; Fraud, Etc. On motion and upon such terms as are just, the 
          court may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a 
          final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: 
          <BR>(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; <BR>(2) 
          newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been 
          discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); <BR>(3) 
          fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), 
          misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; <BR>(4) 
          the judgment is void; <BR>(5) the judgment has been satisfied, 
          released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based 
          has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitahle 
          that the judgment should have prospective application; or <BR>(6) any 
          other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. 
          <P>The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons 
          (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or 
          proceeding was entered or taken. A motion under this subdivision (b) 
          does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation.

      Yonkers Racing Corp., 48 F.3d 1320, 1325 (2d Cir.1995). (If the error is 
      substantive, a party may challenge an error in the judgment by filing an 
      "independent action" for relief from judgment. FRCP 60(b) does not limit 
      the power of a court to entertain an independent action.)

      (5th Cir.1984) (The standard for obtaining relief in an independent action 
      is even more stringent than the standard for obtaining relief under FRCP 
      60(b). To maintain an independent action for relief from judgment, the 
      movant must show that (1) a judgment was entered which ought not, in 
      equity and good conscience, be enforced; (2) the movant has a good defense 
      to the cause of action on which the judgment is founded; (3) the movant 
      was prevented by fraud, accident, or mistake from obtaining the benefit of 
      its defense; (4) the movant was not at fault or negligent; and (5) the 
      movant has no adequate remedy at law.)

      (FRCP "60(b) provides that a judgment may be set aside for fraud upon the 
      court. One species of fraud upon the court occurs when an 'officer of the 
      court' perpetrates fraud affecting the ability of the court or jury to 
      impartially judge a case. At 1132-33: '[T] he inquiry as to whether a 
      judgment should be set aside for fraud upon the court under Rule 60(b) 
      focuses [on] whether the alleged fraud harms the integrity of the judicial 
      process."')

      60(b) "enables a court to grant relief from a judgment under the 
      particular circumstances listed in the text of the rule.... Rule 60(b) ... 
      was designed to address mistakes attributable to special circumstances and 
      not merely to erroneous applications of law. [Paragraph] Rule 60(b) ... is 
      not an appropriate vehicle for addressing simple legal error, otherwise a 
      party could circumvent the ordinary time limitation for filing a notice of 
      appeal.")
