<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general misconception is that any statute passed
 by legislators bearing the appearance of law constitutes the law of the land. 
The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and any statute, to be 
valid, must be In agreement.  It is impossible for both the Constitution and a 
law violating it to be valid; one must prevail. This is succinctly stated as 
follows:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General rule is that an unconstitutional statute, 
though having the form and name of law is in reality no law, but is wholly void, 
and ineffective for any purpose; since unconstitutionality dates from the time 
of it's enactment and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it. 
An unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation, is as inoperative as if it had 
never been passed. Such a statute leaves the question that it purports to settle 
just as it would be had the statute not been enacted.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since an unconstitutional law is void, the general 
principles follow that it imposes no duties, confers no rights, creates no
 office, bestows no power or authority on anyone, affords no protection, and 
justifies no acts performed under it.....</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A void act cannot be legally consistent with a valid 
one. An unconstitutional law cannot operate to supersede any existing valid law. 
Indeed, insofar as a statute runs counter to the fundamental law of the lend, it 
is superseded thereby.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one Is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and 
no courts are bound to enforce it.</P>
<P><FONT size="+1">Jon Roland:</FONT></P>
<P>Strictly speaking, an unconstitutional statute is not a "law", and should not 
be called  a "law", even if it is sustained by a court, for a finding that a 
statute or other official  act is constitutional does not make it so, or confer 
any authority to anyone to enforce it.</P>
<P>All citizens and legal residents of the United States, by their presence on 
the  territory of the United States, are subject to the militia duty, the duty 
of the  social compact that creates the society, which requires that each, alone 
and in  concert with others, not only obey the Constitution and constitutional 
official acts,  but help enforce them, if necessary, at the risk of one's 
life.</P>
<P>Any unconstitutional act of an official will at least be a violation of the 
oath  of that official to execute the duties of his office, and therefore 
grounds for his  removal from office. No official immunity or privileges of rank 
or position survive  the commission of unlawful acts. If it violates the rights 
of individuals, it is also likely to  be a crime, and the militia duty obligates 
anyone aware of such a violation to  investigate it, gather evidence for a 
prosecution, make an arrest, and if necessary,  seek an indictment from a grand 
jury, and if one is obtained, prosecute the offender  in a court of law.</P>
