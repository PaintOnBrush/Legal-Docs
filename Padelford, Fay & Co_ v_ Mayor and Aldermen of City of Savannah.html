            <BLOCKQUOTE>"No private person has a right to complain by suit in 
              court on the ground of a breach of the United States constitution;

            <P>[5.] The Constitution is to be construed in the sense in which it 
            was understood by the makers of it at the time when they made 
it.</P>
            <P>[6.] This sense is expressed by the four following

            <OL>
              <LI>
              <LI>That the Constitution delegated to the General Government, or

              delegated such powers as it expressly enumerated.</LI>
              <LI>That it delegated no exclusive power, unless the delegation 
              was said to be exclusive.</LI>

              <LI>That the words used in it, if susceptible of more meanings 
              than one, were used in the meaning which was least favorable to

            <H2>Discussion</H2>
            <H3>As received from Lewis Mohr:</H3>
            <P>This is a very interesting case for 2 reasons:<BR>
            <P>1, a man is not a party to the constitutions, and<BR>
            <P>2, the supreme court of Georgia is equal to the US Supreme 
            Court.</P>
            <P>This is real cool news to those who would collect taxes by 
            claiming that the 16th amendment gives them the authority to collect 
            a tax. From who? The constitutions do not apply to a private person. 
             Therefore subdivisions of things created by constitutions do not 
            apply to a private person.  I suppose the mantra for everyone who 
            receives a presentment should be "Show me the contract."  Also, 
            could the commercial agents of this state claim that the Supreme 
            Court of Texas is co-equal to the US Supreme Court, or due to the 
            1854 year of the Padelford case being prior to the Civil War a state 
            can no longer assert such a claim due to the fact that we no longer 
            even have a functioning de jure constitution.  This Padelford case 
            make 2 very poignant revelations that should cause all to demand 
            full disclosure for where does all of the federal agencies get their 
            authority for coming into the states and dictating their policy.  
            Hhmm... Have all of the state governors surrendered the sovereignty 
            of the states to a commercial foreign power?</P>

            <H3>As received from Larry Becraft:</H3>
            <P>Lewis,</P>
            <P>I do not place much credence in that isolated statement. Judges 
            write opinions for the purpose of explaining how they reached 
            certain results and conclusions. If a decision by a Supreme Court, 
            it applies in that jurisdiction. It has no effect in other 
            jurisdictions. But then again over time, an opinion containing 
            “dicta” may not be upheld in the future. That statement about "not 
            being a party to the constitution" conflicts with other authority. 
            Let me explain.</P>
            <P>That statement needs to be examined in the appropriate context. 
            The Georgia Supreme Court that rendered that decision in 1854 was 
            created by the Georgia Constitution of 1798, which is posted 
            here:<BR><A href="http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/con1798.htm" 
            target="_blank">GEORGIA CONSTITUTION OF 1798</A></P>
            <P>That 1798 constitution was not adopted by the people, but by a 
            committee of authorized delegates:<BR>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>"We the underwritten delegates of the people of the 
              State of Georgia, chosen and authorized by them to revise, alter 
              or amend the powers and principles of their government, do 
              declare, ordain, and ratify the several articles and sections 
              contained in the six pages hereunto prefixed, as the constitution 
              of this State; and the same shall be in operation from the date 
              hereof."</BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P></P>
            <P>Thus as a matter of fact, the people and citizens of Georgia had 
            nothing to do with adoption of that 1798 constitution, which was in 
            effect when the Padelford decision was rendered. But the later 
            Georgia Constitutions were adopted via approval of the citizens.</P>
            <P>That statement that people/persons/citizens were not parties to 
            that constitution is thus correct. However, most constitutions 
            adopted over the last 150 years have been adopted by popular vote of 
            the people. In this respect, I would say that those voting for a 
            constitution are “parties” to it.</P>
            <P>Here in Alabama, our present constitution was adopted in 1901. It 
            constitutes a charter creating a state government and, typical of 
            American constitutions, it created 3 branches. Constitutions create 
            governmental institutions. The Alabama legislature was granted 
            law-making power via our 1901 constitution. As a citizen of Alabama, 
            I guess I could consider myself a “party” to that Constitution in 
            the sense that I, a later citizen of Alabama, am the posterity of 
            those previous citizens. But in reality, I was not even born in 
            1901, and thus clearly was not a "party".</P>
            <P>But all this “patriot” chit-chat about being a party to the 
            constitution is really irrelevant. Under Alabama law, I can complain 
            when government violates the constitution, and I have done so many 
            times, including just a couple of weeks ago when I drafted a motion 
            to suppress for a friend of mine who needed one quick. Motions to 
            suppress challenge a search with an argument that such search 
            violated the Constitution. The same right to complain about 
            constitutional violations exists at the federal level as well as all 
            other States in this country. Consequently, based on legal authority 
            I am not going to catalog here, the statement in the Padelford case 
            is irrelevant.</P>
