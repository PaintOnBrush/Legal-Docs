<P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
Any bill, rule, regulation, code, or other document that purports to be a Law<BR>
must contain an &quot;Enacting Clause.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
Enacting Clauses are required by the Constitutions of 46 of the 50 States, 
and the Supreme Courts of the other 4 States have all ruled that Enacting Clauses are required, 
even though the Constitution doesn't require them.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
The Constitution for the United States does not require Enacting Clauses, 
even though the Preamble to the Constitution is the Enacting Clause for the Constitution.</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="divid005.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="5"></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Enacting Clauses identify the Individual, or the group, that created the Law.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
This information will allow everyone to determine their legal or lawful relationship is to the Individual, 
or group, that is created the Law.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
If there is no legal or lawful relationship, then the law does not apply.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
If you live in Florida, you are not subject to the laws of California unless you happen to be visiting California</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
Enacting Clauses also declare the authority the Individual, or group, claims in order to create the Law.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
If the Individual, or group, has no authority, or right, to create the law, 
then the law is not really a law and has no effect on anyone.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
As an example:<BR>
The Janitor in the Senate Office Building has no authority to write a law, even though he works in the Senate Office Building.</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="PosterBodoni BT">
Enacting Clauses have been used throughout history</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
The Ten Commandments has an Enacting Clause:</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>
The Clause states:<FONT COLOR="Green">&quot;I am the Lord thy God&quot;</FONT></B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
The Individual is the &quot;Lord&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>
His authority is that He is our God</B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="divid005.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="5"></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
The edict of Cyrus to allow the Jews to rebuild Jerusalem has an Enacting Clause:</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>
The Clause states:<FONT COLOR="Green">&quot;Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia&quot;</FONT></B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>
The Individual is &quot;Cyrus&quot;</B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>
His authority is that He is the King</B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="divid005.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="5"></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial">
The Constitution for the united States or America has an Enacting Clause:</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>
The Clause, which is in the Preamble to the Constitution, states:<FONT COLOR="Green">&quot;We the People&quot;</FONT></B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT COLOR="Black" SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
The goup is &quot;We&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>
Our authority is that we are the People and Sovereign People are the source of all legitimate Laws.</B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="divid005.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="5"></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
Almost all constitutions prescribe the mode and process of making laws.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
Generally, these include:
</FONT></B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Giving the bill a Title that is reflective of the purpose set forth in the bill</FONT></B></LI>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
Placing the Enacting Clause between the Title and the Body of the Bill</FONT></B></LI>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
Reading the FULL bill on each of three different days in each Legislative House, 
including the Title and the Enacting Clause</FONT></B></LI>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
If Passed, the bill must be signed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and by the President of the Senate</FONT></B></LI>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
The votes must be recorded in the Journal for the specific House</FONT></B></LI>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
The bill must be signed by the governor of the State, or the president of the United States, as the case may be</FONT></B></LI>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
The completed bill must be recorded in the office of the Secretary of State</FONT></B></LI>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
The completed bill must be announced, by publication, by the Secretary of State</FONT></B></LI>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
And, it is extremely important that every publication of the Law must contain the Title, the Enacting Clause, and the full Body of the Law.</FONT></B></LI>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
If the publication does not contain everything, then there is no evidence on the face of the Law 
to prove that it was lawfully established, who created the Law, 
and what authority they claim to be entitled to create the Law.</FONT></B></LI>
</UL>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">If the publication does not contain these items, then the Law has not been properly published, as required,<BR>
therefore, the Law is null and void and has no effect on anyone.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial" COLOR="Green">Written Laws, in all times and all countries, whether the edicts of absolute monarchs, decrees of Kings and Councils, 
or the enactments of representative bodies, have almost invariably, in some form, 
expressed upon their face the authority by which they were promulgated or enacted. 
The almost unbroken custom of centuries has been to preface laws with a statement declaring the enacting authority. - Sjoberg v Security Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 73 Minn. 203,212,213, (1898) 
- State v Kozer, 239 pac. 805, 807, (Ore. 1925) 
- Joiner v State, 155 S.E.2d 8, 9, 223 GA 367 (1967) 
- 25 Ruling Case Law, &quot;Statutes,&quot; 22, p 775, 776 
- City of Carlyle v Nicolay, 165 N.E. 211, 216, 217 (Ill. 1929)</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The completed bill may also be subject to other procedures as 
are validly prescribed in the Constitution, or in the bill itself</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Then, and only then, can the bill be called a Law</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Then, and only then, can the Law be enforced</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="PosterBodoni BT">
But, there is still a very basic decision that must be addressed</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="center"> <FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial"><B>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>Who is subject to the Law?</B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="divid005.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="5"></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"><B>
Only those individuals who have a legal, or lawful, relationship to the Law makers are subject to any Law they create.</B></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
A Citizen of France is not subject to the Laws of the United States, or of China, or of any other country around the world, unless he, or she, is living, or traveling in that country.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
A Citizen of the State of New York is not subject to the Laws of Utah, or of California, or of any other State, unless he, or she, is living, or traveling in that State.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">
An individual living in a community is not subject to the Laws of the neighboring community, or of any other community, unless he, or she, is living, or traveling in that community.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Unless there is  a legal, or lawful, relationship to the Law makers, Individuals are not subject to the Laws created by such law makers</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial">That's why an Enacting Clause is required on any Law for it to be effective.</FONT></B></P>
