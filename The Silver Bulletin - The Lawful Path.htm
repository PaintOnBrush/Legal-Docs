      <H3>PART 1</H3></CENTER><STRONG>STATUS</STRONG>
      <P>"The status of an individual used as a legal term, means the legal 
      position of the individual in or with regard to the rest of the community. 
      L. R. 4 P.D. 11. The rights, duties, capacities and incapacitates which 
      determine a person to a given class, constitutes his status; Campb. Austin 
      137. ... ... The action of assumpsit must be reckoned a technical 
      instrument which gave no small help to the forces which were making for 
      the transition from status to contract; 3 Holdsw. Hist. E. L. 349." 
      Bouvier's Volume 3, page 3129.
      <P><STRONG>MAJOR PREMISE
      <P></STRONG>NATURE'S GOD Created Mankind, Mankind created Constitutions, 
      Constitutions created governments created Rules, Codes, Regulations, 
      and/or Statutes (hereinafter called Enactments), most of which are 
      nefariously Executed and Applied as some government -sponsored Court - 
      Crime -Revenue Raising-Activity.
      <P>The presumption that the THE PEOPLE are subject to government 
      Jurisdiction by way of government Enactments, presumes that THE PEOPLE are 
      subject to those Jurisdictions created by the Constitutions, which in-turn 
      created Such governments in a self-perpetuating fashion.
      <P>The Colonists' intent not to create a SOVEREIGN but rather, to further 
      bind the Branches of government is made clear in the Preamble To The Bill 
      Of Rights-December 15, 1791.
      <P>"The conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their 
      adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, IN ORDER TO PREVENT 
      MISCONSTRUCTION OR ABUSE OF ITS POWERS, THAT FURTHER DECLARATORY AND 
      RESTRICTIVE CLAUSES SHOULD BE ADDED: And as extending the Government, will 
      best insure the beneficent ends of its institution."
      <P>The Unlawful presumption that the Colonists intended to establish a 
      SOVEREIGN, by Their Constitutional Charter, thereafter conferring upon 
      Such SOVEREIGN certain Jurisdiction over the Colonists Themselves, is 
      properly debunked by: Article I., Section 9, Clause 8
      <P>"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: --" and 
      Article I., Section 10, Clause 1
      <P>"No State shall ... grant any Title of Nobility."
      <P>Any Jurisdiction emanating from a presumption of a fiction is 
      presumptive or fictitious, and Such is a Factitious Tool For Unlawful 
      Control.
      <P>Government sovranty over THE PEOPLE is a presumption and a fiction, and 
      which when once repudiated, must thereafter be proved to exist.
      <P>If the Individual cannot be Proved to be subject to the Jurisdiction of 
      any Constitution or Other Social Contract or Compact, He also cannot be 
      proved to be subject to the Jurisdiction of any Branch of government 
      Created Thereunder.
      <P>Likewise, if it cannot be Proved that The Individual is DIRECTLY 
      Subject to the Jurisdiction of any Legislature, it also cannot be Proved 
      that He is INDIRECTLY Subject to Such Jurisdiction by way of any 
      Legislative Enactments.
      <P>In the absence of proof that The Individual is subject to the 
      Jurisdiction of any Constitution or other Social Contract or Compact, 
      Jurisdiction over Him DOS NOT EXIST. 
      <P><STRONG>ARGUMENT - SUMMARY
      <P></STRONG>The general requirement that "... the burden is on the 
      defendant to show the nonexistence of Jurisdictional facts; Russell v. 
      Butler, (Tex.civ App.) 47 S.W.406; Gilchrist v. Oil Land Co., 21 W.Va.115, 
      45 Am.Rep.555.", (Bouvier's Volume 2, Page 1763), is resolved by Article 
      VI which defines exactly Who is subject to the Jurisdiction of the 
      Constitution, and exactly Who shall be Contractually Bound by Oath or 
      Affirmation to support Such Constitution in Consideration for Offices Of 
      Public Trust and those Benefits of Public Service and Public Employment. 
      "... The Senators and Representative before mentioned, and the members of 
      the several State Legislatures, and all executives and judicial Officers, 
      both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by 
      Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; ..." Article VI
      <P>Since the intent of Article VI is to define exactly to Whom the 
      Constitutional Jurisdiction applies; since the fact exists that THE PEOPLE 
      are excluded from the requirements of Article VI, prima facie; See: 
      INCLUSIO UNIS EST EXCLUSIO ALTERIUS: Black's, Page 687; 
      <P>since no presumption that THE PEOPLE are subject to the Jurisdiction of 
      the Constitution is, or can be made; since all Constitutions are 
      considered in pari materia with all other Constitutions;
      <P>since all Constitutions are subject to the provisions of Article VI; 
      since no Constitution operates on THE PEOPLE at-large by virtue of the 
      fact that THE PEOPLE are excluded from the requirements of Article VI, et 
      sqq; then in pursuing His occupations of Common-Right, the Individual has 
      made no Oath or Affirmation supporting any Constitution, and He is not 
      subject to any Constitutional Jurisdictions. 
      <P><STRONG>CONCLUSION - SUMMARY
      <P></STRONG>If The Individual is not subject to any Constitutional 
      Jurisdictions, He is also not subject to any Enactment made by any 
      Constitutionally Created Legislature;
      <P>if He is not subject to any Constitutional Jurisdictions, He is also 
      not subject to any Jurisdiction presumed by any Constitutionally Created 
      Executive Branch of Government; and
      <P>if He is not subject to any Constitutional Jurisdictions, He is also 
      not subject to any Jurisdiction presumed by any Constitutionally Created 
      Judiciary.
      <P>In the complete absence of any Lawful and verified Oath or Affirmation 
      made by a Nonparticipant Individual, to support any Constitution; or in 
      the complete absence of proving a Higher Title to that Property Known and 
      Described as the Nonparticipant Individual Himself, In Personam 
      Jurisdiction does not exist; and
      <P>in the complete absence of proving a Lawful and voluntary contract made 
      by Such Nonparticipant, pledging Himself and/or His Property- Rights to 
      certain specified performance, Subject Matter Jurisdiction does not exist; 
      and
      <P>in the complete absence of any Lawful and verified complaint made 
      against Such Nonparticipant, wherein a Real Injured Party Claims a Damage, 
      no criminal Jurisdictions exist; thus
      <P>in the complete absence of proving the existence of either In Personam 
      and or Subject Matter Jurisdiction, governmental Jurisdiction over the 
      Nonparticipant Individual does not exist. QUOD ERAT DEMONSTRANDUM. 
      <P><STRONG>TORT REMEDY
      <P></STRONG>Every Act perpetrated by any Constitutional Created Branch of 
      government while absent Jurisdiction; every Such Act being required to be 
      made unlawfully under Forces of Arms; and every Such act having been made 
      without probable cause; then, every Such Act is required to have been made 
      as a Trespass, and/or other Tort upon a Nonparticipant Individual, and 
      shall constitute a Case to be pursued against the Perpetrator in an Action 
      At Law for the recovery of Damages. 
      <P>
      <CENTER>
      <H3>PART 2</H3></CENTER>To better understand the Jurisdictional Argument, 
      We are first presenting a thumb-nail sketch of: 
      <P><STRONG>HISTORY
      <P></STRONG>The Revolutionary War was principally financed by "Old-World" 
      International Banking Interests (hereinafter called Federalists), Who had 
      made Substantial Investments into the Colonies for the purposes of making 
      Profits and Gains through Their Imports into, and their Exports from the 
      Colonies, where All Such Trade was conducted in International Commerce 
      under the Laws of Nations (in the Admiralty Jurisdiction).
      <P>Having been the Powers behind the Thrones and Churches throughout most 
      of "Civilized" History, The Federalists Conspired to establish a Strong 
      Central "Sovereign" Jurisdiction in the New Colonies to facilitate Their 
      Control over the Colonists themselves as Feudal Lords of Their Private 
      Lands.
      <P>Yielding to those Economic Pressures to establish an Area in which 
      International Commerce could be conducted pursuant to the Laws of Nations 
      (Admiralty), the Colonists established a Ten Mile Square (approximately., 
      3.2 miles x 3.2 miles) ADMIRALTY ZONE to be the Seat of the Admiralty 
      Government of the United States.
      <P><STRONG>SEDITION BY SYNTAX ("United States" DOES NOT mean "United 
      States of America" or "the Several States")</STRONG>
      <P>The aforesaid Admiralty Zone, now called Washington, D.C., is analogous 
      to the Thirteen Block Section known as "London Town" which was established 
      approximately 1066 A.D., under William the Conqueror, which IS NOT part of 
      Great Britain proper, and which operates principally in the Admiralty 
      Jurisdiction.
      <P>Just as "London Town" IS NOT part of Great Britain proper, Washington, 
      D.C., IS NOT part of the several United States of America, and Washington, 
      D.C., was created by Cession of particular States, and by the acceptance 
      of Congress, to become the Seat of the Government of the United States. 
      See Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution and the "United 
      States" as defined in Title 18 U.S.C. Section 5, "Title" 26 U.S.C. Section 
      3121(e)(2), and Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1603(c).
      <P>In 1790 the PUBLIC DEBT was 75 Millions of Dollars-by-Weight of Gold or 
      Silver, and on or about 1790, the First National Bank was given a Twenty 
      (20) Year Charter.
      <P>By 1792, "worthless as a continental" was commonly used to describe 
      those bitter Private Loss-Experiences connected the "The Continental 
      <PAPER>Dollar", issued by the United States in Its Federal Admiralty 
      Jurisdiction under the General Auspices and Control of the Said 
      Federalists.
      <P>This technique enable the Federalists to draw-off THE PEOPLES' Wealth 
      replacing it with PAPER.
      <P>On April 2, 1792, the Congress (of the several States) passed The 
      Coinage Act of 1792, Such Act exactly compelling the United States to 
      Perform in accordance with Article I, Section 8, Clause 5 of the 
      Constitution, by Prohibiting the United States from issuing PAPER Currency 
      at any time in the future.
      <P>In or about 1810, the Congress refused to renew the Federalists' 
      National Banking Charter.
      <P>In or about 1812, the Federalists declared War on the United States.
      <P>In or about 1815, the Second National Bank was given a twenty (20) year 
      Charter.
      <P>In 1815, the court in the case of De Lovio v. Boit, 7 Fed. Cases Number 
      3, 776 stated that:
      <P>"A policy of Insurance is a maritime contract, and therefore of 
      Admiralty Jurisdiction."
      <P>In 1835, the Public Debt was 38 thousands of Dollars-by-weight of Gold 
      or Silver, THE LOWEST EVER.
      <P>In 1836, President Andrew Jackson forced the closing of the Second 
      <NATIONAL>Bank of the U.S. by revoking Its Charter. He is said to have 
      been met by the Money Changers Who approached Him in the Drawing Room of 
      the White House, whereupon The President is said to have stated:
      <P>"Gentlemen, I have had men watching you for a long time and I am 
      convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the 
      breadstuffs of the country. When you won, you divided the profits amongst 
      you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me that if I 
      take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter, I shall ruin ten 
      thousand families. That may be true, gentlemen, but that is your sin! 
      Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families, and that 
      would be my sin! You are a den of vipers and thieves. I have determined to 
      rout you out, and by the Eternal God, I will rout you out!"
      <P>At the time of the Second Session of the 36th Congress in 1861, while 
      absent a significant PUBLIC DEBT, the Federalists had failed to procure 
      Jurisdiction over all of the Property contained within the several States 
      by Rights of Debt through Contractural Banking Obligations.
      <P>Finding Themselves unable to Lawfully Manipulate Credit and Monetary 
      Policy to Their own Gains, Advantages, and Benefits, the Federalists' 
      United States joined in Collusion and Conspiracy with Certain of the 
      several States, and with Certain Foreign Powers under the General Auspices 
      and Control of the Said Federalists, to Commit Treason by Unlawfully 
      Declaring War on Those Lawfully Constituted Governments of the United 
      States of America, Such War being for the Singular Purpose of Overthrowing 
      the Aforesaid Lawful Jurisdictions by Forces-Of-Arms, in a "CIVIL" 
      Counterrevolution for the Purposes of Imposing Federal Admiralty 
      Jurisdiction Upon Each of the United States of America, and upon Each of 
      THE PEOPLE habitat therein.
      <P>In 1863, in order to finance Their "CIVIL" Counterrevolutionary 
      Activities, the Federalists passed The National Currency Act of February 
      25, 1863, Such Act providing for the Issue of Commercial Paper Currency 
      Secured by a Pledge of United States' Stocks, and the Act provided for 
      "circulation and redemption thereof". See The Story of Money, Third 
      Edition (1981), published by: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 33 Liberty 
      Street, New York, N.Y., U.S.A., Postal Zone: 10045.
      <P>"The Federal Government couldn't raise enough money to pay for the 
      Civil War through bond sales and taxes. As rapidly as the treasury paid 
      bills with gold and silver coin, the metal was hoarded. Reluctantly, 
      Congress issued paper money -- U.S. notes -- that wasn't redeemable in 
      gold or silver. Congress tried making the notes acceptable by declaring 
      them "legal tender", which meant that they had to be accepted in payment 
      of all private debts. The government also began chartering "national 
      banks" which were given paper currency they could issue as their own. 
      State banks were stopped from issuing notes. National banks received 
      currency in proportion to the amount of Government bonds they purchased." 
      <P><STRONG><PURCHASED GOLD PEOPLES? THE WITH>
      <P></STRONG>This technique allowed the Federalists to draw-off THE 
      PEOPLES' Wealth replacing it with PAPER.
      <P>On December 18, 1865, the Congress enacted the Thirteenth Article 
      Amendment abolishing Involuntary Servitude while leaving VOLUNTARY 
      Servitude to Contract in its place.
      <P>By 1866, the Counterrevolution had been successful, the United States 
      had won, the United States of America had fallen and were held hostage, 
      Federal Jurisdiction and Martial Law had been Imposed, the Federal 
      Monarchy had been installed, and the Public Debt, which was soon to become 
      unquestionable, had attained a value of 2.7 Billions of Dollars-by-Weight 
      of gold or silver.
      <P>In July of 1868, the Federalists made Their Declaration of United 
      States Jurisdiction in the form and manner of the Fourteenth Article 
      Amendment to The Constitution for the United States of America. Section 1. 
      "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the 
      Jurisdiction thereof, are Citizens of the United States ...", and Section 
      4. "The validity of the public debt of the United States ... shall not be 
      questioned." (Emphasis added)
      <P>While the Thirteenth Amendment abolished PRIVATE ownership of PEOPLE, 
      the Fourteenth Amendment made possible the PUBLIC ownership of PERSONS. In 
      or about 1870, under the banner of the Census or Enumeration directed to 
      be taken within every subsequent Term of ten Years, the formal practice of 
      Birth Registration was begun, thereafter Recording Births in the Bureau Of 
      The Census, Department of Commerce.
      <P>In 1884, in Julliard v. Greenman, 110 U.S. 421, the Supreme Court 
      upheld the United States in reneging on Its Promise To Redeem Its Paper by 
      allowing Its Money Trust to enter a silent interpleader, whereupon 
      Judicial Notice was taken of a Third Party Contract resulting from 
      Julliard using His Commercial Paper Currency as security in a Transaction 
      for his 100 Bales of Cotton thus promoting the practice if Discharging 
      Debt by Obligatory Notes instead of Tendering Payment for Debt in Lawful 
      and Substantive Money in Dollars- by-Weight of gold or silver.
      <P>In 1897, the Supreme Court in the case of The Glide, 167 U.S. 623, 
      stated that:
      <P>"The Admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution 
      and laws of the United States upon the District Courts of the United 
      States is exclusive."
      <P>In 1904, the court in the case of Dailey v. New York, 128 F. 789, 
      stated that:
      <P>Jurisdiction attaches in case of a maritime contract irrespective of 
      the question whether it is to be performed on land or water."
      <P>In 1907, there was an economic depression.
      <P>On February 25, 1913, Secretary of State Knox Falsely and Fraudulently 
      Certified that the Sixteenth Article Amendment to the Constitution had 
      been Lawfully Ratified.
      <P>IT SHOULD BE NOTICED that The Sixteenth Article Amendment did not 
      REPEAL those Restrictions Imposed on the United States by Article I, 
      Section 2, Clause 3, or Article I, Section 8, Clause 1; pursuant to those 
      Directives of Article V. Even if it were valid by having been properly 
      ratified, The Sixteenth Article Amendment amended absolutely nothing 
      pertaining to the several States or the Inhabitants thereof.
      <P>The Congress, being well aware of these Facts, never ENABLED The 
      Sixteenth Amendment as Public Law by Appropriate Legislation, in that the 
      Amendment did not REPEAL the aforesaid Restrictions, and the Internal 
      Revenue Code ("Title" 26 U.S.C.) which is predicated upon the Sixteenth 
      Amendment, is now, and has always been, "Private Law" based upon Public 
      Commercial (Contractual) Law. See Amendment XXI, ratified December 5, 
      1933, for the Construction of a "REPEAL".
      <P><STRONG>SEDITION BY SYNTAX ("Public DOES NOT mean "Private".)
      <P></STRONG>More-often-than-not, Public Commercial Law has been called, 
      "PUBLIC LAW" where It is in-fact, Public Commercial Law regulating Private 
      Commercial Contracts and Interests in Equity and Contractual Performance 
      made within the Admiralty Jurisdiction.
      <P>Presumably, on April 8, 1913, the several States "VOLUNTARILY" 
      surrendered, and Consented to Deprive Themselves of, Their Rights of 
      Suffrage by the Imposition of the Seventeenth Article Amendment to the 
      Constitution, Such Amendment being an Abrogation of the Intent, Directive, 
      Legal Construction, and Relevant Structural Conditions set forth in 
      Article I, Section 3, and in Article V providing that no State, without 
      its Consent, shall be deprived of Its Equal Suffrage in the Senate.
      <P>IT SHOULD BE NOTICED that When THE PEOPLE of the several States 
      Chartered the United States as an Admiralty Jurisdiction, it WAS NOT the 
      Legislative intent of the September 1787 Congress to put into effect a 
      self-destruct mechanism, Such as could possibly make a Proposed 
      Constitutional Amendment to the several States, where, upon Its 
      Ratification through any mechanism, the Constitutional Prohibitions 
      regulating the United States would somehow cease to exist.
      <P>The Congress Itself, has never had the Power to modify The Very 
      Constitution that Created the Congress Itself (Article I, Section 8), and 
      any lawful modification done by way of Amendment, can only be made through 
      the Legislature of three-fourths of the several States, or by Conventions 
      in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may 
      be proposed by the Congress.
      <P>The Congress has been Delegated only those Seventeen (17) Powers 
      enumerated in Article I, Section 8. All other Powers NOT vested by the 
      Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department 
      or Officer thereof, are specifically reserved to THE PEOPLE for Their 
      exercise of Primary Jurisdiction over Their Respective Governments. See 
      the Tenth Article Amendment to the Constitution FOR the United States of 
      America.
      <P>The Congress, once again being well aware of these Facts, never ENABLED 
      The Seventeenth Amendment as Public Law by appropriate legislation, in 
      that the Amendment did not REPEAL Article I, Section 3, nor did it REPEAL 
      Article V of the Constitution.
      <P>During the Second Session of the 63rd Congress on December 23, 1913, 
      two days before Christmas while most of the legitimate Congress 
      vacationed, the Federal Reserve Act was passed by a Congressional Quorum 
      <QUESTIONABLE>establishing the Third National Bank, or the Functionally 
      Secret Federal Reserve Bank, System, or Corporation (hereinafter called 
      FED Corporation), on the basis of another Twenty (20) Year Charter.
      <P>The FED Corporation Act Fraudulently CONVERTED the Lawfully Delegated 
      Congressional Power To Coin Money and regulate the Value thereof, while 
      simultaneously Such Act franchised and enabled the newly created FED 
      Corporation to counterfeit Certificates, Notes, Securities, and Other 
      Obligations of the United States by providing for the Private Issue of 
      Private PAPER Currency, where such Public issue of Public PAPER Currency 
      was prohibited to the Congress by Law under Article I, Section 8, Clause 
      5; and the Coinage Act of April 1792.
      <P>The Congress effectively franchised the FED Corporation to carry out 
      that which was Unlawful and Prohibited to the Congress Itself.
      <P>IT SHOULD BE NOTICED that no constitutional Amendment pursuant to 
      Article V was ever made Such that the Article I, Section 8, Clause 5 and 
      Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 Prohibitions by the Constitution were 
      REPEALED. Consequently, the Federalists have continued to operate 
      exclusively as Special-Charter Franchisees by Underwriting and Insuring 
      the PUBLIC DEBT in the form and manner of Their FED Corporation, by way of 
      Their own "Sub-Charter" Banks, all under Private Contract Law, and all 
      within the United States' Admiralty Jurisdiction.
      <P>Amongst the rumors and presumed excuses for creating the FED 
      Corporation was the alleged creation of a theoretically "ELASTIC CURRENCY" 
      such as would supposedly s-t-r-e-t-c-h so as to avoid those economic 
      depressions as occurred in 1907.
      <P>To accomplish this, the FED Corporation printed and circulated Notes, 
      the value of which was 400% of all Lawful money in circulation. This was 
      called "fractional reserve banking" at 25% of par value.
      <P>Thus the FED Corporation printed and circulated four (4) Paper Dollars 
      for every one (1) Dollar-by-Weight of Gold or silver supposedly held in 
      reserve in The United States Treasury; thereafter, each one (1) Dollar 
      certificate had an Actual Redemption Value to twenty-five (25) cents. This 
      technique, by the way of Their FED Corporation, enabled the Federalists to 
      withdraw Gold from circulation replacing it with PAPER.
      <P>The average Man-On-The-Street was led to believe that the Paper Twenty 
      Dollar Gold Certificate that he held in his Left Hand, had the same 
      Redemption Value as the One Ounce Twenty Dollar Gold Coin that he held in 
      His Right; where in-fact, Each Twenty (20) Dollar Certificate had an 
      actual Redemption Value of Five (5) Dollars-by-Weight of Gold or Silver 
      supposedly held in reserve.
      <P>While such "Paper" obligations were prohibited from being issued by The 
      Congress Itself due to The Coinage Act of April 2, 1792, nothing 
      prohibited the FED Corporation from issuing Its PRIVATE Silver 
      Certificates and later, Its totally unredeemable FED Corporation Notes.
      <P>From 1914 to 1929, the United States Congress spent the value of four 
      (4) Paper Dollars for every one (1) Dollar-by-Weight of gold or silver 
      held in reverse in Its United States Treasury, thus the Congress 
      participated in extortionate extensions of credit through the continuing 
      re-discounting of commercial PAPER currency as performance obligations.
      <P>This technique once again enabled the Federalists to draw-off THE 
      PEOPLES' Wealth replacing it with Paper.
      <P>By 1919, the Public Debt was 25 billions of Dollars-by-Weight of gold 
      or silver.
      <P>On January 16, 1919, the Eighteenth Amendment was installed providing 
      that after One Year from the Ratification of This Article, the 
      manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the 
      importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from THE UNITED 
      STATES AND ALL TERRITORY SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION THEREOF FOR BEVERAGE 
      PURPOSES WAS PROHIBITED.
      <P>IT SHOULD BE NOTICED that United States Federal Jurisdiction to enforce 
      the Eighteenth Amendment within the Jurisdictions of the several States 
      was notably absent, as succinctly set forth in the Enabling Clause, where 
      THE CONGRESS AND THE SEVERAL STATES shall have CONCURRENT Power to enforce 
      This Article Appropriate Legislation.
      <P>This Article operated exclusively upon the UNITED STATES AND ALL 
      TERRITORY SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION THEREOF, but This Article was 
      without general Force and Effect on the several States unless Each of Such 
      several States individually volunteered to enforce the Article by 
      Appropriate Legislation.
      <P>Prohibition, as it was foisted on THE PEOPLE, provided many 
      opportunities to install a strong Federal Police Force by creating the 
      Federal Bureau of Investigation, by enhancing the Secret Service, and by 
      strengthening the preexisting Bureau of Internal Revenue, to name just 
      Three.
      <P>By October 1929, the theoretically "ELASTIC CURRENCY" had s-t-r-e-t- 
      ch-e-d to the point where the Public Debt was 17 Billions of Dollars- 
      byWeight of gold or silver.
      <P>By June of 1933, at the termination of Its Twenty (20) Year Charter, 
      after having ravaged the Nation with Four (4) years of Depression By 
      Design, the FED Corporation Called Its outstanding United States' 
      obligations. The United States' Treasury was bankrupt, and the 
      creditdiscounted value of Its commercial PAPER currency had s-t-r-e-t- 
      c-h-e-d to such proportions that the Congress was forced to declare an 
      undeclared bankruptcy, without ever having explained the undefined 
      "emergency" mentioned in House Joint Resolution 192, and without ever 
      having notified THE PEOPLE At-Large of the Aspects, Conditions, Nature, or 
      Causes of the Said emergency.
      <P>"HJR 192 JOINT RESOLUTION TO SUSPEND THE GOLD STANDARD AND ABROGATE THE 
      GOLD CLAUSE, JUNE 5, 1933 (H.J. Res.192 73rd Cong., 1st Sess.)
      <P>Joint resolution to assure uniform value to the coins and currencies of 
      the United States.
      <P>Whereas the holding of or dealing in gold affect the public interest, 
      and are therefore subject to proper regulation and restriction; and
      <P>Whereas the existing emergency has disclosed that provisions of 
      obligation which purport to give the obligee a right to require payment in 
      gold or a particular kind of coin or currency of the United States, or in 
      an amount in money of the United States measured thereby, obstruct the 
      power of Congress to regulate the value of the money of the United States, 
      and are inconsistent with the declared policy of the Congress to maintain 
      at all times the equal power of every dollar, coined or issued by the 
      United States, in the markets and in the payment of debts. Now, therefore, 
      be it
      <P>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
      States of America in Congress assembled, That [a] every provision 
      contained in or made with respect to any obligation which purports to give 
      the obligee a right to require payment in gold or a particular kind of 
      coin or currency, or in an amount in money of the United States measured 
      thereby, is declared to be against public policy; and no such provision 
      shall be contained in or made with respect to any obligation hereafter 
      incurred. Every obligation, heretofore or hereafter incurred, whether or 
      not any such provision contained therein or made with respect thereto, 
      shall be discharged upon payment, dollar for dollar, in any coin or 
      currency which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and 
      private debts.
      <P>Any such provision contained in any law authorizing obligations to be 
      issued by or under authority of the United States, is hereby repealed, but 
      the repeal of any such provision shall not invalidate any other provision 
      or authority contained in such law.
      <P>(b) As used in this resolution, the term "obligation" means an 
      obligation (including every obligation of and to the United States, 
      excepting currency) payable in money of the United States; and the term 
      "coin or currency" means coin or currency of the United States, including 
      Federal Reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal Reserve banks and 
      national banking associations.
      <P>SEC. 2. The last sentence of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of section 
      43 of the Act entitled "An Act to relieve the existing national economic 
      emergency by increasing agricultural purchasing power, to raise revenue 
      for extraordinary expenses incurred by reason of such emergency, to 
      provide emergency relief with respect to agricultural indebtedness, to 
      provide for the orderly liquidation of joint-stock land banks, and for 
      other purposes", approved May 12, 1933 is amended to read as follows:
      <P>"All coins and currencies of the United States (including Federal 
      Reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal Reserve banks and national 
      banking associations) heretofore or hereafter coined or issued, shall be 
      legal tender for all debts, public and private, public charges, taxes, 
      duties, and dues, except that gold coins, when below the standard wight 
      and limit of tolerance provided by law for the single piece, shall be 
      legal tender only at valuation in proportion to their actual weight." 
      Approved, June 5, 1933, 4:40 P.M."
      <P>Thus On June 5th 1933, the United States Treasury was foreclosed upon 
      by the FED Corporation because the United States' Treasury could no longer 
      pay Its Credit obligations on Its commercial PAPER currency.
      <P>SEDITION BY SYNTAX ("Department of the Treasury" DOES NOT mean "United 
      States Treasury Department".)
      <P>Upon making the foregoing UNDECLARED "declaration of bankruptcy", the 
      Federalists' Congress began CONVERTING those ALLODIAL LAND TITLES that 
      were Privately Owned by THE PEOPLE, At-Large.
      <P>In June of 1933, the Pennsylvania State Legislature pledged the 
      privately owned Allodial Land Titles belonging to THE PEOPLE of the State 
      of Pennsylvania, as security for Its portion of the PUBLIC DEBT (Penn. PL 
      111). Also see California Government Code Section 126 generally, and 
      specifically Section 126(c). The result of pledging Such Titles as 
      Security for a perpetual PUBLIC DEBT is: that upon Default by the United 
      States, Ownership of the "Pledged" Land will revert to "Public" Federalist 
      Control in satisfaction of Their "Public Debt".
      <P>After Fraudulently Pledging Such Titles in which the United States had 
      NO LAWFUL INTEREST, The Congress soon thereafter, began another of Its 
      "borrowing-spending" sprees designed to spend-out the Values of those 
      Privately Owned Land Titles.
      <P>In August of 1933, an Executive Order Issued making it illegal for 
      private Americans to own or trade in gold.
      <P>On December 5, 1933, The Eighteenth Article Amendment, having fulfilled 
      Its designed purposes, was REPEALED by the Twenty-first Article Amendment, 
      and like the Eleventh, Twelfth, Fourteenth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth, 
      Eighteenth, Twentieth, Twenty-Second, and Twenty-Fifth Amendments, the 
      Twenty-First Article Amendment was never ENABLED as Public Law by 
      Appropriate Legislation.
      <P>In 1934, the Federalists passed The 1934 Gold Reserve Act which 
      Proclaimed that gold could not be used as a medium of domestic exchange, 
      and made it illegal for private Americans or firms to own Gold Bullion. 
      This the Act effectively withdrew all remaining Gold from Monetary 
      Circulation by requiring that it be tendered to the Federal Government. 
      Additionally, the Act also restricted private ownership of gold to those 
      who must use gold for industrial or export purposes (a restriction that 
      was rescinded as of December 31, 1974).
      <P>Once again the average Man-on-the-street was lead to believe that the 
      Paper One Dollar Silver Certificate that he held in his left hand, was of 
      the same Redemption Value as the Silver Dollar that He held in his Right.
      <P>The Gold Reserve Act was enforced under the Police Powers of the United 
      States by the Internal Revenue Service, and Those who failed to 
      relinquish, or refused to tender Their Gold to the Federal Government in 
      exchange for Its Paper, were faced with the confiscation of Their 
      Property, Arrest, Trial, Fines, penalties, and/or Imprisonment.
      <P>In 1935 the Social Security (old-age retirement) "Insurance" Act (49 
      Stat 620) was created by the Congress providing:
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>for the establishment of the Social Security Board; 
        <LI>for the issue of a Social Security Account Number to those who 
        VOLUNTEERED to "Join The March To Social Security"; 
        <LI>that Such Social Security Account Number was, on its face, "NOT FOR 
        IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES"; and 
        <LI>that One would VOLUNTARILY have one-half of one percent (0.005) of 
        the value of one's Wages withheld and deposited into the Social Security 
        TRUST FUND from which, upon living to age sixty-five (65), One could 
        draw some small allotment, Such that One was not utterly destitute in 
        One's twilight years. </LI></OL>The Social Security Act was later codified 
      under Title 42 U.S.C., and is enacted under the "civil rights" provisions 
      of the Fourteenth Article Amendment to the Constitution.
      <P>In 1939 The Congress passed the Public Salaries Tax Act which imposed 
      an "income" tax on every "Public" Employee.
      <P>In 1942 the Congress passed the "Victory Tax Act" (a direct tax) 
      wherein five percent (0.05) of the value of One's wages was levied, 
      withheld, and converted toward the war effort as an "income" tax.
      <P>The "Victory Tax Act" was unlawful on its face in that it violated 
      Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, and Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the 
      Constitution; however, the nation was at War, and no one really complained 
      too loudly about the Violations and Illegalities of Such Act, although 
      vocal oppositions to Such Violations and Illegalities are noted in the 
      Congressional Records pertaining thereto.
      <P>In 1944 the "Victory Tax Act" was repealed by the Congress.
      <P>In 1945 the Congress passed the "McCarren Act" which provides that ALL 
      "Insurance" be regulated in Interstate Commerce pursuant to Article I, 
      Section *, Clause 3 of the Constitution. See "McCarren Act" -- Black's 
      5th, Page 883, "Internal Security" -- Black's 5th Page 732, "Internal 
      Security Acts" -- Black's 5th, Page 732, Title 18 U.S.C. 2385 and 2386.
      <P>In 1961 the Congress decided to violate the Contractual Restriction 
      that the Social Security Account Number was "NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION 
      PURPOSES" BY USING SUCH NUMBER FOR IDENTIFICATION.
      <P>In 1968 Silver was withdrawn as the Substantive Security, Protection, 
      and Indemnification supporting the value and buying-power of the Paper One 
      Dollar Silver Certificate, and Such withdrawal of "backing" was 
      accompanied by further extensions of fractional-reserve lending,
      <P>Meanwhile, the Social Security Trust Fund was technically and 
      functionally abolished, and those funds that still remained, after 
      extensive government "burrowing", were ultimately CONVERTED by adding them 
      to the General (revolving) Fund, where such Funds promptly "revolved" 
      right out of existence.
      <P>Once again the average Man-On-The_street was led to believe that the 
      PAPER One Dollar Federal Reserve Note that he held in His left hand, was 
      of the same redemption value as the PAPER One Dollar Silver Certificate 
      that he held in His Right, and That was the Truth.
      <P>By 1976 the Social Security Account Number was used to "Identify" Each 
      of THE PEOPLE, At-Large as a United States "person" and the Congress added 
      Title 26 U.S.C. 6109 (d) to sanctify its own betrayal.
      <P>Thus culminating in HJR 192, the Federalists' Congress had abrogated 
      Article I, Section 8, Clause 2 by digressing from borrowing money on the 
      credit of the United States, through borrowing credit on the money of the 
      United States, through borrowing credit on the money of THE PEOPLE 
      AtLarge, through borrowing credit on the credit of the United States, 
      through borrowing credit on the privately held Allodial Land Titles of THE 
      PEOPLE within several States, to borrowing credit on the perpetual 
      servitude and continued mandatory performance of THE PEOPLE themselves.
      <P>Thus when all was said and done, direct Taxes were still required to be 
      apportioned AMONG THE SEVERAL STATES; all Duties, Imposts, and Excises 
      were still required to be uniform; No ... direct, Tax could be laid, 
      unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration; and no tax or Duty 
      could be laid on Articles-in-Commerce exported from any State.

        established governments of the several States of the American Union, the 
        establishment of a new constitutional monarchy; 
        <LI>the unmitigated theft of private property, and; 
        <LI>MOST IMPORTANTLY, that ALL Insurance is a maritime contract, and 
        therefore Admiralty Jurisdiction, wherein Jurisdiction attaches in case 
        of a maritime contract irrespective of the question whether it is to be 
        performed on land or water. </LI></UL><STRONG>BACKGROUND
      <P></STRONG>AS NATURE'S GOD CREATED MANKIND and established His Right 
      therein, then that Mankind exists, compels the presumption juris et de 
      jure, that Mans' Rights to Live and His Rights to defend His Life began as 
      a genetic heritage which successfully existed and operated through 
      Millenniums dating the inception of the Time Continuum itself; thus all of 
      Mans' Right predate His Instruments, and Mankinds' Rights to Life, His 
      Rights to defend His Life, and His Rights of TITLE-TO-SELF have existed 
      long antecedent to the formation of all constitution, and of all other 
      such Instruments. See "juris et de jure" Blacks 5th, page 767.
      <P>Accordingly, THE PEOPLE are the Lawful Heirs to Hereditaments, both 
      Corporeal and Incorporeal, by Hereditary Succession, inclusive of the 
      Highest Titles to those individual Properties known and described as THE 
      PEOPLE Themselves, Sui Juris.
      <P>Likewise the fact that THE PEOPLE physically exist as Human Life Forms, 
      clearly establishes Their Rights to Live, Their Self-Rights of 
      TITLE-TO-SELF, and Their Rights to defend Their Lives which began, 
      existed, and successfully operated through Their individual Genetic 
      Linages and Heritages, wherein all such Rights have existed long 
      antecedent to the formation of any constitution; consequently, THE PEOPLE 
      are required to make NO CLAIMS for any so-called "rights" that might have 
      been accidently enumerated or stipulated to in the Text(s) of any such 
      Instrument.
      <P>As Instruments, Mankind created constitutions, or Social Contracts or 
      Compacts, thereby created governments. See "Social Contracts or Compacts", 
      Black's 5th, Page 1246.
      <P>PLEASE NOTICE that NO constitution ever provided THE PEOPLE with Rights 
      that They did not already possess prior to creation of such Instrument.
      <P>Existence and formal recognition of preexistent Rights is demonstrated 
      throughout The Magna Carta, June 15, 1215; the Declaration of Rights in 
      Congress, at New York, October 19, 1765; the Declaration of Rights in 
      Congress, at Philadelphia, October 14, 1774; the Declaration of 
      Independence July 4, 1776; the Articles of Confederation, November 15, 
      1777; and the Bill of Rights inclusive of the Ninth and Tenth Article 
      Amendments, December 15, 1791, etc.
      <P>PLEASE NOTICE that throughout all of the Aforementioned Instruments, it 
      cannot be proved that THE PEOPLE are subservient to any conditions of any 
      such Instruments, nor to any conditions set forth or decreed by any pseudo 
      sovereign.
      <P>By the conspicuous absence of Declarations of Subservience, it must be 
      presumed that the Colonists did not want to forfeit their Rights to any 
      sovereign, thus those so-called "rights" that were enumerated or 
      stipulated to in the Texts of Their Instruments, are in-fact, a series of 
      stringent Power limitations that operate NOT upon THE PEOPLE, but upon 
      Their governments so as to hopefully eliminate their traditionally 
      Lawless, inherently Sleezoid, Criminal Activities. See the Declaration of 
      Independence as the Colonists' Criminal Indictment against George III.
      <P>IT SHOULD BE NOTICED that no Legislature has ever made ANY Lawful Act 
      that operates directly on THE PEOPLE at-large, simply because They do not 
      have the Power to make Such an Act. See Article I., Section 8.
      <P>The Constitution itself is recognized amongst the Laws Of Nations, as a 
      Common-Law Charter providing, in part, for the admittance of admiralty 
      Jurisdiction onto the land pursuant to the Law Merchant (Black's 5th, page 
      798) within those geographic limits set forth in Article I., Section 8, 
      Clause 17.
      <P>Contracts made pursuant to Such Constitution operate in pari materia 
      with other Commercial or Mercantile statutes emanating from the Roman 
      Civil Jurisdictions, which are exercised under admiralty Jurisdiction in 
      LondonTown proper and in Washington, D.C., etc., where Such contracts are 
      generally identified or recognized throughout the World under the Laws of 
      Nations (Black's 5th, page 733), as having been conducted under Flag Law.

      <P>PLEASE NOTICE the military <ADMIRALTY>flag in every courtroom.
      <P>Article III., Section 1 provides that "The Judicial Power of the United 
      States, shall be vested in one Supreme court, and in such inferior courts 
      as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish." Article I., 
      Section 8, Clause 9 provides that "The Congress shall have Power To 
      constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme court;" and all such Article 
      I courts operate solidly within the admiralty Jurisdiction since the 
      Congress and the United States Itself so operates.
      <P>IT SHOULD BE NOTICED that "The judicial Power of the United States, 
      ..." formed in the admiralty Jurisdiction , is what is being discussed in 
      THIS portion of the Constitution.
      <P>Article III., Section 2. provides that The Judicial Power shall extend 
      to all Cases , in Law and Equity, arising under the Constitution, the Laws 
      of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under 
      their Authority; thus the judicial Power extends: 
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>to all Cases, affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and 
        Consuls <AT-LAW>; 
        <LI>to all Cases, of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction <IN ADMIRALTY>; 

        <LI>to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party <IN 
        ADMIRALTY>; 
        <LI>to all Controversies between two or more States <AT-LAW>; 
        <LI>to Controversies between a State and Citizens of another State 
        <AT-LAW>; 
        <LI>to Controversies between Citizens of different States <IN 
        ADMIRALTY>; 
        <LI>to Controversies between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands 
        under Grants of different States <IN ADMIRALTY>; and 
        <LI>to Cases between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and a foreign 
        thereof, and foreign States, Citizens, or Subjects <AT-LAW>.
        <P></P></LI></UL>Only in Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public 
      Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be a Party, does 
      the supreme court have original Jurisdiction <AT-LAW>. In all other cases, 
      the supreme Court has appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law <IN 
      ADMIRALTY>and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as 
      the Congress shall make.
      <P>IT SHOULD BE NOTICED that the Jurisdiction of the supreme Court is 
      subservient to the legislative branch because Article III., Section 2 
      states that "... the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction ... 
      under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.", (pursuant to Article 
      I., Section 8, Clause 9); therefore, ALL APPEALS ARE APPEALS- IN-EQUITY, 
      MADE WITHIN THE ADMIRALTY JURISDICTION.
      <P>Each constitution FOR each of the several States of the American Union, 
      embraces the Constitution FOR the United States of America; thus, each 
      State government is established in admiralty to regulate Commerce.
      <P>Clearly then, whether brought in a State, or in a United States' court, 
      ANY "appeal" as to Law or Fact filed in ANY "appellate" court, is being 
      brought in the admiralty Jurisdiction because an "appeal" in the technical 
      sense, was unknown to the Common-Law, and it is the name of proceedings 
      for the review of cases in equity, and in the ecclesiastical and admiralty 
      courts. See HANDBOOK OF COMMON-LAW PLEADING (Hornbook Series) by: Benjamin 
      J. Shipman, First Copyright 1894, Last Copyright 1923, Sections 337-338, 
      page 537.
      <P>Then At-Law, the Analog of an "equity appeal" is the Trial de novo 
      based on filing the Writ-Of-Error. See "trial" Black's 5th, page 1348. See 
      "writs" Black's 5th, page 1441.
      <P>Philosophically, the differences between Law and Equity are precisely 
      those between deductive and inductive thinking. Deductive logic looks 
      backwards, examining the general facts leading to a specific set of 
      conclusions; whereas, inductive reasoning looks in basing its general 
      presumption on a selected set of few specific facts, upon which It derives 
      Its General Conclusion, leading to equitable presumption and PRE-VENGE 
      that is: a sort-of irrefutable revenge in-advance.
      <P>Article III., Sectional 2: "The trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of 
      Impeachment, shall be Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State 
      where the said Crimes shall have been committed; ..."
      <P>Apparently there were no plans for United States "crime" trial.
      <P>If this were true, the United States' District Courts would not have 
      territorial Jurisdiction since such courts do not legally lie within the 
      "State where the said Crimes shall have been committed;..."
      <P>Correspondingly then, the land upon which such District Courts were 
      located, would have been PURCHASED BY the CONSENT of the Legislature of 
      the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, 
      Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings, in which 
      event, the United States should be able to produce Its Title to Such 
      Property.
      <P>Article I., Section 8, Clause 17 provides that Congress exercise 
      exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such courts, 
      presumedly categorized as "needful Buildings" since (some of the time) 
      they do not actually qualify as Forts. Magazines, Arsenal, or dock- Yards.
      <P>Article III., Section 2: "... but when not committed within any State, 
      <SUCH event which in States, United the committed therefore been having 
      crime>the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by 
      <ADMIRALTY>Law have directed."
      <P>What provides United States' Jurisdiction in admiralty? Is insurance an 
      admiralty contract?
      <P>The fact that PROCEDURES of Law and Equity were merged in the latter 
      1930's, does not for a single moment imply that the statutory laws have 
      superseded and/or replaced those bases of jurisprudence upon which are 
      predicated, Law, Equity and all those other Courts of Executive Chancery, 
      no more than Legislative Enactments or Supreme Court decisions can 
      overturn, supersede, replace, or unweave the very fabric of the 
      Constitutional Charters AT LAW, which first created Their very existence 
      IN the ADMIRALTY Jurisdiction Itself.
      <P>As far as the 1938 Erie R.R. decision proclaiming that there is no 
      longer a general federal Common-Law, We Present that: there never was "a 
      general federal Common-Law", since the admiralty jurisdiction has never, 
      cannot, and will never recognize the Common-Law! Common-Law and admiralty 
      are equal and opposite Jurisdictions.
      <P>IT SHOULD BE NOTICED that nowhere in the Constitution is it stated that 
      the Supreme Court has the Power to interpret the very Constitution that 
      created such court, Itself. See "interpret" and "interpretation" Black's 
      5th, pages 733 and 734.
      <P>Otherwise, it is entirely conceivable for government to activate a 
      self-destruct mechanism such that the Legislative and Executive Branches 
      could amend the Constitution in such a manner as to abolish the 
      Constitution itself. Thereafter, the Supreme Court, in its "interpretive" 
      and "legislative" capacity, could uphold such Act by proclaiming It as 
      having been Constitutional! Think about it. If one hires an employee under 
      a contract-of-performance, can the employee unilaterally modify the Said 
      contract by arbitrarily deciding not to abide by the terms thereof? We 
      believe not. 
      <P>
      <CENTER>
      <H3>PART 3.1</H3></CENTER><STRONG>JURISDICTION or WHO OWNS WHOM?
      <P></STRONG>Jurisdiction is purely and simply the Authority or Power to 
      Act. When One is exercising Jurisdiction over One's Self or over One's 
      Property or Liberties, "Jurisdiction" is called "Rights" which are 
      inclusive of those Liberties permitted within the limits of the 
      Common-Law. "LIBERTY. Freedom from restraint. The faculty of willing, and 
      the power of doing what has been willed, without influence from without. 
      Natural liberty is the right which nature gives to all mankind of 
      disposing of their persons and property after the manner they judge most 
      consistent with their happiness, on condition of their acting within the 
      limits of the law of nature and so as not to interfere with an equal 
      exercise of the same rights by other men. Burlam. c. 3, Section 15; 1 Bla, 
      Com. 125. It is called by Lieber social liberty, and is defined as the 
      protection or unrestrained action in as high a degree as the claim of 
      protection of each individual admits of. Personal liberty consists in the 
      power of locomotion, of changing situation, of removing one's person to 
      whatever place one's inclination may direct, without imprisonment or 
      restraint unless by due course of law. 1 Bla. Com. 134; Hare, Const. L. 
      777."; Bouvier's Volume 2, Page 1964 et seq.
      <P>When one is exercising Jurisdiction over Another's Being or over 
      Another's Rights, Property, or Liberties, "Jurisdiction" is called 
      "Powers" which INCLUDE ONLY those Powers permitted within the limits of a 
      voluntary contractual agreement, or by the results of a Common- Law Suit. 
      See"include" Black's 5th, page 687.
      <P>Otherwise, Jurisdiction can be Lawfully acquired ONLY by Permission of 
      He who has It, and It can ONLY be enforced by Forces of Arms resulting in 
      either the retention of, or the forfeiture of, Rights as Property.
      <P>Since all of Man has Rights, and since Rights ABSOLUTELY cannot 
      conflict, Man has established courts to settle differences between Men who 
      would claim the same Rights at the same time, Such courts theoretically 
      avoiding some needless Bloodshed in Man's Trials-of Rights by Battle.
      <P>To function as Such, courts require Jurisdiction in the manner of 
      Authority or Power to act, and Such Jurisdiction is properly divided into 
      three distinct classifications: 
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>In Personam 
        <LI>Subject-Matter 
        <LI>Territorial (venue), all of which are required to be proved by the 
        Movant prior to proceeding in any Suit, inclusive of any Criminal Suit 
        brought by and under any police state powers.
        <P></P></LI></OL><STRONG>JURISDICTION 
      <P></STRONG>"The word is a term of large and comprehensive import, and 
      embraces every kind of judicial action. ... It is the authority by which 
      courts and judicial officers take cognizance of and decide case. ... The 
      legal right by which judges exercise their authority. ... It exist when 
      court has cognizance of class of cases involved, proper parties are 
      present, and point to be decided is within powers of court. ... power and 
      authority of a court to hear and determine a judicial proceeding. ... The 
      right and power of a court to adjudicate concerning the subject matter of 
      a given case." Black's 5th, page 766.
      <P>Notice the words: "authority", "legal right", "powers" of court, 
      "power" and "authority" of a court, "right" and "power" of a court ... .
      <P>Rights and Powers are Property, and like water, "authority", "legal 
      right", and "power", must flow from a Higher Source to a lower recipient. 
      Put another way: "Authority", "legal right", and "power" and all other 
      Property is required to be Lawfully transferred from an Owner (Donor) to a 
      lower recipient (Donee). See Black's 5th, page 439.
      <P>Whom do you suppose provides the "authority", "legal right", and 
      "power" to a court? The non-existent SOVEREIGN that is prohibited by 
      Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 and Article I., Section 10, Clause 1, or 
      the Party to a "suit of the King's peace" (Black's, page 1286) in the 
      manner of form of a criminal Action? CRIMINAL ACTION. "Proceeding by which 
      person charged with a crime is brought to trial and either found not guilt 
      or guilty and sentenced. An action, suit, or cause instituted to punish an 
      infraction of the criminal laws." Black's 5th, page 336.
      <P>The transfer of Jurisdiction ("authority", "legal right", "power") is 
      based on the events surrounding One's appearance in ANY court action. 
      APPEARANCE. "A coming into court by a party to a suit, either in person or 
      by attorney, whether as plaintiff or defendant. The formal proceeding by 
      which a defendant submits himself to the Jurisdiction of the court. The 
      voluntary submission to a court's Jurisdiction." Black's page 89. 
      <P><STRONG>ATTORNEY AND CLIENT 
      <P></STRONG>"His first duty is to the courts and the public, not to the 
      client. And where ever the duties of his client conflict with those, he 
      owes as an officer of the court in the administration of Justice, the 
      former must yield to the latter." Corpus Juris Secundum Vol. 7, Section 4. 

      <P><STRONG>IN THE GENERAL JURISDICTION
      <P></STRONG>Thus if one makes a general appearance in an action, it is 
      presumed that he has voluntarily appeared to confer general jurisdiction 
      on to a court; that is: full and complete jurisdiction is presumed to have 
      voluntarily conferred onto the judge to act in the capacity of a proper 
      (statutory) judicial officer.
      <P>Under General Jurisdiction, if the Movant in a given Action happens to 
      be some division of the Executive Branch of Government, DMV or IRS for 
      instance, and if on Its Own Motion, A Court decides to proceed against a 
      Nonparticipant Individual, by presumption of Jurisdiction while absent any 
      actual presentation of proof of Jurisdiction by the Movant, then during 
      the period of time that the court acts and answers for the Movant 
      (Prosecutor), Who would be Acting for The Court, since the tribunal would 
      be standing Legally Vacant?
      <P>Also if the court (Judicially) Acts for the Movant-Prosecutor 
      (Executive), does it not create Conflicts-Of-Interest as established by 
      the Seperation-Of-Powers doctrine, and is it not in Violation thereof? See 
      "Violation", Black's page 1408.
      <P>If a judge were Contractually Disable to the Benefit of a Party to an 
      Action, could the Same Judge Properly sit and Act in the Capacity of an 
      Independent Judicial Officer? DISABILITY. "The want of legal capacity. 
      'Incapacity to do a legal act.' It would include the resignation of a 
      judge before signing a bill of exceptions; McIntyre v. Modern Woodman of 
      America, 200 Fed. 1, 2 C. C. A. 1." Bouvier's Volume i, Page 876.
      <P>If Such Judge were shown to hold ANY License or other Privilige- 
      OfState (driver, etc.), it would follow that Such Judge would also be 
      Personally Subject to the Jurisdiction of some Executive Branch of 
      government, DMV, for instance; and because Such Judge were personally 
      subject to the Same Jurisdiction that the Movant would attempt to enforce 
      upon the Nonparticipant Individual, Conflicts-Of-Interest would arise by 
      way of the Seperation-Of-Powers doctrine, sufficient to cause recusation. 
      See Black's 5th, page 1148.
      <P>Likewise, if the Said Judge files for, and/or pays a California State 
      or a United States' federal income tax , pursuant to the Public Salaries 
      Tax Act (1939) et sqq., not only do Conflicts-Of-Interest arise by way of 
      the Seperation-Of-Powers doctrine, but there also exists a blatant 
      violation and abrogation of Article III., Section l wherein:
      <P>"... The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall ... 
      receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished 
      during their Continuance in Office."
      <P>A Judge Who is subject to the jurisdiction of the executive branch, 
      cannot be impartial in matters concerning such executive branch. This 
      statement is fully and completely realized in: Lord et al. v. Kelly et al. 
      Civ. A. 63-932 240 F.Supp 67 at Page 69 (1965).
      <P>"The original appearance in this Court by counsel for the Government 
      was, if not insolent, at least none too respectful. The brief filed 
      following the Court's adverse decision and asking for reconsideration 
      thereof, showed more than hurt feelings and came close to being worthy of 
      a rebuke.
      <P>More than once the judges of a court have been indirectly reminded that 
      they personally are taxpayers. No sophisticated person is unaware that 
      even in this very Commonwealth the Internal Revenue Service has been in 
      possession of facts with respect to public officials which has presented 
      or shelved in order to serve what can only be called political ends, be 
      they high or low. And a judge who knows the score the score is aware that 
      every time his decisions offend the Internal Revenue Service he is 
      inviting a close inspection of his own returns."
      <P>If One were to argue that the Article III prohibition against 
      diminishing the Judges' Compensation, operates upon United States' Judges 
      of those inferior Courts (Article I., Section 8, Clause 9), which the 
      Congress has from time to time ordained and established; and that Such 
      prohibition DOES NOT attach to Judges on the States' Levels; then Such 
      argument remains to defy the Seperation-Of-Powers Doctrine which is 
      applicable on ALL Levels and which thereby demands an Independent 
      Judiciary extending to all Cases, in Law and Equity, regardless.
      <P>Just as those Cases brought in the Common-Law Jurisdiction require the 
      Independent Jury Of-One's-Peers, those Commercial (Equity-Contract) Cases 
      brought in the admiralty Jurisdiction pursuant to Enactments and Contracts 
      or Maritime Claims respectively, require the Independent Judiciary Such 
      that It is free from Executive, Legislative, and all other external 
      forces, influences, and imminent manipulations.
      <P>Assuming for the Argument, that a court of General Jurisdiction has 
      been convened within the district wherein the "crime" shall have been 
      committed, thus satisfying Territorial requirements; and assuming that the 
      Nonparticipant Individual, is physically under the state's arrest, 
      custody, and control (not necessarily Lawfully), thereby presumably 
      satisfying In Personam Jurisdictional requirements by Forces of Arms; then 
      there still remains Subject-Matter Jurisdiction to be proved by the 
Movant.
      <P>Exactly what Insurable Interest does the Movant (plaintiff) have in a 
      Nonparticipant Individual's Property, such as could cause attachment of 
      Subject-Matter Jurisdiction over Such Property? See Insurable Interest". 
      Black's 5th, Page 720.
      <P>If One uses One's Own Time and Energy (Property in the form of One's 
      Nonrenewable resource), to work (kds/dt) as a common-Right-matter in 
      exchange for Payment (Property in Value of Exchange); and if One uses Such 
      Property In Value Of Exchange to buy, say, an Automobile (Property), how 
      does California, for instance, obtain a legal interest in the Said 
      Automobile, sufficient that It can regulate, tax, control, and prohibit 
      the Nonparticipant Individual's free use of His Own(ed) Private Property? 
      <P><STRONG>PROPERTY. 
      <P></STRONG>"That which is peculiar or proper to any person; that which 
      belongs exclusively to one; in the strict legal sense, an aggregate of 
      rights which are guaranteed and protected by the government. <EM>

      <P>From the above definition of "Property", it would appear that 
      California has somehow managed to become the Legal Owner of the 
      Nonparticipant Individual's Property .
      <P>How then, did California obtain Title to the Said Private Property?
      <P>If California Incorporated were to claim Title to the Public Rights Of 
      Way. Such Rights-Of-Way would have become Private Privileges of way.
      <P>The Facts remain that these Properties have either originated as 
      Private Toll Roads or as Highways in the Public Domain long antecedent to 
      the formation of California itself.
      <P>How then did California obtain Titles to the Said Private and Public 
      Properties?
      <P>Now if it were presumed that a "crime" were committed, Who and Where is 
      the Victim, damaged Party, or Real and actual Party-of-Interest?
      <P>If it is presumed that California, in Its Corporate Capacity, were 
      somehow damaged by way of some Nonparticipant Individual's nonadherence to

      actually damaged and to what extent?

        fact that EACH of ALL of the State of California would have by then 
        become Parties-Of-Interest to the outcome of Such Legal Mass-Action 
        therefore EACH of ALL of the People of the State of California could no

        <P></P></LI></OL>From where then, would an Impartial Jury be drawn?

      <P>The foregoing can occur only under private contract-law exclusively 
      within the admiralty Jurisdiction as defined in Article I, Section 8, 
      Clause 17 otherwise the separation of powers doctrines forbid general
