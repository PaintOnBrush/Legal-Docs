<BODY>Alabama: “There are only two elements in the corpus delecti of an offense: 
(1) That a certain result has been produced, and (2) that a person is criminally 
responsible for that result.”  Ex parte Slaton, 680 So.2d 909, 925 (Ala. 1996). 
““Corpus delecti” consists of two elements: that a certain result has been 
produced that some person is criminally responsible for the act.”  Johnson v. 
State, 473 So.2d 607, 609. “Thus, although a certain section of Amendment III 
appears on its face to be discriminatory, because “plaintiff in this case 
alleged that he or she suffered an injury under this section, no case or 
controversy was ever presented to the trial court to invoke its jurisdiction…”
 “Under Alabama law, every action in tort consists of three elements: The 
existence of a legal duty by defendant to plaintiff; a breach of that duty; and 
damage as the proximate result.  Alabama Power Co. v. Guy, 281 Ala. 583, 206 
So.2d 594, 599 (1967).”  Dobbs v. Alabama Power Co., 549 So.2d 35, 36 (Ala. 
1989). “To present a justiciable case or controversy, the individual plaintiff 
must have standing to sue; to have standing, the individual must allege an 
injury directly arising from or connected with the wrong alleged.  The standing 
requirement applies whether the plaintiff sues individually or on behalf of a 
class.”  Ex Parte Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Alabama, 582 So2d 469, 474…
 “When a party without standing purports to commence an action, the trial court 
acquires no subject matter jurisdiction.  Barshop v. Medina County Underground 
Water Conservation District, 925 S.W.2d 618, 626…(‘standing is a necessary 
component of subject matter jurisdiction’).  See also Rames v. Bryd , 521 US 
811…(‘“standing is perhaps the most important of [the jurisdictional] 
doctrines’”); National Organization for Women, Inc., v. Scheidler , 510 US 
249…(‘standing represents a jurisdictional requirement which remains open to 
review at all stages of the litigation’)…(‘standing is a jurisdictional 
prerequisite  to every case and may be raised at any stage of the 
proceedings’)…”  Ex parte James, 836 So2d 813, 871, 872-873. “Standing requires 
an injury in fact…When a party without standing puports to commence an action, 
the trial court acquires no subject matter jurisdiction…If a named plaintiff has 
not been injured by the wrong alleged in the complaint, then no case or 
controversy is presented…A party’s injury must be “tangible,”…”  Kid’s Care, 
Inc. v. Ala. Dept’ of Hum. Res., 843 So.2d 164, 166-167 (Ala. 2002). “Standing 
turns on whether the party has been injured in fact and whether the injury is to 
a legally protected right.”  Walters v. Stewart, 838 So.2d 1047. “Judicial power 
is authority vested in some court, officer or person, to hear and determine when 
the rights of person or property, or the propriety of doing an act, are the 
subject-matter of adjudication.”  State v. Jelks, 35 So. 60, 62. Alaska: “Degree 
of injury required under interest-injury standing need not be great; an 
“identifiable trifle” is said to suffice to fight out a question of principal.”  
Alaskans for a Common Language, Inc. v. Kritz, 3 P.3d 906 (Alaska 2000). “State 
courts grant standing to any person who can show injury-in-fact.”  In re 
Dissolution of Marriage of Alaback, 997 P.2d 1181. “the duty of this court, as 
of every judicial tribunal, is limited to determining rights of persons or of 
property, which are actually controverted in the particular case before it.”  
Tyler v. Judges of the Court of Registration, 179 U.S. 405, 21 SCt. 206, 208. 
 Arizona: “All political power is inherent in the people, and governments derive 
their just powers from the consent of the governed, and are established to 
protect and maintain individual rights.”  Arizona constitution article II § 2. 
“it is declared that the public policy of this state and the general purposes of 
the provisions of this title [criminal code title 13] are: 1. To proscribe 
conduct that unjustifiably and inexcusably causes or threatens substantial harm 
to individual or public interests.”  Arizona criminal code § 13-101 . “Two 
elements comprise the corpus delecti of a crime: (1) the basic injury…(2) the 
fact that the basic injury was the result of a criminal, rather than a natural 
or accidental, cause.  State v. Thomas, 78 Ariz. 52, 59, 275 P.2d 408, 413 
(1954).”  State v. Atwood, 832 P.2d 593, 614, 171 Ariz. 576. “In Arizona, both 
“but for” causation and proximate cause must be established in a criminal case.” 
 State v. Marty, 801 P.2d 468, 471, 166 Ariz. 233. “If such preliminary proof 
has been submitted the confession or statements may then be used to assist in 
proving the corpus delecti beyond a reasonable doubt, the degree necessary for 
conviction.”  State v. Hernandez, 320 P.2d 476, 469, 83 Ariz. 279. “In order to 
establish corpus delecti, state must prove that a certain result has been 
produced and that someone is criminally responsible for that result.”  State v. 
Gerlaugh, 654 P.2d 800, 134 Ariz. 164. “To establish corpus delecti, there must 
be some proof that a certain result has been produced and that someone is 
criminally responsible for the act.”  State v. Pineda, 519 P.2d 41, 100 Ariz. 
342.  ““Corpus delecti” of a crime is established by showing proof of result and 
that some one is criminally responsible therefore.”  State v. Flores, 454 P.2d 
172, 9 Ariz.App. 502. ““Corpus delecti” has as its two elements that a certain 
result has been produced and that some person is criminally responsible for the 
act.”  State v. Wilson, 548 P.2d 23, 113 Ariz. 145. “In Sears, we denied 
standing to citizens seeking relief against the governor because they failed to 
plead and prove palpable injury personal to themselves.”  Bennet v. Napolitano, 
81 P3d 311, 315. “To gain standing to bring an action, a plaintiff must allege a 
distinct and palpable injury.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501.”  Sears v. 
Hull, 961 P.2d 1013, 1017 (1998). “To gain standing to bring an action, a 
plaintiff must allege a distinct and palpable injury.”  Fernandez v. Takata Seat 
Belts, Inc., 108 P.3d 917. Arkansas: “It is a fundamental principal that the 
courts are instituted to afford relief to persons whose rights have been 
invaded…by the defendant’s conduct…a court may and properly should refuse to 
entertain an action at the instance of one whose rights have not been invaded or 
infringed, as where he seeks to invoke a remedy in behalf of another who seeks 
no redress.”  Jag Consulting v. Eubanks, 72 S.W.3d 549 556. “the duty of this 
court, as of every judicial tribunal, is limited to determining rights of 
persons or of property, which are actually controverted in the particular case 
before it.”  Tyler v. Judges of the Court of Registration, 179 U.S. 405, 21 SCt. 
206, 208. California: “In every prosecution for crime it is necessary to 
establish the “corpus delecti”, i.e., the body or elements of the crime.”  
People v. Lopez, 62 Ca.Rptr. 47, 254 C.A.2d 185. “In every criminal trial, the 
prosecution must prove the corpus delecti, or the body of the crime itself-i.e., 
the fact of injury, loss or harm, and the existence of a criminal agency as its 
cause.”  People v. Sapp, 73 P.3d 433, 467 (Cal. 2003) [quoting People v. 
Alvarez, (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1161, 1168-1169, 119 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 46 P.3d 372.]. 
“Elements of “corpus delecti,” injury or loss or harm and a criminal agency 
which causes such injury, loss or harm, need only be proven by a “reasonable 
probability,” i.e., by slight or prima facie proof…”  People v. Ramirez, 153 
Cal.Rptr. 789, 791, 91 C.A. 132. ““Corpus delecti” of crime consists of fact of 
injury, loss, or harm, and existence of criminal agency as cause.”  People v. 
Daly, 10 Cal.Rptr.2d 21, 28, 8 CA4th 47. “Generally, “corpus delecti” of crime 
is (1) the fact of the loss or harm, and (2) the existence of a criminal agency 
as its cause.”  People v. Dorsey, 118 Cal.Rptr. 362, 43 CA3d 953. “There is no 
requirement of independent evidence ‘of every physical act constituting an 
element of an offense,’ so long as there is some slight or prima facie showing 
of injury, loss, or harm by a criminal agency.”  In re I.M., 23 Cal.Rptr.3d 375, 
381 (2005). “The corpus delecti of a crime consists of two elements[:] the fact 
of the injury or loss or harm, and the existence of a criminal agency as its 
cause.”  People v. Jones, 949 P.2d 890, 902, 70 Cal.Rptr.2d 793, 17 Cal.4th 279. 
“The corpus delecti rule requires that the corpus delecti or the body or 
substance of the crime charged be proved independent from the accused’s 
extrajudicial confession or admissions.  The corpus delecti of a crime consists 
of two elements: (1) the fact of the injury or loss or harm, and (2) the 
existence of a criminal agency as its cause. [citing] People v Jennings, 53 Cal

437, 88 SE 21…there must be sufficient proof of both elements of the corpus 
delecti beyond a reasonable doubt.”  29A American Jurisprudence Second Ed., 
Evidence § 1476. “Without standing, there is no actual or justiciable 
controversy, and courts will not entertain such cases.  (3 Witlen, Cal. 
Procedure (3rd ed. 1985) Actions § 44, pp 70-72.)  “Typically, … the standing 
inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint’s allegations to 
ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the 
particular claims asserted.”  (Allen v. Wright, (1984) 468 U.S. 737, 752…Whether 
one has standing in a particular case generally revolved around the question 
whether that person has rights that may suffer some injury, actual or 
threatened.”  Clifford S. v. Superior Court, 45 Cal.Rptr.2d 333, 335. “As a 
general principal, standing to invoke the judicial process requires an actual 
justiciable controversy as to which the complainant has a real interest in the 
ultimate adjudication because he or she has either suffered or is about to 
suffer an injury.”  People v. Superior Court, 126 Cal.Rptr.2d 793. “Judicial 
power generally is the power to adjudicate upon the legal rights of persons and 
property, with reference to transactions or occurrences existing or already had 
and closed…The judicial function is to ‘declare the law and define the rights of 
the parties under it.’  Frasher v. Rader, 124 Cal. 133, 56 P. 797…’A 
determination of the rights of an individual under the existing laws’ is an 
exercise of judicial power…An essential element of judicial power, 
distinguishing it from legislative power, is that it requires ”the ascertainment 
of existing rights.”  People v. Bird, 300 P. 22, 26-27. Colorado: “the corpus 
delecti of a crime minimally requires two elements: “(1) An injury which is 
penally proscribed…and (2) The unlawfulness of some person’s conduct in causing 
that injury.”  People of the State of Colorado v. Smith, 510 P.2d 893, 182 Colo. 
31. “Generally, to subject a person to criminal liability, there must be 
concurrence of the actus reus, an unlawful act, and the mens rea, a culpable 
mental state.”  Gorman v. State, 19 P.3d 662. “The corpus delecti ordinarily 
consists of a penally proscribed injury…and unlawful conduct causing the 
injury.”  People v. Trujillo, 860 P.2d 542, 545. “The corpus delecti, or the 
fact that a crime occurred, must be proved in every case.”  People v. Quinn, 794 
P.2d 1066, 1068. “Properly understood the general principle is sound, for courts 
only adjudicate justiciable controversies… courts must look behind names that 
symbolize the parties to determine whether a justiciable case or controversy is 
presented.”  Friedrichs v. Goldy, 387 P.2d 274, 277 [quoting United States v. 
Interstate Commerce Commission, 337 U.S. 426 (1949]). “The Wimberly standing 
inquiry requires a court to determine “(1) whether the plaintiff was injured in 
fact, [and] (2) whether the injury was to a legally protected right.”  Wimberly, 
194 Colo. at 168…The first prong of the standing test is a constitutional 
requirement since the judicial power granted “by article VI of the Colorado 
constitution may be exercised only if an actual controversy exists, as 
demonstrated by real injury…The second standing requirement, that the injury be 
to a legally protected right…”  Maurer v. Young Life, 779 P.2d 1317. “The 
judicial power of the state shall be vested in a supreme court, district courts, 
a probate court in the city and county of Denver, a juvenile court in the city 
and county of Denver, county courts, and such other courts or judicial officers 
with jurisdiction inferior to the supreme court, as the general assembly may, 
from time to time establish; provided, however, that nothing herein contained 
shall be construed to restrict or diminish the powers of home rule cities and 
towns granted under article XX, section 6 of this constitution to create 
municipal and police courts.”  Colorado constitution, article VI, section 1.
 [Notice there is no distinction regarding criminal and civil jurisdictions, the 
"judicial power" comprehends both criminal and civil and each require a "real 
injury...to a...protected right..."] “Parties have standing if: (1) they have 
suffered an injury in fact; and (2) the harm is to a legally protected 
interest.”  Garhart ex rel. Tinsman v. Columbia/Hathone, LLC., 95 P.3d 571. “A 
plaintiff has standing if he incurred an injury in fact-in-fact to a legally 
protected interest, as comtemplated by statutory or constitutional provisions.”  
Brotman v. East Lake Creek Ranch, LLP., 31 P.3d 886. “the legislature did not 
deprive the courts of judicial power which may be defined as the machinery by 
which persons have their rights determined…”  Denver Local Union No. 13, etc. v. 
Perry Truck Lines , 101 P.2d 436, 447. “the duty of this court, as of every 
judicial tribunal, is limited to determining rights of persons or of property, 
which are actually controverted in the particular case before it.”  Tyler v. 
Judges of the Court of Registration, 179 U.S. 405, 21 SCt. 206, 208.
 Connecticut: ““Corpus delecti” consists of occurrence of specific kind of loss 
or injury embraced in crime charged, rather than commission of crime charged by 
someone.”  State v. Vuilleumer, 210 A.2d 673, 674, 3 Conn.Cir. 223. “Under the 
Wigmore definition, the corpus delecti consists of the occurrence of the 
specific loss or injury embraced in the crime charged.  We adopt this 
definition.”  State v. Tillman, 202 A.2d 494, 496. “Cause of action is that 
single group of facts which is claimed to have brought about unlawful injury to 
plaintiff and which entitles plaintiff to relief.”  Gurliacci v. Mayer, 590 A.2d 
914 (Conn. 1991). “Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in 
motion.  One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he 
[or she] has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in 
the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the 
subject matter of the controversy…”  West Farms Mall, LLC v. West Hartford, 901 
A.2d 649, 655-656 (Conn. 2006). “If a party is found to lack standing, the court 
is without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause…[A] court lacks 
discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without 
jurisdiction…”  Missionary Soc. v. Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, 896 A.2d 809, 
812 (Conn. 2006). “Once the question of subject matter jurisdiction has been 
raised, cognizance of it must be taken and the matter passed upon before [the 
court] can move one further step in the cause…We accordingly address this issue, 
the question is whether the person who standing is challenged is a proper party 
to request an adjudication of the issue…Standing requires no more than a 
colorable claim of injury; a [party] ordinarily establishes standing by 
allegations of injury.”  Wesley v. Schaller Subaru, Inc., 893 A.2d 389, 397 
(Conn. 2006). “If a party is found to lack standing, the court is wihtout 
subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause.”  Cadle Co. v. D’Addario, 
844 A.2d 836. “The general rule is that one party has no standing to raise 
another’s rights.”  Security Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Lumbermens Mut. Ca. Co., 
826 A.2d 107. “A party cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court 
unless he has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest 
in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest inthe 
subject matter of the controversy.  The burden rests with the party who seeks 
the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor to allege facts demonstrating that he 
is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute and, has 
standing.”  Goodyear v. Discala, 849 A.2d 791. Delaware: “Though questioned by 
Wigmore, the prevailing American rule is that proof of the corpus delecti 
requires (1) proof of the injury, death or loss, according to the nature of the 
crime, and (2) proof of criminal means as the cause.  7 Wigmore on Evidence, 
[section] 2072.  This is the rule in Delaware.”  Nelson v. State, 123 A.2d 859, 
861. “In criminal prosecutions, the State need only show a “but for” 
relationship between an action and a result to establish causation.”  Bolluck v. 
State, 775 A.2d 1043, 1049 (2001. “The party invoking the jurisdiction of a 
court bears the burden of establishing the elements of standing. The degree and 
manner of evidence that is required to establish standing varies as the 
successive of any litigation proceeds.  At the pleading stage, general 
allegations of injury are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss…When a 
motion for summary judgment is filed however, the plaintiff can no longer rest 
on such “mere allegations.” … The term “standing” refers to the right of a party 
to invoke the jurisdiction of a court to enforce a claim or to redress a 
grievance.  Standing is a threshold question that must be answered by a court 
affirmatively to ensure that the litigation before the tribunal is a “case or 
controversy” that is appropriate for the exercise of the court’s judicial 
powers.  The issue of standing is concerned “only with the question of who is 
entitled to mount a legal challenge and not with the merits of the subject 
matter in controversy.”  To establish standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate 
first, that he or she sustained an “injury-in-fact”; and second, that the 
interests he or she seeks to be protected are within the zone of interests to be 
protected.”  Dover Hist. Soc. v. Dover Planning Com’n., 838 A.2d 1103, 1109-1110 
( Del.2003). Florida: “Causation consists of two distinct subelements.  As legal 
scholars have recognized, before a defendant can be convicted of a crime that 
includes an element of causation, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
that the defendant’s conduct was (1) the “cause in fact” and (2) the “legal 
cause” (often called “proximate cause”) of the relevant harm…In order to 
establish that a defendant’s conduct was the “cause in fact” of a particular 
harm, the State usually must demonstrate that “but for” the defendant’s conduct, 
the harm would not have occurred.”  Eversly v. State, 748 So.2d 963, 966-967 
(Fla. 1999). “”A Cause of action is some particular legal right of plaintiff 
against defendant, together with some definite violation thereof which occasions 
loss or damage.”  Luckie v. McCall Manufacturing Co., 152 So.2d 311, 314…”  
Soowal v. Marden, 452 So.2d 625, 626. “It is a fundamental principle of law that 
no person be adjudged guilty of a crime until the state has shown that a crime 
has been committed.  The state therefore must show that a harm has been suffered 
of the type contemplated by the charges (for example, a death in the case of a 
murder charge or a loss of property in the case of a theft charge), and that 
such harm was incurred due to the criminal agency of another.  Thus, it is 
sufficient if the elements of the underlying crime are proven rather than those 
of the particular degree or variation of that crime which may be charged.”  
State v. Allen, 335 So. 2d 823,825 (Fla. 1976). “A party has standing when he or 
she has a sufficient stake in a justiciable controversy.  Sierra Club v. Morton, 
405 U.S. 727, 731…To establish standing it must be shown that the party suffered 
injury in fact (economic or otherwise) for which relief is likely to be 
addressed.  See Warth v. Seldin , 422 U.S. 490, 501…it may not be abstract, 
conjectural or hypothetical.  Allen v. Wright , 468 U.S. 737, 791…”  Peregard v. 
Cosmides, 663 So.2d 665, 668. “A litigant must assert his or her own legal 
rights and interests, and cannot rest claim to relief on the legal rights or 
interests of third paries.”  Alterra Healthcare Corp. v. Estate of Shelley, 827 
So.2d 936. “Generally, to have standing to bring an action the plaintiff must 
allege that he has suffered or will suffer a special injury.”  Alachua County v. 
Scharps, 855 So.2d 195. Georgia: “In defining ‘corpus delecti’ Wharton says: ‘It 
is made up of two elements: (1) That a certain result has been produced…(2) That 
some one is criminally responsible for the result…”  McVeigh v. State, 53 S.E.2d 
462, 469. “A cause of action is some particular right of the plaintiff against 
the defendant, together with some definite violation of that right which 
occasions damage, whether the right arises by contract or tort.  Ellison v. Ga. 
R. Co., 87 Ga. 691, 13 S.E. 809 (1891); City of Columbus v. Anglin. 120 Ga. 
785(4), 48 S.E. 318 (1904).  It may also be defined from the standpoint of 
duties, provided the complainant has proven a duty owed by the defendant to him, 
and a breach of that duty shown which results in loss to the complainant. 
Ellison v. Ga. R. Co., supra.  There can be no right of action until there has 
been a wrong, that is, a violation of a legal right or breach of a legal duty…”  
Bryant v. Randall, 261 S.E.2d 602, 605-606. “Particular remedy is not available 
to party who has no entitlement to right sought to be secured.”  Ragsdale v. New 
England Land and Development Corp., 297 S.E.2d 31. “Standing deals with question 
of whether party may assert right even presuming it exists.”  Nationwide Mortg. 
Resources, Inc. v. Stalzer, 455 S.E.2d 402. Hawaii: “In order to prove that a 
crime occurred, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the basic 
injury …, (2) the fact that the basic injury was the result of a criminal, 
rather than a natural or accidental cause…”  State v. Libero, 83 P.3d 753, 763 
(2003), [quoting State v. Dudoit, 55 Haw. 1, 2, 514 P.2d 373, 374 (1973)]. 
““Corpus delecti” of any particular crime means actual commission of crime by 
someone and it made up of two elements; that is, certain result has been 
produced and some person is criminally responsible for the act.”  State v. Hale, 
367 P.2d 81, 85, 45 Haw. 269. “Plaintiff without standing is not entitled to 
invoke a court’s jurisdiction.”  Mottle v. Miyahira, 23 P.3d 716. “Petitioner 
must satisfy all three prongs of the three-part “injury-in-fact” test to 
establish its standing.”  Sierra Club v. Hawai’I Tourism Authority ex rel Board 
of Directors, 59 P.3d 877.  Idaho: “To prove a crime generally, the state must 
provide evidence of three broad elements: (1) that an injury occurred; (2) that 
criminal agency was involved in causing the injury; and (3) the identity of the 
person who caused the injury…Historically, under the standard formulations of 
the corpus delicti principle, the state was required to show the “body” of a

Idaho 635, 778 P.2d 757 (1989), the court stated three basic propositions 
concerning standing that guide our decision here: 1. “The doctrine of standing 
focuses on the party seeking relief and not on the issues the party wishes to 
have adjudicated.” 2. “[T]o satisfy the case or controversy requirement of 
standing, litigants generally must allege or demonstrate an injury in fact and a 
substantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested will prevent or 
redress the claimed injury.”  Boundary Backpackers v. Boundary County, 913 P.2d 
1141, 1145. “Person wishing to invoke a court’s jurisdiction must have 
standing…Doctrine of standing focuses on the party seeking relief and not on the 
issues the party wishes to have adjudicated…To satisfy the requirement of 
standing, the petitioners must allege or demonstrate an injury in fact and a 
substantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested will prevent or 
redress the claimed injury.”  Schneider v. Howe, 133 P.3d 1232. “The issue of 
standing is jurisdictional and may be raised at any time.”  Beach lateral Water 
Users Ass’n v. Harrison, 130 P.3d 1138. “The doctrine of standing focuses on the 
party seeking relief and not the issues the party wishes to have adjudicated.”  
Troutner v. Kempthorn, 128 P.3d 926. “Standing is a fundamental prerequisite to 
invoking a court’s jurisdiction.”  Noh v. Cenarrusa, 53 P.3d 1217. Illinois: 
“Occurrence of injury or loss, and its causation by criminal conduct, are termed 
the “corpus delecti.”  People v. Assenato, 586 N.E.2d 445, 448, 166 Ill.Dec. 
487, 490. ““Corpus delecti” of an offence consists of fact that injury occurred 
and fact that injury was caused by a criminal act.”  People v. Lewis, 498 N.E.2d 
1169, 1174, 101 Ill.Dec. 661, 666. “It is elementary that the corpus delecti 
constitutes an essential element of a criminal prosecution…”  People v. O’Neil, 
165 N.E.2d 319, 320. “Rather, we understand the rule to be that the corpus 
delecti, like every essential element of a criminal case, must be proved by 
competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.”  People v. Jones , 177 N.E.2d 
112, 114. “The corpus delecti rule requires that the corpus delecti or the body

Evidence § 1476. “In Illinois, standing requires only some injury in fact to a 
legally cognizable interest and the injury, whether actual or threatened, must 
be distinct and palpable, fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions, and 
substantially likely to be prevented or redressed by the…relief requested.”  In 
re D.W., 799 N.E.2d 410. “Standing requries only some injury in fact to a 
legally cognizable interest.”   In re County Treasurer and Ex Officio County 
Collector of Cook County, 775 N.E.2d 86. “This court has repeatedly held that 
standing requires some injury in fact to a legally recognized interest.”  In re 
Estate of Wellman, 673 N.E.2d 272, 276 (Ill. 1996). “The definition of judicial 
power given by Judge Cooley in his work on Constiutional Limitations, held by 
this court to be sufficiently accurate  for the purposes of the question then 
before the court, which was in substance the same as that now under 
consideration, is as follows: “The power which adjudicates upon and protects the 
rights and interests of individual citizens, and to that end construes and 
applies the laws.”  Owners of Lands v. People, 113 Ill. 309.”  People v. Chase, 
46 N.E. 454, 458.  Also quoted in People v. Bruner, 175 N.E. 400, 404 “”Judicial 
power” implies the construction of laws and the adjudication of legal 
rights…[note 6] No law is construed by the board, and no legal rights are 
submitted to and adjudicated by it, without which, we have seen, judicial power 
is not exercised.”   People v. Appelbaum, 95 N.E. 995, 997. “Judicial power is 
the power which adjudicates upon the rights of citizens, and to that end 
construes and applies the law.”  People v. Hawkinson, 155 N.E. 318, 319.
 Indiana: “Corpus delecti consists of a showing of “1) the occurrence of the 
specific kind of injury and 2) someone’s criminal act as the cause of the 
injury.”"  Johnson v. State, 653 N.E.2d 478, 479 (Ind. 1995). “State must 
produce corroborating evidence of “corpus delecti,” showing that injury or harm 
constituting crime occurred and that injury or harm was caused by someone’s 
criminal activity.”  Jorgensen v. State, 567 N.E.2d 113, 121. “To establish the 
corpus delecti, independent evidence must be presented showing the occurrence of 
a specific kind of injury and that a criminal act was the cause of the injury.”  
Porter v. State, 391 N.E.2d 801, 808-809. “The corpus delecti rule requires that 
the corpus delecti or the body or substance of the crime charged be proved 
independent from the accused’s extrajudicial confession or admissions.  The 
corpus delecti of a crime consists of two elements: (1) the fact of the injury

sufficient proof of both elements of the corpus delecti beyond a reasonable 
doubt.”  29A American Jurisprudence Second Ed., Evidence § 1476. “The 
distinction between torts and crimes is based upon the public nature of the 
criminal offense.  “Although the same act may constitute both a crime and a 
tort, the crime is an offense against the public pursued by the sovereign, while 
the tort is a private injury which is pursued by the injured party.”  14 Am.Jur. 
755, [section] 3.  The same distinction has been noted by another authority in 
the following language:  “The real distinction between a tort and a crime is to 
be sought for, not in a difference between their tendencies, but in the 
difference between the methods by which the remedy for the wrong is pursued, a 
wrong for which the remedy is pursued by and at the discretion of the individual 
injured or his representative being a tort, and a wrong for which the wrongdoer 
is proceeded against by the sovereign or state for the purpose of punishment 
being a crime.”  State v. White Circuit Court, 77 N.E.2d 298, 300-301. “Standing 
is a fundamental, threshold, constitutional issue that must be addressed by 
this, or any, court to determine if it should exercise jurisdiction in the 
particular case before it.  The issue of standing focuses on whether the 
complaining party is the proper one to invoke the court’s power.  Scott v. 
Randell, 736 N.E.2d 308 (Ind.Ct.App.2000)…To establish standing, therefore, a 
plaintiff must demonstrate a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit and 
that the injury is a result of the defendant’s conduct [citation omitted].  If 
properly challenged, when a plaintiff fails to establish standing in the 
pleadings, the court must dismiss the complaint.  Shulz v. State, 731 N.E.2d 
1041.  Moreover: Although the Indiana constitution contains no “case or 
controversy” requirement, the federal limits on justiciability are instructing 
because the standing requirement under both federal and state constitutional law 
fulfills the same purpose; ensuring that the litigant is entitled to have the 
court decide the merits of the dispute or of the particular issues.  Id. at 
1044.  Under the federal test, to establish standing a plaintiff must allege a 
personal injury that is fairly traceable to the defendant’s allegedly unlawful 
conduct and is likely to be redressed by the requested relief.  Id. citing Allen 
v. Wright, 768 U.S. 737…”  Alexander v. PSB Lending Corp, 800 N.E.2d 984, 989. 
“Under the general rule of standing, only those persons who have a personal 
stake in the outcome of the litigation and who show that they have suffered or 
were in immediate danger of suffering a direct injury as a result of the 
complained-of conduct will be found to have standing; absent this showing, 
complainants may not invoke the jurisdiction of the court.”  State ex rel 
Citidine v. Indiana Dept. of Trans.,790 N.E.2d 978. Iowa: While the corpus 
delecti must be proved beyond all reasonable doubt, yet it may be established by 
circumstantial as well as direct evidence.  State v. Wescott, 104 N.W. 341, 130 
Iowa 1; State v. Kelly, 186 N.W. 834, 193 Iowa 62. “The principals of causation 
normally associated with civil tort litigation are pertinent in criminal cases.  
State v. Murray, 512 N.W.2d 547, 550 (Iowa 1994).”  State v. Garcia , 616 N.W.2d 
594, 596 (Iowa 2000). “In order for there to be a “right of action” or “cause of 
action,” there must be a legal right in plaintiff corresponding duty on part of 
the defendant and attendant breach of that duty with resultant harm to 
plaintiff…”  Giltner v. Stark, 252 N.W.2d 743. “To have standing, complaining 
party must have specific, personal, and legal interest in the litigation and be 
injuriously affected.”  In re Marriage of Mitchell, 531 N.W.2d 132. “one should 
bear in mind the fundamental principal that courts are instituted to afford 
relief to persons whose rights have been invaded, or are threatened with 
invasion by the defendant’s act or conduct…”  Bowers v. Bailey, 21 N.W.2d 773, 
776. “Corpus delecti is made up of two element: (1) a result has been 
produced…(2) some one is criminally responsible for the result.”  State v. 
Stamper, 195 N.W.2d 110, 112-113. “In our opinion, the term [corpus delecti] 
means, when applied to any particular offense, that the particular crime charged 
has actually been committed by some one.  It is made up of two elements: First, 
that a certain result has been produced…second, that some one is criminally 
responsible for the result.”  State v. Whisler, 3 N.W.2d 525, 528. Kansas: “We 
first note that standing is a jurisdictional issue in Kansas…As a result, 
standing is not waivable.”  Midcontinental Specialists v. Capital Homes, 106 
P.3d 483. “Standing is a question of whether the plaintiff has alleged such a 
personal stake in he outcome of a controversy as to warrant invocation of 
jurisdiction and to justify  exercise of the courts’ remedial powers on his 
behalf…The party must have personally suffered some injury and there must be a 
causal connection between the injury and the challenged conduct.”  Moorhouse v. 
City of Wichta, 913 P.2d 172, 176. “Generally, “standing” requires that a 
plaintiff have a personal interest in the court’s decision, and that he or she 
personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of a 
putatively illegal conduct of the defendant.”  Lower v. Bd. of Directors of 
Haskell County Cemetary Dist., 56 P.3d 235. “Standing is a jurisdictional 
issue.”  Nichols v. Kansas Governmental Ethics Com’n., 18 P.3d 270. “It is the 
primary duty of the courts to safeguard the declaration of right and remedy 
guaranteed by the constitutional provision insuring a remedy for all injuries.”  
Noel v. Menninger Foundation, 267 P.2d 934, 943. Kentucky: “Before a party can 
have a controversy judicially determined, he must have an interest in the 
subject matter…Generally, a defect in parties or objections based upon the 
absence of a legal right to maintain an action should be raised by a demurrer, 
plea in abatement or in bar.”  Thompson-Starrett Co. v. Mason’s Adm’rs., 201 
S.W.2d 786, 883. Louisiana: All government, of right, originates with the 
people, is founded on their will alone, and is instituted to protect the rights 
of the individual and for the good of the whole. Its only legitimate ends are to 
secure justice for all, preserve peace, protect the rights, and promote the 
happiness and general welfare of the people. The rights enumerated in this 
Article are inalienable by the state and shall be preserved inviolate by the 
state. “  Article I § 1, Louisiana constitution. ““Corpus delecti,” the body or 
substance of a crime, is composed of two elements: occurrence of an unlawful 
injury, and illegal conduct causing that injury.”  State v. Outlaw, 485 So.2d 
217, 221. “Corpus delecti, the body or substance of a crime, has two elements: 
(1) an unlawful injury has occurred; and (2) some person’s illegal conduct 
caused that injury.”  State v. Reed, 420 So.2d 950, 951. Maine: “The United 
States Supreme Court as stated that standing requires one who as suffered an 
injury to show that the injury in fact is fairly traceable to the challenged 
action and that such injury is likely to be redressed by the judicial relief 
sought.   Allen v. Wright , 468 U.S. 737…We have previously held that to have 
standing a litigant must have suffered a particularized injury that is distinct 
from the harm suffered by the public at large…We have construed particularized 
injury as an injury resulting from an action adversely and directly affecting 
the party’s property, pecuniary or personal rights.  New England Herald Dev. 
Group v. Town of Falmouth, 521 A.2d 693, 695 (Me. 1987).”  Proctor v. County of 
Penobscot, 651 A.2d 355, 357. You’ll notice that the attorney for the County 
wrote: a plaintiff “generally must assert his own legal rights and interest and 
cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interest of third 
parties.”  Also at page 357. “The requirement for standing that a party suffer 
an injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged action is met when a 
defendant’s actions have adversely affected and directly affected the party’s 
property, pecuniary or personal rights.”  Collins v. State, 750 A.2d 1257, 1260.
 Maryland: “While the corpus delecti must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt…it 
may be established by circumstantial evidence…”  James v. State, 248 A.2d 910, 
912. “Properly understood the general principle is sound, for courts only 
adjudicate justiciable controversies… courts must look behind names that 
symbolize the parties to determine whether a justiciable case or controversy is 
presented.”  Blind Industries v. D.G.S., 808 A.2d 782, 784 (Md. 2002) [quoting 
United States v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 337 U.S. 426 (1949)]. “We have 
said clearly that, to determine when a cause of action accrues under the LGTCA 
notice provision, we “must examine the elements of the cause of action”—for, 
under our precedents, “a cause of action is said to have arisen when facts exist 
to support each element,” including injury. Heron, 361 Md. at 264, 761 A.2d at 
59.”  Prince George’s Cnt, Maryland, et al. v. Keith Longtin, 
http://caselaw.findlaw.com/md-court-of-appeals/1564702.html  “In Adamson v. 
Corr. Med. Servs., 359 Md. 238, 753 A.2d 501 (2000), this Court stated: In 
reviewing the underlying grant of a motion to dismiss, we must assume the truth 
of the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, including the 
reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those allegations. We have noted 
that “the facts comprising the cause of action must be pleaded with sufficient 
specificity. Bald assertions and conclusory statements by the pleader will not 
suffice.” Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Maryland INC v. Gasper 
http://caselaw.findlaw.com/md-court-of-appeals/1560264.html  Massachusetts: “The 
end of the institution, maintenance, and administration of government is to 
secure the existence of the body-politic, to protect it, and to furnish the 
individuals who compose it with the power of enjoying, in safety and 
tranquillity, their natural rights and the blessings of life…”  Preamble, 
Massachusetts Constitution 1780, still in current constitution . “Criminal 
responsibility is imposed on the basis of the intentional doing of an act with 
awareness of the probability that the act will result in substantial damage, 
regardless of whether the injury turns out to be minor or insignificant.”  Com. 
v. Ruddock, 520 N.E.2d 501. “The issue of standing may be raised at any time.”  
In re Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare, Inc., 746 N.E.2d 513. “To have standing in any 
capacity, a litigant must show that the challenged action has caused litigant 
injury.”  Perella v. Massachusetts Turpike Auth., 772 N.E.2d 70. “Courts are not 
established to enable parties to litigate in which they have no interest 
affecting their liberty, rights or property.”  Razin v. Razin, 124 N.E.2d 269, 
270. Michigan: “Lack of license to carry a concealed weapon established that 
crime had been committed and therefore was part of the “corpus delecti.”  People 
v. Autry, 152 N.W.2d 55, 56, 7 Mich.App.480. ““Corpus delecti” includes fact of 
specific loss or injury and someone’s criminality.”  People v. Randall, 201 
N.W.2d 292, 293, 42 Mich.App. 187. ““Corpus delecti,” meaning body or substance 
of crime charged, involves two elements: injury which is penally proscribed and 
unlawfulness of some person’s conduct in causing injury.”  People v. Swift , 470 
N.W.2d 491, 492, 188 Mich.App. 619. “For there to be criminal responsibility, 
defendant’s acts must have caused harm.”  People v. Zak, 457 N.W.2d 59. “The

“Although the same act may constitute both a crime and a tort, the crime is an

 Mississippi: “The Latin words “corpus delecti” mean literally, “the body of the 
crime”.  In order to prove the corpus delecti, there are two elements which must 
be proved beyond a reasonable doubt:  One, the existence of a certain act or 
result forming the basis of that criminal charge; and, two, the existence of 
criminal agency as the cause of this act or result…It is a well-settled 
principal of criminal law that a conviction for crime cannot be had unless the 
corpus delecti-that is, the fact that a crime has actually been perpetrated (the 
fact of injury or harm and the existence of some person criminally responsible 
therefore)-is first established by the prosecution.  In other words, the 
prosecution must establish the actual commission, by someone, of the particular 
offense charged.  The accused is not required in any case to answer a charge 
against him in the absence of evidence upon the part of the prosecution 
sufficient to establish the corpus delecti; and if an accused is found guilty 
despite the failure of the prosecution to establish the corpus delecti, the 
verdict may be set aside and a new trial ordered…the reason the state is 
requried to prove the corpus delecti is to satisfy the mind that there is a real 
and not an imaginary crime for which the accused stands charged.”  Kirtkland v. 
State, 371 So.2d 402, 404. “It [corpus delecti] has two elements which must be 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to show that a crime has actually been 
committed [citations omitted].  First, it is necessary to prove the existence of 
a certain act or result forming the basis of the criminal charge…Moreover, the 
State must prove the existence of criminal agency as the cause of this act or 
result…However, “[e]very element, criminal charge, and criminal agency myst be 
proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”"  Parks v. State, 884 So.2d 738, 743 (Miss. 
2004). “The United States Supreme Court has stated the concept of standing 
generally embraces “the general prohibition on a litigant raising another 
person’s legal rights…”  Mount v. Mount, 624 So2d. 997, 1001. “A suit cannot be 
maintained where it appears from the declaration itself the right of action is 
not in the party suing, but in another.”  Haynes v. Ezell, 25 Miss. (3 Cushm.) 
242. Missouri: “To prove guilt of any crime, State must first demonstrate the 
crime’s corpus delecti, or body of crime, consisting of two elements – that loss 
or injury charged has occurred and that someone’s criminal agency caused loss or 
injury.”  State v. Davis, 797 S.W.2d 560. “”Corpus delecti” consists of proof, 
direct or circumstantial, the specific loss or injury occurred and criminal 
behavior by someone as cause of loss or injury.”  State v. Frentzel, 730 S.W.2d 
554. “The corpus delecti rule requires that the corpus delecti or the body or 
substance of the crime charged be proved independent from the accused’s 
extrajudicial confession or admissions.  The corpus delecti of a crime consists 
of two elements: (1) the fact of the injury or loss or harm, and (2) the

criminality is cause of loss or injury; proof need not include proof of 
defendant’s connection with crime charged.”  State v. Friesen, 725 SW2d 638,

Questions, 89 S.W.3d 460. “A party seeking relief must have a legally cognizable 
interest in the subject matter and a threatened or actual injury to have 
standing.”  Meyer v. Meyer, 77 S.W.3d 40. “A party is “injured” for purposes of

“Regardless of the action’s merits, unless the parties to the action have proper 
standing, a court may not entertain the action…Standing requires that a party 
seeking relief have a legally cognizable interest in the subject matter and that 
he has a threatened or actual injury.”  E. Mo. Laborers D. Coun. v. St. Louis 
Cty., 781 S.W.2d 43, 45-46 (Mo.banc 1989). Montana: “Generally speaking, the 
term “corpus delecti,” when applied to any particular offense, means that the 
specific crime charged has actually been committed by some one, and it is made 
up of two elements: First, that a certain result has been produced…second, that 
some one is criminally responsible for the result…”State v. Kindle, 227 P. 65, 
67. “We have previously stated that the following criteria must be satisfied to 
establish standing: (1) The complaining party must clearly allege past, present 
or threatened injury to a property or civil right; and (2) the alleged injury 
must be distinguishable from the injury to the public generally, but the injury 
need not be exclusive to the complaining party.”  Gryczan v. State, 942 P.2d 
112, 118. “Standing is a threshold requirement of every case.”  Palmer v. Bahm, 
128 P.3d 1031. “‘Standing’ is a person’s right to make a legal claim or seek 
judicial enforcement of a duty or right.”  In re Parenting of D.A.H., 109 P.3d 
247. “Standing is part of the larger question whether a controversy is 
justiciable.” Stroebe v. State, 127 P.3d 1051. “It is axiomatic and this court 
has consistently held that the existence of a justiciable controversy is a 
threshold requirement in order for a court to grant relief…To maintain an action 
the plaintiff must show that he has a right to be enforced or a wrong to be 
prevented or redressed…but he is is without standing where it is not shown that 
his rights have been, or are about to be, invaded.”  Powder River County v. 
State, 60 P.3d 357, 379 (Mont. 2002). “Standing to sue refers to a “party’s 
right to make a legal claim or seek judicial enforcement of a duty or right…A 
threshold requirement of every case is that a party have standing to bring the 
action…The mere fact that a person is entitled to bring an action under a given 
statute is insufficient to establish standing; the party must allege some past, 
present, or threatened injury which would be alleviated by successfully 
maintaining the action…Since the general rule is that ‘a litigant may only 
assert his own constitutional rights or immunities…’”  In re B.F., 87 P.3d 427, 
430-431. Nebraska: “To sustain a conviction, the corpus delecti must be proved 
beyond a reasonable doubt.”  State v. George, 424 N.W.2d 350, 351. The corpus 
delecti must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  Chezem v, State, 76 N.W. 
1056, 56 Neb. 496; McCue v. State, 198 N.W. 163, 112 Neb. 9 “To establish

equitable right, title or interest in the subject of the controversy.”  Douglas 
County Bd. of Com’rs v. Civil Service Com’n, Douglas County, 641 N.W.2d 55. “In 
order to have standing, a litigant must assert the litigant’s own legal rights 
and interests and cannot rest his or her claim on the legal rights or interests 
of third parties…”  Adam v. City of Hastings, 676 N.W.2d 710. “Standing is the 
legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject of the 
controversy…Standing relates to the court’s power, that is, jurisdiction, to 
address the issues presented and serves to indentify those disputes which are 
appropriately resolved through the judicial process…Standing is a jurisdictional 
component of a party’s case because only a party who has standing may invoke the 
jurisdiction of a court…The purpose of an inquiry as to standing is to determine 
whether one has a legally protectable interest or right in the controversy…In 
order to have standing, a litigant must assert the litigant’s own legal rights 
and interests and cannot rest his or her claim on the legal rights or interests 
of third parties.”  County of Sarpy v. City of Gretna, 678 N.W.2d 740 (Neb. 
2004). “A cause of action is judicial protection of one’s recognized right or 
interest, when another, owing a corresponding duty not to invade or violate such 
right or interest, has caused a breach of that duty.”  Millman v. County of 
Butler, 458 N.W.2d 207, 214. “generally judicial power is the authority to hear 
and determine a controversy as to rights and upon such determination to render a 
judgment binding upon the disputants.”  Laverty v. Cochran, 271 N.W. 354, 357.
 New Hampshire: “To establish causation, the State needed to prove not only that 
the prohibited result would not have occurred but for the conduct of the 
defendant, but also that the defendant’s conduct was the legal (or proximate) 
cause of the prohibited result.”  State v. Lamprey, 821 A.2d 1080, 1082 (N.H. 
2003) “In evaluating whether a party has standing to sue, we focus on whether 
the plaintiff suffered a legal injury against which the law was designed to 
protect.”  Roberts v. General Motors Corp., 643 A.2d 956, 958 (N.H. 1994). “In 
evaluating whether a party has standing to sue, we focus on whether the 
plaintiff suffered a legal injury against which the law was designed to 
protect…Here, the plaintiffs suffered no injury…They therefore lack standing…”  
Malnati v. State, 803 A.2d 587, 590 (N.H. 2002). “the duty of this court, as of 
every judicial tribunal, is limited to determining rights of persons or of 
property, which are actually controverted in the particular case before it.”  
Tyler v. Judges of the Court of Registration, 179 U.S. 405, 21 SCt. 206, 208.
 New Jersey: The term “corpus delecti” embraces occurrence of loss or injury and 
criminal causation thereof.”  State v. Hill, 221 A.2d 725, 728, 47 N.J. 490.

delecti beyond a reasonable doubt.”  29A American Jurisprudence Second Ed., 
Evidence § 1476. “Proof of the corpus delecti – the fact of injury or, in a 
homicide case, of death, by a criminal agency – may be supplied by direct or 
circumstantial evidence.  State v. Zarinsky, 362 A.2d 611, 621. “Proof of the 
corpus delecti is required in all criminal cases…There are three basic elements 
in the proof of a crime: (1) the occurrence of loss or injury, (2) criminal 
causation of that loss or injury and (3) the identity of the defendant as the 
perpetrator of the crime.  However, it is firmly established in this State that 
the term corpus delecti embraces only the first two of these elements-loss or 
injury and criminal causation.”  State v. Hill, 221 A.2d 725, 728. “It is true 
that the above care all cases of felonious homicide, but the doctrine [of corpus 
delecti] is in nowise peculiar to such cases; it is equally applicable to all 
criminal cases.”  State v. Gelzeiler , 128 A. 240. “Standing in no way depends 
on the merits of the plaintiff’s contention that particular conduct is illegal.” 
 Watkins v. Resorts Intern. Hotel &amp; Casino, 591 A.2d 592, 601 (N.J. 1991). 
“Normally, an individual will only be permitted to seek judicial vindication of 
his own rights.”  State v. Norflett, 337 A.2d 609. “Standing requires only a 
substantial likelihood of some harm visited upon the plaintiff in the event of 
an unfavorable decision.” In re Camden County, 790 A.2d 158. New Mexico: 
“‘Standing’ is a doctrine requiring that the claimant must have a personal stake 
in the outcome of the case; the claimant must allege both injury in fact and a 
traceable causal connection between the claimed injury and the challenged 
conduct.  Dona Ana County Clerk v. Martinez, 124 P.3d 210. “Standing requires 
injury in fact, causation, and likelihood of redress.”  Williams v. Stewart, 112 
P.3d 281. “Lack of standing is a potential jurisdictional defect, which may not 
be waived and may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, even sua sponte by 
the appellate court.”  Gunaji v. Macias, 31 P.3d 1008. New York: “We hold these 
truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed 
by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are, life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments 
are instituted among men”  New York constitution, April 20, 1777. “A crime is an 
inexcusable act committed by an individual in excess of his personal liberties 
and injures person or property within the victim’s personal freedom or property 
right.” “What is liberty or freedom?” “This freedom and liberty of man should be 
absolute with the one exception-that when the exercise of that liberty infringes 
upon the liberty of another, the actor invading another’s liberty commits a 
wrong and to protect individuals from that invasion, society may class such 
invasion as crime, and provide for punishment.”  People v. Douglas, 202 N.Y.S.2d 
160, 162-163. “Mere legislataive fiat may not take the place of fact in the 
determination of issues involving life, liberty and property.  Manley v. State 
of Georgia, 279 U.S. 1, 49 S.Ct. 215, 73 L.Ed. 575…The ultimate fact to be 
established here, is illegal possession of a gun.  The fact proven would be 
merely the legislative presumption.  There would be no actual proof…Under our 
law the corpus delecti must be proved; here it is presumed…The Legislature has 
no power to declare one guilty of a crime; that is the function of the court 
after due proof.  It is unconstitutional for the Legislature to presume the 
guilt of the accused.  Under this section there is nothing against which to 
defend, because no crime has been proved.”  People v. Pinder, 9 N.Y.S.2d 311, 
310-311. “The jurisdiction of this Court extends only to live controversies (see 
Matter of Grand Jury Subpoenas for Locals 17, 135, 257 &amp; 608, 72 N.Y.2d 307, 
311, 532 N.Y.S.2d 722, 528 N.E.2d 1195 [1988]; ?Matter of Hearst Corp. v. Clyne, 
50 N.Y.2d 707, 713-714, 431 N.Y.S.2d 400, 409 N.E.2d 876 [1980]?).” “Standing to 
sue is critical to the proper functioning of the judicial system.   It is a 
threshold issue.   If standing is denied, the pathway to the courthouse is 
blocked.   The plaintiff who has standing, however, may cross the threshold and 
seek judicial redress. It is difficult to draw an exquisitely sharp line 
separating the worthy litigant from one who would generate a lawsuit to advance 
someone else’s cause.   The rules governing standing help courts separate the 
tangible from the abstract or speculative injury, and the genuinely aggrieved 
from the judicial dilettante or amorphous claimant. “For generations, New York 
courts have treated standing as a common-law concept, requiring that the 
litigant have something truly at stake in a genuine controversy.”  Saratoga 
County Chamber of Commerce v. Pataki (2003) “An analysis of standing begins with 
a determination of whether the party seeking relief has sustained an injury (see 
Society of Plastics Indus. v. County of Suffolk, 77 N.Y.2d 761, 772-773, 570 
N.Y.S.2d 778, 573 N.E.2d 1043 [1991]).”  Mahoney v. Pataki, 772 N.E.2d 1118, 
1122 (N.Y. 2002). “A plaintiff has standing to maintain an action upon alleging 
an injury in fact that falls within his or her zone of interest.”  Silver v. 
Pataki, 755 N.E.2d 842, 847 (N.Y. 2001). “As we have has on occasion to observe 
in recent years, “[o]nly where there is a clear legislative intent negating 
review * * * or lack of injury in fact * * * will standing be denied…”  Matter 
of Dist. Atty. of Suffolk County, 448 N.E.2d 440, 443 (N.Y. 1983). “To 
adjudicate upon, and protect the rights and interests of individual citizens, 
and to that end to construe and apply the laws, is the peculiar province of the 
judicial department…The judicial power “is the power to hear and determine those 
matters which affect the life, liberty, or property of the citizens of the 
state.”  (City of Sapulpa v. Land, 101 Okl. 22, 223 P. 640, 644, 35 A.L.R. 872, 
878.)”  Nash v. Brooks, 297 N.Y.S. 853, 855-856.  Nevada: “To establish 
standing, Kirkpatrick must show that he suffered an injury in fact, that there 
is a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, and 
that it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable 
decision.[Footnote] Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 731, 751…See also Elley v. 
Stephens, 104 Nev. 413, 416, 760 P.2d 768, 770 (1998).”  Kirkpatrick v.Dist. 
Ct., 43 P.3d 998, 1005 (Nev. 2002). North Dakota: “To have standing to bring 
action, plaintiff must have suffered some threatened or actual injury resulting 
from putatively illegal action, asserted harm must not be specialized grievances 
shared by all or large class of citizens.”  Trinity Medical Center v. North 
Dakota Bd. of Nursing, 399 N.W.2d 835. “And a definition which we consider 
appropriate and fully sustained is that judicial power is authority vested in 
some court, officer, or person to hear and determine when the rights of persons 
or property, or the propriety of doing an act, are the subject-matter of 
adjudication.”  State v. Blaisdell, 132 N.W. 769, 773. North Carolina: 
“constitutionally, a plaintiff can only have standing if it satisfies the “case 
or controversy” requirement of Article III of the Constitution of the United 
States.  See Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 US 614, 617…Under Supreme Court 
precedent, a plaintiff satisfies the Article III requirement if it meets a 
three-pronged test: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered “injury in fact’; (2) 
there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained 
of; and (3) it must be likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable 
decision.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559…The plaintiff 
bears the burden of establishing these three elements.  See Burten v. Central 
Interstate URWC Comm’n., 23 F3d 208, 209 (8th Cir. 1994).  Additionally, the 
Supreme Court as articulated three prudential limits on standing…lastly, the 
plaintiff must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his 
claim on the legal rights of others [citing Valley Forge v. Americans United, 
454 US 464, 474].  Transco v. Calco Enterprises, 511 S.E.2d 671, 678. “A “person 
aggrieved” for standing purposes, is one adversly affected in respect to legal 
rights, or suffering from an infringement or denial of legal rights.”  County of 
Johnston v. City of Wilson , 525 S.E.2d 425. “Standing is an aspect of subject 
matter jurisdiction.”  Transcontinental Gas Line Corp. v. Calco Enterprises, 511 
S.E.2d 671. “Plaintiffs have the burden of establishing standing…If a party does 
not have standing to bring a claim, a court has no subject matter jurisdiction 
to hear the claim.”  Munger v. State Ill., No. COA09-375. Ohio: “The corpus 
delecti rule requires that the corpus delecti or the body or substance of the 
crime charged be proved independent from the accused’s extrajudicial confession

criminally prohibited injury and a criminally prohibited act as its cause.”  
Fontenot v. State, 881 P.2d 69, 77 (Okl.Cr. 1994). “”Corpus delecti” means body

“The judicial power here conferred by the Constitution is the power to hear and 
determine those matters which affect the life, liberty, or property of the 
citizens of the state…”  City of Sapulpa v. Land , 223 P. 640, 644, 101 Okl 22. 
“At a minimum standing is composed of three elements.  These components are: (1) 
a legally protected interest which must have been injured in fact-i.e., an 
injury which is actual, concrete and not conjectural in nature, (2) a causal 
nexus between the injury and the complained conduct, and (3) a likelihood as 
opposed to mere speculation, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable 
decision…Finally, assessment of standing is not a decision on the merits.  
Rather, it is a determination whether the plaintiff is the proper party to seek 
adjudication of the asserted issue.”  Cities Servies Co. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 976 
P.2d 545, 547. “At minimum, “standing” contains three elements: plaintiff have 
separate injury in fact, there must be causal connection between injury and 
condict complained of, and it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, 
that injury will be redressed by favorable decision.”  Toxic Waste Impact Group,

“Judicial power is authority to hear and determine, where the rights or persons

adjudication…”  Ward v. Board of Com’rs, 246 P. 376, 378 [quoting In re 
Courthouse of Okmulgee County, 161 P. 200. Oregon: "Literally, the phrase means 
the `body of the crime.' To establish guilt, it is generally necessary for the 
prosecution to show that (a) the injury or harm specified in the crime occurred, 
(b) [that] injury or harm was caused by someone’s criminal activity, and (c) the 
defendant was the guilty party. To sustain a conviction, the requirement of 
independent proof of the corpus delictidemands only that the prosecution have 
introduced independent evidence tending to show (a) and (b). It is not necessary 
that the independent proof tend to connect the defendant with the crime.”  State 
v. Chatelain, 220 P. 3d 41.  [The court here does try to confuse the two thing, 
the injury, the element of the crime, with a procedural rule.] “Standing is an 
aspect of justiciability which may not be waived.”  Strank v. Public Employees 
Retirement Board, 108 P.3d 1058. “A person has standing if resolution of the 
issues presented will have a practical effect on his or her rights.”  Generaux 
v. Dobyns, 134 P.3d 983, 986. “At least in the absence of a statute, a party has 
standing to assert only its own legal rights.”  Estate of Selmar A. Hutchins v. 
Fargo, 72 P.3d 638, 640. “[r]egardless of what the legislature provides 
regarding the standing of litigants to obtain judicial relief, the courts always 
must determine that the constitutional requirements of justiciability are 
satisified. [citation omitted] Specifically, we reasoned that (1) the party that 
invokes the jurisdiction of the court has the “obligation to establish the 
justiciability of the claim…(2) to establish that the claim is justiciable, the 
party “must demonstrate that a decision in this case will have a practical 
effect on its rights.”  Barton v. City of Lebanon, 88 P.3d 323, 326.
 Pennsylvania: “The “corpus delecti consists of the occurrence of a loss or 
injury resulting from some person’s criminal conduct.”  Commonwealth v. 
McMullen, 545 Pa. 361, 681 A.2d 717, 721 (1996).  The corpus delecti rules 
requires the Commonwealth to present evidence that: (1) a loss has occurred; and 
(2) the loss occurred as a result of a criminal agency.  Commonwealth v. May, 
451 Pa. 31, 301 A.2d 368, 369 (1973).”  Commonwealth v. Taylor, 831 A.2d 587, 
591 (Pa. 2003). “It has long been fundamental to the criminal jurisprudence of 
this Commonwealth that a necessary predicate to any conviction if proof of the 
corpus delecti, i.e., the occurrence of any injury or loss and someone’s 
criminality as the source of this injury or loss.  See Commonwealth v. Burns, 
490 Pa. 619, 627, 187 A.2d 552, 556-557 (1963); Commonwealth v. Turza, 340 Pa. 
128, 133, 16 A.2d 401, 404 (1940).”  Commonwealth v. Maybee, 239 A.2d 332, 333. 
“The two elements of “corpus delecti” are that loss or injury has occurred and 
that loss or injury occurred through criminal agency; identity of party 
responsible for act is not element of corpus delecti.”  Com. v. Rieland, 471 
A.2d 490, 491. ““Corpus delecti” consists of occurrence of injury or loss 
consistent with commission of crime by someone.”  Com. v. Daniels, 422 A.2d 196, 
199. ““Corpus delecti,” meaning the body of the crime, consists of an occurrence 
of a specified type of loss or injury and someone’s criminal activity as a 
source thereof.”  Com. v. Ware, 329 A.2d 258, 274, 459 Pa. 334. “The corpus 
delecti is established upon evidence of (1) the occurence of the specific  kind 
of injury or loss; and, (2) someone’s criminality as the source of loss.”  Com. 
Kasunic, 620 A.2d 525, 529. “Pennsylvania appellate courts have repeatedly held 
that corpus delecti consists of the occurrence of injury or loss consistent with 
commission of a crime by someone.”  Commonwealth v. Daniels , 422 A.2d 196, 199. 
“It is a well-settled principal of law that a crime is an offense against the 
sovereignty, a wrong which the government deems injurious not only to the victim 
but to the public at large, and which it punishes through a judicial proceeding 
in the Commonwealth’s name.  21 Am.Jur.2d 61, pp. 115-116.  Though the same 
wrongful act may consititute both a crime and a tort, the tort is a private 
injury which is to be pursued by the injured party.  Id., at [section] 2, p. 
116.  Criminal prosecutions are not to settle private grievances but are to 
rectify the injury done to the Commonwealth.”  Com. v. Malloy, 450 A.2d 689, 
691. “The requirement of standing arises from the principal that judicial 
intervention is appropriate only when the underlying controversy is real and 
concrete.”  Pittsburg Palisades Park, LLC v. Com., 888 A.2d 655. “For standing 
purposes, a “direct interest” in the litigation requires a showing that the 
matter complained of caused harm to the party’s interest…for standing purposes, 
an “immediate interest” in the outcome of the litigation involves the nature of 
the causal connection between the action complained of and the injury to the 
party challenging it.”  In re Hickson, 821 A.2d 1238. “Standing is not conferred 
via a party’s relationship to the proceedings, but is conferred by a direct 
connection to a substantive injury, and by a causal connection between the 
action complained of and the injury to the person challenging it.”  Com v. J.H., 
759 A.2d 1269. Rhode Island: “Before it may obtain a conviction for a criminal 
offense, the state must prove corpus delecti beyond a reasonable doubt.  In re 
Pereira, 111 R.I. 712, 714, 306 A.2d 821, 823 (1973); State v. Maloney, 111 R.I. 
133, 138 n.1, 300 A.2d 259, 262 n.1 (1973).  The corpus delecti comprises two 
elements: a penally proscribed act or injury and the unlawfullness of some 
person in causing the injury.”  State v. Halstead, 414 A.2d 1138, 1143 (R.I. 
1980). “To have standing, the plaintiff must allege to the court’s satisfaction 
that the challenged action has caused him injury in fact, economic or 
otherwise.”  McKenna v. Williams, 874 A.2d 217. “Standing is not determined by 
whether injury caused by challenged action is substantial or insubstantial, but 
only whether there is some injury as opposed to no injury.”  Weybosset Hill 
Investments, LLC v. Rossi, 857 A.2d 231. “By definition, a justiciable 
controversy must contain a plaintiff who has standing to pursue the action; that 
is to say, a plaintiff who has suffered “injury in fact…Injury in fact maybe 
characterized as “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) 
concrete and particularized * * * and (b) actual or immenent, not ‘conjectural’ 
or ‘hypothetical.’”  Meyer v. City of Newport, 844 A.2d 148, 151 (R.I. 2004).
 South Carolina: “in order to authorize a conviction, the state must prove these 
[corpus delecti] elements beyond a reasonable doubt…” State v. Thomas, 73 S.E.2d 
722, 723. “Before any action can be maintained, a justiciable controversy must 
be present…(A justiciable controversy exists when a concrete issue is presented, 
there is a definite assertion of legal rights and a positive legal duty which is 
denied by the adverse party.”)…A plaintiff must have standing to institute an 
action.  Joytime Distrbs. &amp; Amusement Co., Inc. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 639, 
528 S.E.2d 647, 649.”  Sloan v. Greenville County, 590 S.E.2d 338, 346, 347. “”A

Parsons v. South Dakota Lottery Com’n., 504 N.W.2d 593, 595. “‘Generally, for a 
litigant to have standing to bring an action before the court, litigant must 
show that he personally as suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result 
of putatively illegal conduct of defendant.’”  Parsons v. South Dakota Lottery 
Commissioner., 504 N.W.2d 593, 595 (S.D. 1993) (quoting Gladstone, Realtors v. 
Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99…”  Mahan v. Avera St. Luke’s, 621 N.W.2d 150, 154 
(S.D. 2001).  Tennessee: “In order to establish the corpus delecti of a crime, 
the State must establish beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that a certain result has 
been produced and (2) that someone is criminally responsible for the act.  State 
v. Jones, 15 S.W.3d 880, 890-891.”  State v. Ellis, 89 S.W.3d 584, 600. “Corpus 
delecti of crime requires showing that certain result has been produced and that 
result was created through criminal agency.”  State v. Ervin, 731 S.W.2d 70. 
“First we must address the issue of standing, a judge-made doctrine based on the 
idea that ‘[a] court may and properly should refuse to entertain an action at 
the instance of one who rights have not been involved or infringed.’ 59 AmJur.2d 
Parties § 30 (1987).  In state law it parallels the constitutional restriction 
on federal court jurisdiction to “cases and controversies.” U.S. Const. Art. 3 § 
2.  It has been said that no case or controversy is presented where the 
plaintiff lacks standing to sue.  Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1…“In determining 
whether the plaintiff has a personal stake sufficient to confer standing, the 
focus should be on whether the complaining party has alleged an injury in fact, 
economic or otherwise…”  Mayhew v. Wilder, 46 S.W.3rd 760, 767. “In order to 
establish standing, a party must demonstrate three essential elements.  
Metropolitan Air Research Testing Auth. Inc., v. Metropolitan Gov’t of Nashville 
and Durston County, 842 S.W.2d 611, 615…First, the party must demonstrate that 
it has suffered an injury which is ‘distinct and palpable,’…and not conjectural 
or hypothetical…Second, the party must establish a causal connection between the 
injury and the conduct of which he complains…Third, it must be likely that a 
favorable decision will redress the injury…These elements are indispensable to 
the plaintiff’s case, and must be supported by the same degree of evidence at 
each stage of litigation as other matters on which plaintiff bears the burden of 
proof.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560…”  Petty v. Daimler/Chrysler Corp., 91 S.W.3d 
765. “To establish one’s standing to bring an action, “a party must demonstrate 
(1) that it has sustained a distinct and palpable injury, (2) that the injury 
was caused by the challenged conduct, and (3) that the injury is apt to be 
redressed by a remedy the court is prepared to give.”  City of Chattanooga v. 
Davis, 54 S.W.3d 248, 280 (Tenn. 2001).  [By the way, this is a criminal case, 
Marc Stevens] Texas: “Wigmore explains the American concept of the corpus 
delecti rule thus: [Every crime] reveals three component parts, first, the 
occurrence  of the specific kind of injury or loss (as in homicide, a person 
deceased; in arson, a house burnt; in larceny, property missing); secondly, 
somebody’s criminality (in contrast, e.g., to accident) as the source of the 
loss,–these two together involving the commission of a crime by somebody; and 
thirdly, the accused’s identity as the doer of the crime. In most American 
jurisdictions, including Texas, the corpus delecti rules requires some 
corroboration of the first two elements-an injury or loss and a criminal agent…” 
 Salazar v. State, 86 S.W.3d 640, 645. “It is too elementary that injury must be 
plead and proved before a cause of action arises to require the citation of 
authorities.”  Whitesboro Nat. Bank v. Wells, 182 S.W.2d 516, 518. “It is 
axiomatic that standing is the first prerequisite to maintaining a suit.  Hunt 
v. Bass, 664 S.W.2d 323, 324…Persons have standing to sue if they can show that 
(1) they have sustained some direct injury as a result of a wrongful act; (2) 
there is a direct relationship between their alleged injury and the claim sought 
to be adjudicated; (3) they have a personal stake in the controversy; (4) the 
challenged action as caused them an injury in fact, whether economic or 
otherwise…Because standing is a jurisdictional requirement, it may be addressed 
for the first time on appeal.”  Sierra Club v. Cedar Point Oil Co., 73 F3d 546, 
555…” “The Supreme Court held that because the named plaintiff was unable to 
allege and show that he personally had been injured by the defendant’s actions, 
his lack of individual standing precluded the trial court’s exercise of subject 
matter jurisdiction…The court explained that [o]ur state constitution 
contemplates, that plaintiffs seeking redress in the courts must first 
demonstrate standing.  Because the Texas constitution requires the presence of a 
proper party to raise issues before the court, standing is a threshold inquiry 
regardless of whether the plaintiff brings an individual or class action.”  
Polaris Industries, Inc. v. McDonald, 119 S.W.3d   331, 338, 339. “A “cause of 
action” constists of a plaintiff’s primary right and the defendant’s act or 
omission which violates that right. Stone Fort Nat. Bank of Nacogdoches v. 
Forbes, 126 Tex. 568, 91 S.W.2d 674, 676 (1936); Martinez v. Goodyear Tire &amp; 
Rubber Co., 651 S.W.2d 18, 19…Moreover, a “cause of action” comprises every fact 
which is necessary for a plaintiff to prove in order to obtain judgment.”  
Krchnak v. Fulton, 759 S.W.2d 524, 526. “The requirement in this State that a 
plaintiff have standing to assert a claim derives from the Texas Constitution’s 
separation of powers among the departments of government, which denies the 
judiciary authority to decide issues in the abstract, and from the Open Courts 
provision, which provides court access only to a “person for an injury done 
him”. A court has no jurisdiction over a claim made by a plaintiff without 
standing to assert it.  For standing, a plaintiff must be personally aggrieved; 
his alleged injury must be concrete and particularized, actual or imminent, not 
hypothetical.  A plaintiff does not lack standing simply because he cannot 
prevail on the merits of his claim; he lacks standing because his claim of 
injury is too slight for a court to afford redress.”   Daimler Chrysler 
Corporation, v. Bill Inman et al, NO. 03-1189, Texas Supreme Court, 2008. “The 
dissent argues that standing requires only, one, a real controversy that, two, 
will be determined.  Those are requirements for standing, but so is concrete 
injury, because if injury is only hypothetical, there is no real controversy.”   
Daimler Chrysler Corporation, v. Bill Inman et al, NO. 03-1189, Texas Supreme 
Court, 2008. Utah: “Generally,  “‘[t]o establish guilt’ ” in a criminal case, 
“the prosecution [must] show that [1] the injury or harm specified in the crime 
occurred, [2] this injury or harm was caused by someone’s criminal activity, and 
[3] the defendant was the [perpetrator].’ ” State v. Talbot, 665 P.2d 1274, 1276 
(Utah 1983) (citation omitted).  The corpus delecti, or body of the crime, 
involves only the first two elements, however.”  State v. Mauchley, 67 P.3d 477, 
482 (Utah 2003). “”Corpus delecti rule” states that person may not be convicted 
of crime if no independent evidence, outside defendant’s own statement, exists; 
to satisfy doctrine, state must produce independent evidence that injury or harm 
specified in crime occurred and that injury or harm was caused by someone’s 
criminal activity.”  State v. Archuleta, 850 P.2d 1232, 1241. “Mr. Justice 
Cooley, in Post v. Campau, 42 Mich. 96, 3 N.W. 272, said: “The elements of a 
cause of action are, first, a breach of duty owing by one person to another; and 
second, a damage resulting to the other from the breach.”  In Foot v. Edwards, 3 
Blatchf. 313, Fed. Cas. No. 4,908, Mr. Justice Ingersoll said: “The commission 
of an act by the defendant, and damage to the plaintiff in consequence thereof, 
must unite, to give a good cause of action.  No one of these facts by itself is 
a cause of action against the defendant.”  In City of North Vernon v. Vogler, 
103 Ind. 319, 2 N.E. 821, it is said: “In every valid cause of action two 
elements must be present-the injury and the damage.  The one is the legal wrong 
which is to be redressed; the other, the scale or measure of the recovery.”  
Fields v. Daisy Gold Min. Co., 73 P. 521, 522, 26 Utah, 373. “An issue is “ripe” 
for adjudication only when it has sharpened into an actual or imminent clash of 
legal rights.”  Pett v. Autoliv ASP, Inc., 106 P.3d 705. “In general, standing 
is available only to a person who has sustained some injury to her personal, 
legal, or property rights.”  In re E.H., 137 P.3d 809, 819. “To satisfy the 
“basic requirements” of the traditional standing test, “a party must alleged 
that he or she has suffered or will immediately suffer an injury that is fairly 
traceable to the conduct at issue such that a favorable decision is likely to 
redress the injury.”  Chen v. Stewart, 123 P.3d 416, 437 (Utah 2005). “In order  
to have standing, a plaintiff must be able to show that he has suffered some 
distinct and polpable injury that gives him a personal stake in the outcome of 
the legal dispute.”  Council of Holliday City v. Larkin, 89 P.3d 164. “Under 
principals of standing, a party may generally assert only his or her own legal 
rights, and cannot raise the claims of third parties who are not before the 
court.”  Provo City Corp. v. Thompson, 86 P.3d 735. “The requirement that a 
plaintiff demonstrate particularized injury is the traditional test for 
standing.”  Washington County Water Conservancy Dist. v. Morgan, 82 P.3d 1125.
 Vermont: “courts must look behind names that symbolize the parties to determine 
whether a justiciable case or controversy is presented.”  State v. CNA Ins. 
Companies, 779 A.2d 662 (Vt 2001) [quoting United States v. Interstate Commerce 
Commission, 337 U.S. 426 (1949)]. “We examined, accordingly, the substance of 
the plaintiff’s constitutional and civil rights claims, concluding that they 
implicated no legally protected right under the constitution.  We affirmed, 
therefore, the trial court’s dismissal both on lack of standing and on the 
merits.”  Daye v. State, 769 A.2d 630, 633 (Vt. 2000). “To satisfy the standing 
requirement, a plaintiff must show (1) injury-in-fact, (2) causation, and (3) 
redressibility; thus, the plaintiff must allege a personal injury traceable to 
the defendant’s conduct that the court can remedy…”  Brigham v. State, 889 A.2d 
715. “The main standing requirement is that the plaintiff show threat of injury 
to a protected interest.”  Blum v. Friedman, 782 A.2d 1204, 1207. “the phrase 
“judicial power” implies the construction of laws and the adjudication of legal 
rights.”  Gould v. Parker, 42 A.2d 416, 418. Virginia: “But basic concepts of 
our criminal jurispridence cannot be treated lightly in a zealous, and albeit a 
commendable, desire to reduce crime and convict culpits.  Among these safeguards 
is the requirement that the State must establish the existence of the corpus 
delecti and prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt by admissible evidence.”  
Pepoon v. Commonwealth, 66 S.E.2d 854, 859. “Point of standing is to ensure that 
person who asserts a position has substantial legal right to do so and that his 
rights will be affected by disposition of the case.”  Cupp v. Board of Supr’s of 
Fairfax County, 318 S.E.2d 407. “The purpose of requiring standing is to make 
certain that a party who asserts a particular position has the legal right to do 
so and that his rights will be affected by the disposition of the case.”  
Goldman v. Landslide, 552 S.E.2d 67, 71 (Va. 2001). Washington: “All political 
power is inherent in the people, and governments derive their just powers from 
the consent of the governed, and are established to protect and maintain 
individual rights.” Washington constitution article I § 1. “Corpus delecti is 
usually proven by following two elements: injury or loss, and someone’s criminal 
act as cause thereof…”  State v. Smith, 801 P.2d 975, 115 Wash.2d 775. ““Corpus 
delecti” consists of injury or loss and someone’s criminal act which caused it.” 
 State v. Espinoza, 774 P.2d 1177, 1182, 112 Wash.2d 819. “Corpus delecti 
usually consists of two elements: (1)  an injury or loss… and (2)somone’s 
criminal act as the cause thereof.”  City of Bremerton v. Corbett, 773 P.2d 
1135, 138, 106 Wash.2d 569. “In order to establish the corpus delecti of any 
crime there must be shown to have existed a certain act or result forming the 
basis of the criminal charge and the existence of a criminal agency as the cause 
of such act or result.”  State v. Goranson, 408 P.2d 7, 9, [quoting State v. 
Meyer, 37 Wash.2d 759, 763, 226 P.2d 204 (1951)]. “The term corpus delecti means 
the body of the crime, or, to state it differently, that the crime charged has 
actually been committed by some one.  It is made up of two elements: first, that 
a certain result has been produced, as that a human being has died; and second, 
that some one is criminally responsible for the result.  State v. Henderson, 
Or., 184 P.2d 392.”  State v. Jeannet, 192 P.2d 983, 984. “The doctrine of 
standing prohibits a litigant from raising another’s legal rights.  Allen v. 
Wright, 468 US 737, 750-751.”  Huberman v. Public Power Supply System, 744 P.2d 
1032, 1055. “If a plaintiff lacks standing to bring a suit, courts lack 
jurisdiction to consider it.”  High Tide Seafoods v. State, 725 P2d 411, 415 
(Wash. 1986). “Injury in fact element of standing is satisfied when a plaintiff 
alleged the challenged action will cause a specific and personal harm.”  Kucera 
v. State, Dept. of Transp., 995 P.2d 63. “Doctrine of standing prohibits the 
litigant from raising another’s legal rights.”  Haberman v. Washington Public 
Power Supply System, 744 P.2d 1032. Washington DC: “It is an elementary matter 
of jurisprudence that an individual must have standing in order to maintain an 
action.  Basic to standing is the requirement that the individual be injured in 
fact by the conduct of the other party.  See, e.g., Lee v. District of Columbia 
Board of Appeals and Review, 423 A.2d 210 (D.C. 1980).  We find no injury to 
Burleson flowing from United’s conduct.  Burelson is without standing to 
maintain his action against United.”  Burelson v. United Title &amp; Escrow Co. 
Inc., 484 A.2d 535, 537. West Virginia: “It is well-recognized, and we now so 
hold, that [s]tanding…is comprised of three  elements; first, the 
party…[attempting to establish standing] must have suffered an “injury-in-fact” 
– an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and 
particularized and (b) actual or imminent and not conjectural or hypothetical.  
Second, there must be a causal connection [between] the injury and the conduct 
forming the basis of the suit.  Third, it must be likely that the injury will be 
redressed through a favorable decision of the court.”  Findley v. State Farm 
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 576 S.E.2d 807,821. “”Generally, standing is defined as 
‘[a] party’s right to make a legal claim or seek judicial enforcement of a duty 
or right.”" Findley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,  213 W.Va. 80, 94, 576 
S.E.2d 807,821 (2002)…One aspect of standing is that one generally lacks 
standing to assert the rights of another.”  State ex rel. Lueng v. Sanders, 584 
S.E.2d 203, 212 (W.Va. 2003). Wisconsin: “All men are born equally free and 
independent, and have certain inherent rights; among these are life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of  happiness; to  secure these  rights, governments are 
instituted  among men,  deriving their  just powers from the consent of the 
governed.”  Wisconsin constitution article I § 1 . While the corpus delecti must 
be proved beyond all reasonable doubt, yet it may be established by 
circumstantial as well as direct evidence.  Schwantes v. State, 106 N.W. 237, 
127 Wis. 169. “Law of standing is to be construed liberally; where an actual 
injury is demonstrated, even a trifling interest may be sufficient to confer 
standing.”  Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club v. Wisconsin Dept. of Health and 
Social Services, 387 N.W.2d 245. “Wisconsin employs a two-step standing 
analysis.  The analysis requries the court to determine (1) whether the 
plaintiff has suffered a threatened or actual injury, and (2) whether the 
interest asserted is recognized by law.”  Schwittay v. Sheboygan Falls Mut. Ins. 
Co., 630 N.W.2d 772, 776. Wyoming: “A party has standing “only if he has a 
tangible and legally protectable interest at stake in the litigation; his 
interest must be injured or threatened with injury…”  Billings v. Wyoming Bd. of 
Outfitters , 88 P.3d 455, 479 (Wyo. 2004). “the duty of this court, as of every 
judicial tribunal, is limited to determining rights of persons or of property, 
which are actually controverted in the particular case before it.”  Tyler v. 
Judges of the Court of Registration, 179 U.S. 405, 21 SCt. 206, 208. In addition 
to the federal cases cited above: “The plaintiff must show that he himself is 
injured by the challenged action of the defendant.  The injury may be indirect, 
see United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669, 688, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2416, 37 L.Ed.2d 
254 (1973), but the complaint must indicate that the injury is indeed fairly 
traceable to the defendant’s acts or omissions.  Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare 
Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41-42, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1925-1926, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 
(1976); O’Shea v. Littelton, 414 U.S. 488, 498, 94 S.Ct. 669, 677, 38 L.Ed2d 674

L.Ed.2d 536 (1973).”  Vil. of Arlington Hts. v. Metro Housing Dev., 429 U.S. 
252, 262. “Component parts of every crime are the occurrence of a specific kind 
of injury or loss, somebody’s criminality as source of the loss, and the 
accused’s identity as the doer of the crime; the first two elements are what 
constitutes the concept of “corpus delecti.”  U.S. v. Shunk, 881 F.2d 917, 919 
C.A. 10 (Utah). “Most American courts take the view that the phrase “corpus 
delecti” includes first, the fact of an injury or a loss and secondly, the fact 
of somebody’s criminality (in contrast e.g. to accident) as the cause of the 
injury or loss.”  United States. v. Echeles, 222 F.2d 144, 155 (C.A. 10th Cir 
Ill.). “On the contrary, we share the view most American courts that the phrase 
“corpus delecti”includes but two elements: first, the fact of an injury or loss; 
and secondly, the fact of somebody’s criminality as the cause of the injury or 
loss.”  French v. United States, 232 F.2d 736 738, (C.A. 5th Cir. La.). “To 
paraphrase one of the leading cases: ‘Most American courts take the view that 
the phrase “corpus delecti” includes first, the fact of an injury or a loss and 
secondly, the fact of somebody’s criminality (in contrast e.g. to accident) as 
the cause of the injury or loss…’  Manning v. United States, 10 Cir., 215 F.2d

Fam 1 – Times 1995-03-06 – Gazette 1995-04-12 – Independent 1995-03-07 “It is to 
be regarded rather as a reminder that the jurisdiction is limited to the 
resolution of justiciable issues; that the only kind of rights with which the 
court is concerned are legal rights; and that accordingly there must be a real 
and present dispute between the parties as to the existence or extent of a legal 
right”  </BODY></HTML>
