<P align=center>&nbsp;DEFENDANT'S MOTION IN ARREST OF JUDGMENT</P></B></U>
<P align=justify>COMES NOW the defendant, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 17-9-61, 
subsequent to judgment, without waiving any other rights to which he is 
entitled, and respectfully moves this Court to arrest the judgment entered 
against him on May 21, 1992 in the above-styled case on the following 
ground:</P>
<P align=justify>The judgment which was returned against defendant is predicated 
solely upon the defendant's alleged violation of Section 16-10-1 of the Official 
Code of Georgia in that, as a public officer, he violated his oath of office. 
Said statute is unconstitutionally vague, and said judgment thus amounts to a 
denial of defendant's right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the 
United States Constitution.</P>
<P align=center>1.</P>
<P align=justify>The defendant was indicted on the charges of, one, Theft by 
Receiving Stolen Property and, two, Violation of Oath of by a Public Officer 
(O.C.G.A. § 16-10-1). At trial, this Court directed a verdict of acquittal with 
respect to the first charge. A duly sworn and empaneled jury returned a verdict 
of "guilty" against the defendant with respect to the second charge. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>2.</P>
<P align=justify>The Due Process clause of the United States Constitution as 
applied to the State of Georgia via the Fourteenth Amendment mandates that 
"[f]or any particular act or conduct to constitute a criminal offense the 
statute defining the offense, or some other law of the State must in express 
terms declare such conduct to be a violation of the law or provide that it be 
punished as a criminal offense." <U>Wood</U> <U>v</U>. <U>State</U>, 219 Ga. 
509, 511 (1963). </P>
<P align=center>3.</P>
<P align=justify>Furthermore, "a law is void on its face if it is so vague that 
persons of `common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ 
as to its application.'" <U>Gouge</U> <U>v</U>. <U>City</U> <U>of</U> 
<U>Snellville</U>, 249 Ga. 91, 9_ (1982) (quoting <U>Connally</U> <U>v</U>. 
<U>General</U> <U>Construction</U> <U>Co</U>., 269 U.S. 385 (1926)). </P>
<P align=center>4.</P>
<P align=justify>There are two evils that the "void-for-vagueness" doctrine 
seeks to avoid. The first is the "arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement" of 
penal statutes, <U>e.g</U>., <U>Kolender</U> <U>v</U>. <U>Lawson</U>, 461 U.S. 
352, 357 (1983). The second is that "[n]o one may be required at peril of life, 
liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. All are 
entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids." 
<U>Lanzetta</U> <U>v</U>. <U>New Jersey</U>, 306 U.S. 451 (1939). </P>
<P align=center>5.</P>
<P align=justify>O.C.G.A. § 16-10-1 and the Oath of office of a police officer 
of Lithonia Georgia, which is by implication incorporated into this code 
section, are void on the ground that they are unconstitutionally vague. The 
language in question is so vague that persons of common intelligence have to 
guess as to its meaning. U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1.</P>
<P align=center>6.</P>
<P align=justify>Moreover, in this case, both aforementioned constitutional 
evils have manifested themselves. </P>
<P align=justify>A. First, the jury's interpretation of O.C.G.A. § 16-10-1 and 
the defendant's oath of office was the product of unmitigated speculation. </P>
<P align=justify>(1) The statute in question holds that "[a]ny public officer 
who willfully and intentionally violates the terms of his oath as prescribed by 
law shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment for not less 
than one nor more than five years." Defendant was indicted for violating this 
provision by "appropriating to his own use a handgun received in the course of 
his duty as a police officer." </P>
<P align=justify>(2) The defendant's oath of office states: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P align=justify>I do solemnly swear that I will well and truly demean 
    myself as a police officer of the city of Lithonia and that I will 
    faithfully enforce the charter and ordinances of said city of Lithonia to 
    the best of my ability, without fear or favor, and will in all my actions as 
    police officer act as I believe for the best interests of said city, so help 
    me God.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify>When the jury charges are considered together with the 
indictment, it is clear that a jury of laymen was given the authority to 
interpret the cryptic language of the defendant's oath of office without legal 
guidance, and with no clear cut definitions of the terms of the defendant's oath 
of office. </P>
<P align=justify>(3) Upon considering each element of the oath, the act of 
appropriating contraband to one's personal use is not expressly incorporated 
into the language. </P>
<P align=justify>(a) The act of "demeaning" oneself does not create a legal duty 
upon the affiant because a specific act or omission is not defined. The term 
"demean" is a general term, meaning to humble oneself or lower oneself in 
status. WEBSTER'S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY OF THE AMERICAN LANGUAGE (1960). This 
general term is obviously precatory language which can in no way imply a legal 
duty.</P>
<P align=justify>(b) The duty to enforce the charter and ordinances of the city 
of Lithonia is also a general term of precatory nature. It is, moreover, 
inapposite to the facts of this case. Defendant was not charged (nor was such 
ever alleged at trial) with a failure to enforce a municipal law. The "without 
fear or favor" language is obvious reference to the acts of extortion or 
bribery. No reasonable reading of this language could put any reasonable person 
on notice that it proscribes the personal use of contraband weapons.</P>
<P align=justify>(c) The admonition to act in the best interests of the city is 
yet another example of an admonition of a precatory nature.</P>
<P align=justify>B. Finally, O.C.G.A. § 16-10-1 was unquestionably applied to 
defendant in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. Evidence was presented at 
trial to support the allegation that the actions of the defendant which resulted 
in his arrest and indictment--to wit: the pawning of a contraband weapon for a 
nominal amount of U.S. currency--was not isolated to the defendant. Indeed, the 
defendant would submit that if his actions do amount to felonious conduct, then 
he has been singled out for prosecution and the majority of peace officers in 
the state of Georgia have, at one time or another, engaged in much graver 
felonious activities. Therefore, the prosecution of defendant under this theory 
is an example of arbitrary and discriminatory prosecutorial conduct.</P>
<P align=center>7.</P>
<P align=justify>Additionally, and if this honorable Court does find that a jury 
could interpret the language of the statute and oath to address the acts of 
defendant, then defendant would submit that such a broad scope of interpretation 
is of even graver concern. If such "dragnet" language can be used to proscribe 
any act which does not come within its express terms, then what public officer 
can feel secure in executing his duties of office? Indeed, what are the 
delimitations of felonious conduct in this context? Should any indiscrete act of 
a public officer--which need not even amount to a crime under the laws of this 
state or nation--henceforth be brought before a jury of lay people who must 
interpret for themselves the delphic and aspirational language of an oath of 
office to determine whether this act rises to the level of a felony? The 
defendant respectfully submits that by any standard of fairness and equity this 
should not be the case.</P>
<P align=center>8.</P>
<P>The defendant concedes that statutory language cannot be expected to define 
conduct with "mathematical certainty," <U>Grayned</U> <U>v</U>. <U>City of 
Rockford</U>, 408 U.S. 104 (1972), and that a legislature cannot predict every 
possible permutation of a fact pattern arising with regard to a particular 
statute. <U>See</U> <U>generally</U> W.R. LAFAVE &amp; A.W. SCOTT, JR., CRIMINAL 
LAW (2d ed. 1986). Nevertheless, the due process clause mandates that, at 
minimum, a person be placed on notice that conduct which, for non-public 
officials does not amount to a crime under the laws of Georgia or of the United 
States, be delineated in such a manner that reasonable men and women would know 
with reasonable certainty that such conduct is criminal. </P>
<P>WHEREFORE, the defendant prays that this matter be set down for a hearing 
after reasonable notice, and that the judgment be arrested on each and every 
ground hereof.</P>
<P>Respectfully submitted,</P>
