Is the prosecution required to have provided the defendant with written notice of both nature, and cause, and at least an allegation of capacity, standing and jurisdiction, for the defendant to make an informed and voluntary plea? I require notice of such pleadings by the prosecution for immediate inspection.


 Interesting.

This I keep reiterating:

The judge reads the charge, the nature of the charge 

The prosecution is required to have provided you with written notice of both nature, and cause, and at least an allegation of capacity, standing and jurisdiction 

Tickets and citations do not provide notice of cause generally, they only provide notice of nature

They can't provide notice of cause and jurisdiction without exposing that you are improperly before the court charged as a service provider/ civil service worker violating code of conduct for employees and officers, violating statutory commercial duties and obligations 

So the judge asks if you understand (both nature and cause when he asks if you understand the charge after only reading the nature)

And because the judge works for the state and is an extension of the prosecution its the judges job to conceal the lack of states cause and then pretend your refusing to plea instead of unable for lack of notice of cause

So you ask :

Does entering a plea of any kind admit jurisdiction and serve as a waiver of my probable cause hearing?

I'm not asking for legal advise, but for you to declare the law in answer to questions of law

Process Stoppers

Hey Judge...
am I entitled to a meaningful, fair and impartial hearing, of the basis and grounds for my exceptions, objections, and affirmative defenses, at a preliminary examination or probable cause hearing?
And does entering any plea admit jurisdiction and serve of as a waiver of my right to a preliminary examination or probable cause hearing?
(schooled by the best, with no option but to say, yes)
[So... schedule it, bitch.]

THIS WEEKS TOP POST 
Award goes to Azar YisraEl
Judge Judas - Be quiet, shut up.
Response - Objection : void for vagueness, point of clarification.
Are you objecting for the prosecution?
What do you mean by shut up? Do you mean shut up the door so nobody can leave alive? And what do you mean by be quiet? Is quiet another fiction of law? Who is quiet? Do you mean stop making breathing noises? Or stop defending myself and raising issues and objections by speaking?
Is the right to remain silent the only right this court recognizes or I am permitted to exercise?
NOTE : That just one, maybe two statements by the judge, generating at least: Nine valid, relevant, and legitimate questions about his, the speakers, meaning and intent.
How many more can you think of?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
QUESTIONS OF LAW and LEGAL ADVICE
Judge Judas - im not here to answer your questions and would strongly advise you obtain a lawyer for that.
Response - "A judge, the fact finder, is required to declare the law in answer to questions of law but forbidden from giving legal advice.
asking what the law says is a question of law, and asking what I should do is a request for advice. Are you confused about the meaning of my words, or am I confused about the meaning of yours? ..."
These things, facts, and opinions, are easily confused, if your not paying attention to the rappers spell casting word play and games.
Nature and cause are as separate and distinct, as facts and suggestions.
Like those two pillars of power, on either side of the Masonic checker board. Holding up the Roof.
If you ask a question of law, and fact, and the court miss-characterizes your question of law or fact to be a request for legal advice, he is either confused, or being intentionally evasive and non responsive in avoidance of his duty and obligation to declare the law in answer to your question of law.
Let me say that again:
"If I ask a question of law and the court miss-characterizes MY question of law to be a request for legal advice, the judge is either confused about MY meaning or being intentionally evasive and non responsive in avoidance of his duty and obligation to declare the law in answer to MY question of law."
And when he pulls that slight of hand, neuro linguistic programming word magic, misconstruing and misinterpreting your statements and requests for additional information to be a request for advice, you immediately object and take exception for that reason and point it out to him on record. It is your duty and obligation to correct your subordinate public servants when in error, and show them you can JUDGE Plain Error well enough, to recognize theirs.

I've noticed that a few are trying to tackle the judge ordering a psyche eval. 
Demanding the judge produce a masters in psychology, unfortunately, and for good cause, is not going to get you very far and may get you in trouble.
If there is reasonable, clear and convincing cause to believe the defendant does not understand the nature of the proceedings, the judge is permitted, and by law required to order an examination by a medical professional.
And, you can rest assured that pseudo science witch-doctors and Alchemists have been sponsored to fill the gap and given the open door to work perversion and corruption for the prosecution in official sounding conclusions and determinations admissible as evidence.
Courts are not permitted to try the insane and those who do not understand the nature of the proceedings, deemed cruel and unusual punishment, this being the reason I may always admit fair notice of nature, as the ice breaker for DENYING haved recieved enough information being provided by the prosecution to address his unstated CAUSE of and for his action.
This inability to understand, in part, may be the result of the prosecution providing inadequate notice, and not a mental defect or disease.
The judge will often order an eval to frustrate the defendant, because he doesn't like you and is working for the prosecution, without stated cause, grounds or reason for the eval, and you are entitled to a probable cause hearing and finding or determination before such an eval, that you may challenge at a probable cause hearing, if you immediately demand one when the judge orders such an eval.
He orders it... You immediately ask for reason and cause, to be found and determined at an evidentiary hearing, clearly articulated cause and grounds for the eval that you can respond to.
Read the rules for psyche Evals.
They are very specific. If the judge blurts out psyche eval, and you don't blurt out statement of cause required and probable cause hearing demanded, you waive your right to one by not knowing any better.
There is another angle to be exploited here as well.
I will always, after immediately demanding a Probable cause hearing of the grounds for the eval, consent to such an examination, on record and according to the rules of discovery only, invoking my right to remain silent and not answer questions about the case off record asked by third party investigators for the prosecution in a clinical setting.
Clinical Evals break all the rules of pretrial discovery. And they don't conduct any scientific or medical examination of the head or brain.
Admittedly, They engage in subjective religious discrimination.
There is no definitive model of normal from which to deduce abnormal.
Yes, they are witch doctors. And I for one, enjoy making fools of them, on record, in the court room.
A psych eval is a golden opportunity, if you look at it the right way, to establish that the Psychiatrist or Psychologist cant understand the cause or the nature of and for the proceedings himself, if your quick witted enough to ask the right questions.
Like : can one reasonably be expected to understand the nature of the proceedings, something that you as an expert witness are expected and required to have knowledge of and determine, if the court room looks the same in judicial proceedings, as it does in administrative proceedings, and if the paper work fails to clearly state which are being conducted here, where as here both types of proceedings may be conducted in the same court room by different or the same judge?
Can you identify which hat the judge is wearing and which would be a proper description of the nature of these proceedings, whether judicial, or administrative, conducted in accordance with which particular and disticnt rules that are at times conflicting between the two types of proceedings I have mentioned, as different as the by a preponderance of the evidence, and beyond a reasonable doubt, standards of proof?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LivemanWinston Smith: is that an order? if not, judge, by you saying shut up; is that some form of intimidation upon i? do you wish to seal my lips before this open court and wish to render a verdict without the god given right the creator gave i to state my claim?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What you say - What you Dont say
You have a right to remain silent, and everyone insists you exercise your right to shut up. Because really saying something, is really dangerous.
If you have a duty and obligation to get up in church and testify, you must necessarily waive that right, to remain silent, and you will, if you want to avoid waiving your opportunity to advance or failing to make timely made affirmative defenses and counter complaints when required, at an evidentiary hearing requesting clarification of probable cause and a judicial finding and determination of sufficient facts and requisite jurisdictional elements alleged in support of any charge, claim, or complaint against you, establishing fair notice of subject matter jurisdiction warranting binding the case over for trial of the controversy or facts and law disputed and in question.
Just what exactly is in question here, anyway?
Does the prosecution dispute I'm exempt and Immune from the pirate's statutory code of conduct and subject only to the law of nature without contract for specific performance of official public duties and obligations to the state or any private party, like the contract for specific performance the person of the court owes fulfillment of to me, Mr. subordinate public servant, fiduciary, and trustee?
Who have I wronged, the people or an individual, or the corporate state?
Am I accused of failing to perform a contractural obligation, or dereliction of duty, without contract for specific performance?

Rule Number One
Always, always, always, ask why. Everytime the judge moves, says, or orders anything, ask WHY.
Cause, grounds, reasons, basis.
"Because"
If you don't ask why, if you don't ask for cause, it's assumed that you understand the reason and consent

Questioning The Inquisitor

would you have some cause or reason to avoid answering a question of law, being duty bound acting in a judicial capacity to declare the law in answer to questions of law, or to miss-characterize a direct question of law incorrectly to be a request for legal advice or suggestions concerning some course of action?

Answer : No

Are you required to inform me of my rights and the possible consequences, penalties and sacrifices associated with entering any plea, which may consent to and waive challenges to jurisdiction and a probable cause or examination hearing and the opportunity to challenge standing and status along with the sufficiency of alleged facts and jurisdictional elements required to provide fair notice and adequate service of process?

WHICH WAY DOES HE GO?

its funny. Sometimes I can't help but think...
Nothing at all really exists, except my illusions.
Reflections of my imagination
Smoke on the water, fairy dust, magic beans, and purple haze
Hot air and flights of fancy
Schizophrenic paranoid delusional ideations
Lots of opinions, suggestions, and interpretations, but very few facts.
