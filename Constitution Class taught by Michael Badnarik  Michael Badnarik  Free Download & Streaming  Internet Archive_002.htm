<P class="content">The 2004 Libertarian Presidential Candidate, Michael Badnarik 
 teaches his famous class about the Constitution.<BR><BR>If you don't know the 
 difference between a right and a privilege, this is a must see!  If you think 
 you know the difference, then answer this question:  Is the US a democracy?  
For  the answer (surprisingly), watch this.<BR><BR>For more info on Badnarik's 
2004  campaign for President, please visit 
http://www.badnarik.org<BR><BR>Imagine Bush  and Kerry in a debate with 
Badnarik... He'd wipe the floor with both of  them.<BR><BR><BR><SPAN

-     February 15, 2013  <BR><B>Subject:</B>  Speaking truth....to emptiness   
<BR>  Dear Mr. Morpheusone, <BR><BR>there is no need for panic. <BR><BR>We can 
 see that you are no libertarian. <BR><BR>you are opposed to liberty, the 
freedom  granted by an Almighty actually-existing sovereign God to learn how to 
conduct  life and living in self-responsibility. <BR><BR>Perhaps you should 
start with  the standard admission. Here is what you might wish to say: 
<BR><BR><BR>I,  morpheusone, am a communist. <BR><BR>I admit I have a problem. 
<BR><BR>I admit  that I have a problem with freedom and perhaps with white 
people.<BR><BR>I have  believed the propaganda fed to me while I was in public 
school, and I do not  know how to get rid of it. <BR><BR>In fact I confess my 
standard distrust of the  history of white people, and especially if they are 
God-loving, god-fearing,  history knowing, or respectors of the American 
Founding Fathers. <BR><BR>I know  that my own model is Karl Marx, and that I can 
only relax when a full  dictatorship comes to power. I worship the New World 
Order, even though I cannot  officially admit to any religious tendency. 
<BR><BR>My happiness starts with the  misery of others. <BR><BR>When I have free 
time, I harang others who believe in  goodness, kindness, love and being 
positive, and I try to convince them <BR>that  any respect for other races 
(other than my priveledged own), or any respect for  Christianity, should be met 
with scorn, contempt, mockery or derision. <BR><BR>I  have allowed hatred to 
permeate my life. I hope to get others to despise their  own heritage as much as 
I despise myself and my own. <BR><BR>And I have taken to  a personal emulation

 Badinarik is currently a National Director for the new freedom movement that is 
 sweeping the nation. He is also the State Coordinator for Texas. Michael 
 Badinarik, Bob Schultz, G. Edward Griffin and others, have called for a 
 Continental Congress in November of 2009. This is a grass roots movement of the 
 people, for the people, and by the people. It allows the people of each state 
to  nominate and elect delegates to represent their state in the CC2009. 
<BR><BR>Just as the Continental Congress of 1774 gave us our beloved Declaration 
of  Independence, the Continental Congress of 2009 is a movement to restrain the 
 government and enforce the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and 
 the Bill of Rights. This is an opportunity for American citizens to stand up 
for  their beloved Constitution and show the government that we will hold them 
 accountable to adhere to the laws of the Republic and the people they 
 serve.<BR><BR>Here is a link to the Continental Congress 2009 website.<BR>

 hello all i have watched and listened to all 7 classes of mr badnarik i must 
 say he has added fuel to the fire inside me that no other political ideal has 
in  my 39 years i have read all the comments posted so far and 1 thing is 
certain  (we) as in the poeple all except the first amendment and are very 
willing to use  it (some) in the people may elect not to use thier second 
amendment voluntarily  dont encroach on my unalienable right after thinking of 
(all) the people who may  or may not like or agree or disagree to me these are 
the most important is this  why they are one and two and the other eight speak 
for them themsleves as  enumerated if anyone out there thinks you cant be self 
goverened then you have  no self control or a sense of right and wrong if you 
need someone to tell you  eveyrthing that should be done and how to do it 
sheeple then perhaps you should  live in a more socialist or more communist or 
more domocratic place then our set  forth republic which has been perverted form 
its orginal form as of 5-17-2009  the latest it has every been at this point and 
the current administration only  your GOD and the self evident truths of LIBERTY 
will be your saviour do you have  the heart to fight for what is yours or are 
you.................enough of my  ramblings no punctuation just looking to stir 
someones FIRE and get a recent  update to this review i will spread the word of

-     October 23, 2008  <BR><B>Subject:</B>  Badnarik and EricWhoRU can open up 
 your mind...  <BR>  There will always be two camps: <BR><BR>Those that believe 
 men are capable of self-governance and those who must be ruled like beasts of 
 the field.<BR><BR>It has been my eperience that those two camps are 
 irreconcileable. Those who subscribe to the belief that most men need to be 
 ruled over by elitist elements are anti-Christians and deny the God of Abraham, 
 Isaac, and Jacob. This includes self-professed Christians, Anarchists, 
 Satanists, Luciferians, Deists, Hindus, Buddhists, etc.<BR><BR>The other camp 
 believes in the True and Living God; He who grants each of His created men with 
 inalienable rights. Privileges are for citizens and chattel per the auspices of 
 State. Rights are for those who understand that freedom and liberty are not the 
 same thing. An individual may be imprisoned and yet have liberty. But a person 
 without liberty can never be free. Except within the confines of a person's 
 mind. And that would be the makings of an excellent form of slavery; the 
 ultimate slave is the one that  believes himself to be free  when in fact he is 
 quite regulated in his daily life. <BR><BR>The Magna Carta does not grant you 
 freedom from tyranny. Nor does the Declaration of Independence. Although the 
 latter declares such it is an announcement not a license. Physical freedom 
comes  at a very high price. If a man is not willing to give up his life to 
maintain or  preserve such freedom then it is unobtainable to him. <BR><BR>Now, 
for a more  radical concept. The U.S. Constitution was not written to free the 
common man.  Why would the former aristocrats give up their station? Why would a 
man like  Thomas Jefferson, who owned some 200 slaves, give credence to such a 
document if  it made the common man equal to him and those of his ilk?<BR><BR>As 
for the the  Bill of Rights they were necessary to get the U.S. Constitution off 
the ground  due to the unpopularity of the document. The U.S. Constitution was 
not well  received in its day. The Confederation was hijacked by the 
aristocrats, which  you know as WE THE PEOPLE, and pandered to the masses of 
Americans as necessary  for their freedom. What it ended up creating was a 
corporation operating out  Washington D.C. that gave us a king and the American 
version of the House of  Lords and House of Commons.<BR><BR>Washington rules 
over all the citizens  because they volunteer into a system without even knowing 
what is going on. It  is very similar to the movie THE MATRIX. The average 
citizen does not want to  know what is really going on around them so long as 
everything is rosy. <BR><BR>But everything is not rosy. That birth certificate 
you possess, that driver's  license you carry, that national ID card that you 
will soon be mandated to have  on your person 24 hours a day under penalty of 
law, the court systems across  this land, the incorporating of your hometown, 
placing a license plate on your  vehicle, etc. are all evidences that you are 
the property of State; you are a  CITIZEN; participation in this system is 
strictly voluntary. Even though you do  not understand it you have volunteered 
into it just as your parents and  grand-parents before you. Like a slow boiled 
frog the sheeple have been  incrementally enslaved. Think not? Then why is 
socialism rampant in this land  today?<BR><BR>Just give the sheeple his bread, 
wine and circuses and he is  lulled back to sleep. Until the shearing or 
slaughter finds its way to his door  step and that of his neighbors. Hitler was 
democratically elected by a wide  margin. So go ahead and vote for the lesser of 
two evils; evil always begets  evil so do not be surprised when you find 
yourself surrounded by more of the  same throughout your days on this 
earth.<BR><BR>As the True Christians are  persecuted in the coming days the 
world will become a very dark place. The  purification of God's people has 
begun. Meanwhile the rest of humanity is being  called out of Babylon but most 
have not he eyes and ears to come to their  senses. God's chosen come to 
understand liberty in its truest form. The rest  will panic and suffer without 
ever understanding, in this life, what is really  going as Satan and his minions 
make a conflagaration of this planet under a one  world order of peace and 
safety for all sheeple. <BR><BR>Take control of your  life and examine all the 
traditions that have so inured you. You have been lied  to since birth; Santa 
Claus; the Tooth Fairy; the Easter Bunny; the origins of  Valentine's Day; 
Halloween; Christmas. Paganism prevails and has always  prevailed in this world. 
But soon comes a day of reckoning and the powers  prevailing in this world will 
become powerless.<BR><BR>Wake up or you will be  living in a police state where 
the right to life will become a fairy tale.</P>

-      April 14, 2008  <BR><B>Subject:</B>  Information about Michael's class 
 and what he's doing today.  <BR>  Michael Badnarik wrote on his website 
 (constitutionpreservation.org) <BR>-<BR>"I recently discovered that this class 
 was presented in Houston on September 8th, 2001, only three days before the 
 tragedy in New York City. The video was digitized by my friend Kelly, and 
posted  on his website. These seven video files rapidly became the most 
downloaded files  on his site, and there are now close to twenty archive sites 
on the internet  where they can be found. NO, I do not make the three-ring 
binder handout  available anymore. This was only the ninth time I ever presented 
my class, and  it is less sophisticated than my 12-hour DVD version of the 
class. In spite of  that, I suspect I may be more famous (better known) for 
these videos than I am  for running for President of the United 
States."<BR>-<BR>What's Michael Badnarik  up to these days?<BR>He has decided to 
join the Free State Project to further to  cause of liberty. This is what he has 
said about it:<BR>-<BR>"I am proud to  be one of the many American patriots who 
endorses the Free State Project. Many  people claim to support freedom, however 
the members of the Free State Project  have made a commitment to DO something 
about it. Like the signers of the  Declaration of Independence, they have 
pledged their lives and fortunes in  support of the cause of Liberty. They have 
promised to leave their homes across  America to relocate in New Hampshire to 
become part of the biggest freedom  movement since the Pilgrims left England on 
the Mayflower.<BR><BR>    As a proud  member of the Free State Project, I want 
to help prove that Liberty promotes  happiness, and a higher standard of living. 
I want to rekindle the spirit of  independence by demonstrating that people are 
capable of living peacefully with  little or no government interference in their 
lives. If you believe that you are  the best person to make the crucial 
decisions about your life, please join me as  a member of the Free State 
Project. Make a commitment to come to New Hampshire  to help me "Light the fires 
of Liberty". It's not every day that you have an  opportunity to shape the 
course of history."<BR><BR>You can learn more about  this project

Ignorant Ramblings  <BR>  JNagarya: Your comments are utterly ridiculous and 
 ignorant.<BR><BR>First, the Constitution is steeped in history, particularly 
 that of the Founding Fathers and the Revolution for Independence. Libertarians 
 are well-versed in that history, their viewpoints regarding the Constitution 
and  freedom being nigh impossible without it. Indeed, libertarians advocate a 
return  to the past, particularly in how the Constitution (and its purpose) were 
 originally viewed historically in the past.<BR><BR>As far as jabbering goes, 
you  are one to talk, Sir, as you ignorantly jabber on about libertarians 
wanting to  eliminate the rule of law! Preposterous and absurd. Indeed, 
libertarians seek to  RESTORE the Rule of Law rather than allow the government 
to do as it wishes and  continually break the law, namely the Constitution, the 
highest law in the  land.<BR><BR>And then you try to obfuscate and confuse the 
issue by claiming the  Founding Fathers were "liberals" which is true in a 
technical sense -- but  likewise it is also technically true that today's 
Democrats were the original  Republicans. You fail to take into consideration 
the classical meaning of  "liberal" in that era versus what it means today -- 
but you knew that already,  in fact you purposely used it to obfuscate and 
confuse anyone who reads your  vitriol and doesn't know the difference. I would 
commend you on your cleverness  but it wasn't all that clever and as they say in 
Internet parlance "I see what  you did there."<BR><BR>Your comment on the 
meaning of the Second Amendment shows  you are stupendously void of the very 
history you blast libertarians for  lacking. Sir, the Founders fought and died 
to stop a Tyrant named George from  enslaving them. Don't spit on their deeds by 
claiming untruths about them. They  knew as well as you do that without a 
defense against government LIKE THE ONE  THEY FOUGHT, tyranny and corruption 
will reign. This is obvious in the lengths  they went to to protect us with the 
Bill of Rights, but if you're too blind to  see that then all you have to do is 
read their own words, they wrote plenty of  documents besides the Declaration 
and the Constitution and they were quite plain  in what they believed. I 
recommend starting with Jefferson. That alone should be  enough.<BR><BR>And then 
you blather on about libertarians being "corporatist".  No Sir, it is ignorant 
Neocons such as yourself that support the depredations of  corporations with big 
government interference in the natural course of business.  There is no actual 
thing you can touch called a corporation, there are only  people. Corporations 
only exist on paper and can only cause harm if allowed to  via corrupt 
politicians asking for bribes. Capitalism is not evil, Sir.  So-called 
corporations in bed with corrupt government stooges are.<BR><BR>There  can be no 
political ideology greater than the freedom for men and women to go  about their 
daily business without government interference. Only when one person  has harmed 
another and violated the rights of life, liberty or property of  another should 
the law you are so fond of touting be involved and even then it  should not be 
administered by the most corrupt, inept and anti-freedom group  that exists.</P>

-     February 25, 2008  <BR><B>Subject:</B>  Re: JNagarya  <BR>  Far be it to 
 give you advice on how to post replies.<BR><BR>But more for the sake of other 
 users here:<BR><BR>You use fanciful words that only lead me to believe you're 
 hiding behind them. For what a man can say genuinely, he can say in plain 
 understanding of the common ear.<BR><BR>Yes, he could be too idealistic, yes 
the  definition of stupidity is to repeat mistakes...and still Michael makes 
good  points. <BR><BR>If you don't agree with everything, point it out. But if 
you  came here to base a few of his mistakes as the basis for discrediting 
EVERYTHING  he had to say, then keep your comments where they belong...in the 
safety of your  own mind. <BR><BR>He does speak some truth, and I admire that. 
We are too  apathetic, and the American Society has a ton of people that seem to 
be just as  you talk and act. Well informed, well versed in speaking, and full 
of fiery  apathetic support.<BR><BR><BR>I am personally tired of apathy and 
doing nothing.  If you are afraid of people thinking for themselves (which is 
defined in your  post) then good!<BR><BR>Be scared and do something about it. We 
are apathetic,  but is that because we are happy? I doubt it. I believe we are 
being conditioned  from birth to be pacified with lots of bread and 
entertainment...as long as we  work...obediently...willingly. <BR><BR><BR>In and 
of itself, this is fine, but  allows bad things to come in the long term. We 
become pampered slaves, slowly  and willingly.<BR><BR>Michael said freedom is 
hard work, and not everyone should  feel the need to fight tooth and nail for 
it. He realizes people from a lot of  angles. You should try it....if nothing 
else than to soften the nasty things you  may or may not keep to yourself.</P>

-     January 24, 2008  <BR><B>Subject:</B>  Beyond uninformed, dangerous --   
<BR>  It's unfortunate the inability to distingusih between law, on one hand -- 
 as in "Constitution" -- and on the other, olitical idiology.  I've yet to 
listen  to are talk with a "Libertarian" who knew the difference; who did not 
substitute  political idiology for law.<BR><BR>Worse, the "Libertarian" 
"philosophy" lives  in an ahistorical vacuum -- it's as if the past never 
happened; thus it is  possible to posit reinventing the wheel, from scratch, as 
if the wheel hadn't  already been invented.  As if it weren't already known that 
a square wheel won't  roll. <BR><BR>Clue: man tried living in societies without 
the rule of law.  It  didn't work because man is imperfect.  So we have 
"Libertarians" jabbering about  eliminating the rule of law, and substituting 
therefor man's entusiasm for  accepting personal responsibility. <BR><BR>And 
then there's the additional flaw  of invoking the Founders and Framers as being 
"Libertarian" -- or  "Libertarian"-like.  In fact, they were Liberals. 
<BR><BR>As for the  "Libertarian"'s bogus claim that the Second Amendment 
protects an individual  right: the reality is this: No sane, non-sucicdal  
society leaves dangerous  substances or objects lying around unregulated.  The 
further reality is this --  easily learned by reading the debates by the Framers 
of the Bill of Rights: As  in "We the people," in the Second Amendment is 
_PLURAL_.  The Framers of that  which became the Second Amendment did debate a 
possible individual right: that  of the "person" -- indivdual -- "religiously 
scrupulous of" -- AGAINST --  "bearing arms" not being "compelled" -- 
INVOLUNTARY -- to perform militia DUTY.  <BR><BR>Those are not complicated 
facts, and are easily found for oneself:  _Creating the Bill of Rights: The 
Documentary Record from the First Federal  Congress_ (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 
1991), Ed. by Helen E. Veit; and _The  Complete Bill of Rights: The Drafts, 
Debates, Sources, &amp; Origins_ (NY:  Oxford, 1997), Ed. by Neil H. Cohen.  
Both are in print and readily  availabe.<BR><BR>The corporatist "Libertarian" -- 
for that is the reality behind  "Libertarian"ism -- laissez faire non-regulation 
of the powerful -- Badnarik  won't tell you those facts, doubtless becaues he 
doesn't know them.  But, then  again, "Libertarians" are against the rule of law 
to begin with -- wanting to  dump it all for a tried-and-failed pie-in-the-sky 
delusion -- so have netierh  interest in learning the actual law, nor the 
willingness to distnguish between  law and political idiology instead of 
substituting the latter for the  former.</P>

-     January 1, 2007  <BR><B>Subject:</B>  Sorry but this is not excellent   
<BR>  Thanks for an interesting presentation, probably as good as the average 
 community college professor. But Mr. Badnarik himself is living within his own 
 frame of reference, his own ideological assumptions that affect the 
presentation  badly.  I found it painful, again and again to hear him state some 
assertion  about what the constitution "is", as if it were received knowledge.  
There is  very little factual proof offered for his countless statements of what 
the  constitution is, or what the authors were thinking or intending.  BOTTOM 
LINE  the constitution allows  us all to live, and keep out of each others' way, 
while  *not* agreeing on all these things Badnarik asserts about property rights 
and so  forth.</P>

-     October 26, 2006  <BR><B>Subject:</B>  Live free or die slaves  <BR>  I 
 have watched all the video's several times. In my opinion they are great and 
the  dialogue and the analogies he uses really put it in to perspective. If you 
 truely get what he is saying you are probly as scared as I am. <BR><BR>The 
truth  is we all have a job to do and to be perfectly honest,it is an up hill 
battle. I  am scared to death, but Iam willing to give everything for the future 
of our  kid's.<BR><BR>Just think about it. If it is this bad now, how bad is it 
going to  be when my four year old little<BR>girl grows up and has to go work 
for slave  wages? I feel paralized and helpless. But I refuse to believe that 
there is  nothing I can do.<BR><BR>The gov't has not really left us any choice 
other then  to take up arms. They are saying if you want your freedom come and 
take it if  you can, because we aren't giving it back. They have created to many 
jobs that  have to do with controling our lives. The people that have these 
gov't jobs will  fight to keep them and that means the control will not stop. So 
what are we to  do???<BR><BR>If you have ever really listened to the the bands 
on your twisted  transistor(radio) today, such as Nine Inch Nails, Slip Knot, 
Avenge Sevenfold,  Metallica, Eminem, Tool, Rage Against The Machine, The 
Offspring, KORN, Green  Day, ect. You would hear the rythum of a war drum. For 
instance Nine Inch Nails,  Trent Reznor in his album WITH TEETH he is Asking if 
you "are going to bite the  hand that feeds you or are you going to stay down on 
your knees". SLIP KNOT is  like, the new age Religous music and in my opinion 
they ROCK!! TOOL ask you if  you "are going to bow down to the New World Order" 
and also how they "sure could  use a vacation from this bull-shit three ring 
circus side show". Rage Against  the Machine(Politicle Musicle Revolutionist) 
covers just about every thing, kind  of like Michael Badnarik. <BR><BR>I would 
like to know what the remedy is to the  D.M.V. situation, if we have bought a 
used car. Is it the UCC1 financing  agreement/securety agreement as per 
California V.C. 370 ???  <BR><BR>To the  government drones that may read this 
review: I would like to quote something  from a movie, "I didn't come here to 
tell you how it's going to end, I came here  to tell you how it's going to 
begin"(The MATRIX).</P>

 to tell us that the government is taking all our rights away from us.. doesnt 
 anyone care that we have the right to bear arms yet we have to ask permission( 
a  permit) If you disagree with what Michael is saying then you are an enemy of 
 what america was established for. You are a friend to terrorism. Most of these 
 laws were only created because the Africans that were captured were freed. We 
 have to ask permission to be married. Why? Why do I have to ask the government 
 to change my name? Why do I need a social security number is it a bar code? 
 Whose property am? I thought I owned this body but for some reason the 
 government feels otherwise.  Why do we need these things? We don't, but this 
 country and its citizens for the most part are hynotized into thinking that we 
 do. Why does our government create rules that we have to follow. Why do I have 
 to pay taxes? I shouldn't. Wasn't that the point of the revolutionary war. To 
be  a sovereign people? To not have to pay taxes? But what do we do? Comply. As 
long  as we apease these tyrants that have us under their thumb, as a people, as 
a  country, we're destined to suffer.</P>

-     August 11, 2006  <BR><B>Subject:</B>  TRUE Knowledge IS Power !  <BR>  I 
 just want to add, now that I've heard a bit more of the first class (I have 
dial  up and it takes hours to load just to hear a few minutes at a time) about 
"OUR"  land or property.  I have to disagree with Michael on this, because we do 
NOT  "own" "our" land - the Federal gov't and state owns it - we just 'rent' the 
 "privledge" to stay on it for as long as THEY see fit !  IF WE really "OWNED" 
 our land, no one could come along and tax it !  AND it could never be seized by 
 anyone!  TRUE, our Founders established this nation as a no-tax nation, but 
 since 1860, this has been a Socialist dictatorship and the gov't owns 
 everything, and everyone if they are a "citizen" of this Corporate Federal 
Union  Government.  Our Founder's gov't and nation was SEIZED IN 1860 !<BR>Get 
the true  history of America !<BR><BR>I just explained all this in my last 
newsletter to  my list.<BR>Lincoln and his Republican Party seized this gov't 
and nation in  1860 and we still live with THAT "governmnet" ever since !  I'm 
sure you've  heard the *proud* saying of the Republicans - 'we are the party 
(gov't) of  Lincoln.'  It's true, unfortunately !  They even invented a 'hero' 
out of  Lincoln for "history" that was to be brainwashed into all future 
generations  !<BR>They made that smooth-talking tyrant into a virtual god 
!<BR><BR>Remember -  those who are in power are who get to say what 'history' 
will say and be written  !  ALL nations do this !  This is all explained on web 
site  http://TriDownTruthRoad.com<BR>The history section is half way down the 
 list.<BR>I hope that Michael will offer reading articles about his classes, as 
 many of us can't load his videos.<BR><BR>But we do NOT "own" the land we call 
 'ours' - the gov't does !  That is why we pay "rent" (taxes) on it - which by 
 the way is FORBIDDEN BY OUR CONSTITUTION(S).  So are the controls gov't puts on 
 "our" land with their Communist Zoning !  <BR><BR>Yes we have several 
 Constitution(s), each one built on the one before it, but ALL are still active. 
  NONE of them have ever been 'discontinued' !<BR><BR>Lincoln is who first began 
 taxation of the land and the people (income tax) and he just wrote up his own 
 "Amendments" and attached them to the Constitution that were never legally 
 ratified !<BR>To know WHY our current "government" is the way it is, you need 
to  know our TRUE past history and how it all began and became this way !<BR>See 
why  1860 and the Civil War era is called the time our Constitution and nation 
and  government DIED.  And why America has never been the same nation since !  
OR the  "free" nation we have consistently been told to believe it is !<BR>Find 
out how  the Democrats and Republicans are just two branches of the SAME party 
and how  the SAME Elite Powers control and owns them both !<BR>

<BR>  The Constitution Class by Congressional hopeful Michael Badnarik is 
 nothing short of awesome! Aside from a couple of rather controversial remarks 
 about Roosevelt (which I'm certain are correct) but nonetheless floored me, I 
 found this class extremely informative and a must see by as many people that 
can  be exposed to it. <BR><BR>Thank you Mr. Badnarik! My hopes are with your

-     July 23, 2005  <BR><B>Subject:</B>  devolves into insanity  <BR>  This 
 video is very entertaining. Badnarik is an engaging speaker, and definitely 
 believes what he is saying. The first few hours are very informative if 
somewhat  incorrect (When he says something that seems too good to be true, it 
probably  is, especially concerning allodial land titles which he refers to in 
the first  hour. The titles to which he refers are "pseudo-allodial", in which 
you  basically end up paying the future property taxes on the land in a lump 
sum. It  is more a form of hedging against increased assesment values than any 
attainment  of rights.) <BR><BR>The entire seven hours of the video can be 
summed up in a  short sentence - "You can do anything you want if you're willing 
to kill anyone  who tries to stop you." The lecture focuses on the difference 
between  "privileges" and "rights", "privileges" being granted by a higher 
authority and  "rights" being self-granted in the presence of no higher 
(recognized) authority.  So, basically, you have the right to do anything you 
want, as long as you are  willing to assert the right. This basically means that 
you have to shoot anyone  that says otherwise. For example, you have the "right" 
to own any number of guns  you want, and the government may have no "right" to 
them. However, that doesn't  mean the government can't try to take them, and 
basically means that you have to  shoot any government agent that tries to take 
them. Badnarik becomes more and  more overt about this through the hours of 
video, eventually saying, literally,  that if FDR were still alive today, he 
would assassinate him personally, and  that if any government agent tries to 
take his guns, that he will shoot them.  <BR><BR>From this, any person can 
declare a plot of land on which they reside to  be their property. "Property" as 
described in this video basically means that  the plot of land is a sovereign 
nation. Well, sure, all it takes to start a  country is to say that your plot of 
land is a country, which is basically how  the United States started. However, 
it comes down to the fact that if someone  thinks that your "country" is part of 
theirs, then you have to kill anyone that  attempts to exert authority over it. 
<BR><BR>However this sounds in principle,  the fact is that if you actually try 
to assert any of these "rights" that  Badnarik says you have, you'll end up in 
jail if you're lucky and dead if you're  not, unless you have sufficient 
military resources to withstand an attack from  the US government. Not 
likely.<BR><BR>In short, the video may be informative in  the sense that you 
learn that you in fact have no rights as a citizen of the US,  but it's somewhat 
ridiculous to think that there's anything you can do about  it.</P>

 see this great class.  You'll learn a lot.  Michael is witty, and makes it 
 interesting.<BR><BR>(The complaint about Windows Media is bogus, I play them 
 fine on Linux... it's called mplayer, go download it.  Giving a video one star 
 because of it's format is ridiculous.  If the bogus reviewer would like to 
 convert to Real (which only just went 'free software'), feel free to upload it 
 for the rest of us)</P>

-     June 28, 2004  <BR><B>Subject:</B>  Portability  <BR>  This topic is one 
 long overdue for Americans. I have studied the Constitution for the past 30 
 years, and am shocked at the rampant ignorance, not only of  the average 
 layperson, but particularly of our elected representatives and even supreme 
 Court justices! Thumbs up to Michael Badnarik for providing this class.<BR>
Unfortunatly, the providers of this seven hour Constitution Class made the 
 mistaken asssumption that the entire world revolves around Micro$oft and its 
 proprietary `Windows Media Player'. Just as not everyone is a demopublican (or 
a  republicrat,) not everyone is a Micro$oft user. I myself use Linux, and 
cannot  run Micro$oft's Windows Media Player, since it is not portable  to other 
 operating systems.<BR>Perhaps Michael Badnarik will decide to make his class 
 available to everyone, including me, by using a more portable format like 
 RealPlayer, just to name one. When he does I'll be able to provide a much 
better  review.<BR>As it is, I give this class  only one star, because the file 
format  lacks OS-independent portability, leaving many people totally unable to 
see it.  Please try again Michael!</P></DIV></DIV>
