  <DIV class=c2>A satirical look at the Legal term "person."</DIV>
  <P><B>I am not a Person, or an Individual, or even a human</B><BR></P>
  <P>I am not a person, or an individual, or a Human, and although some humans 
  look similar to me, I am not a human.</P>
  <P>Some would say that I am a 'natural' person, but as I will show you, I am 
  not one of those either. Who then or what then am I?</P>
  <P>To understand who I am, you must first understand the definitions which 
  have been placed on the words I have quoted above, words that are commonly 
  used, but do not describe me anymore. For example, the word 'person'.</P>
  <P><B>Person -</B> <I>The Revised Code of Washington, RCW 1.16.080,</I> (I 
  live in Washington State) defines a person as follows: "The term 'person' may 
  be construed to include the United States, this state, or any state or 
  territory, or any public or private corporation, as well as an 
individual."</P>
  <P><B>Person -</B> <I>Black's Law Dictionary 6th Edition, pg. 791,</I> defines 
  'person' as follows: "In general usage, a human being (i.e. natural person), 
  though by statute term may include labor organizations, partnerships, 
  associations, corporations, legal representatives, trustees, trustees in 
  bankruptcy, or receivers."</P>
  <P><B>Person -</B> <I>Oran's Dictionary of the Law, West Group 1999,</I> 
  defines Person as: 1. A human being (a "natural" person). 2. A corporation (an 
  "artificial" person). Corporations are treated as persons in many legal 
  situations. Also, the word "person" includes corporations in most definitions 
  in this dictionary. 3. Any other "being" entitled to sue as a legal entity (a 
  government, an association, a group of Trustees, etc.). 4. The plural of 
  person is persons, not people (see that word). -</P>
  <P><B>Person -</B> <I>Duhaime's Law Dictionary.</I> An entity with legal 
  rights and existence including the ability to sue and be sued, to sign 
  contracts, to receive gifts, to appear in court either by themselves or by 
  lawyer and, generally, other powers incidental to the full expression of the 
  entity in law. Individuals are "persons" in law unless they are minors or 
  under some kind of other incapacity such as a court finding of mental 
  incapacity. Many laws give certain powers to "persons" which, in almost all 
  instances, includes business organizations that have been formally registered 
  such as partnerships, corporations or associations. -</P>
  <P><B>Person, noun. per'sn. -</B> <I>Webster's 1828 Dictionary.</I> Defines 
  person as: [Latin persona; said to be compounded of per, through or by, and 
  sonus, sound; a Latin word signifying primarily a mask used by actors on the 
  stage.]</P>
  <P><B>legal person -</B> <I>Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law 1996,</I> 
  defines a legal person as : a body of persons or an entity (as a corporation) 
  considered as having many of the rights and responsibilities of a natural 
  person and esp. the capacity to sue and be sued.</P>
  <P>A person according to these definitions, is basically an entity - legal 
  fiction - of some kind that has been legally created and has the legal 
  capacity to be sued. Isn't it odd that the word lawful is not used within 
  these definitions?</P>
  <P>Well….. I am not "the United States, this state, or any territory, or any 
  public or private corporation". I am not "labor organizations, partnerships, 
  associations, corporations, legal representatives, trustees, trustees in 
  bankruptcy, or receivers." So, I cannot be a 'person' under this part of the 
  definition.</P>
  <P>The RCW quoted above also states that a person could also be an 
  "individual". Black's Law Dictionary also defines a person as a "human being," 
  which they define by stating "(i.e. natural person)". So let's first check to 
  see if I am an "individual".</P>
  <P><B>Individual -</B> <I>Black's Law Dictionary 6th Edition, pg. 533,</I> 
  defines "individual" as follows: "As a noun, this term denotes a single person 
  as distinguished from a group or class, and also, very commonly, a private or 
  natural person as distinguished from a partnership, corporation, or 
  association; but it is said that this restrictive signification is not 
  necessarily inherent in the word, and that it may, in proper cases, include 
  artificial persons."</P>
  <P>Well now, I have already been shown that I am not a 'person', and since 
  'individual' denotes a single 'person' as distinguished from a group or class, 
  I can't be an 'individual' under this definition either. But I see the term 
  'natural person' used in the definition of the RCW, and also in the definition 
  of some of the Law Dictionaries. Maybe I am a 'natural' person, since I know I 
  am not an 'artificial' one.</P>
  <P>I could not find the term 'Natural person' defined anywhere, so I had to 
  look up the word 'natural' for a definition to see if that word would fit with 
  the word person...</P>
  <P><B>Natural -</B> <I>Black's Law Dictionary 6th Edition, pg. 712,</I> 
  defines 'Natural' as follows: "Untouched by man or by influences of 
  civilization; wild; untutored, and is the opposite of the word "artificial". 
  The juristic meaning of this term does not differ from the vernacular, except 
  in the cases where it is used in opposition to the term "legal"; and then it 
  means proceeding from or determined by physical causes or conditions, as 
  distinguished from positive enactments of law, or attributable to the nature 
  of man rather than the commands of law, or based upon moral rather than legal 
  considerations or sanctions."</P>
  <P>Wow, what do they mean by this definition? Am I untouched by man (depends 
  on what the word 'man' means), or by influences of civilization? I don't think 
  so. Am I 'wild', or 'untutored'? nope, not me. Even though the definition 
  states that this word is the opposite of the word 'artificial', it still does 
  not describe who I believe I am. So I must conclude that I am not a 'natural' 
  person, under this definition of the word 'natural'. So the term 'natural 
  person' cannot apply to me.</P>
  <P>Black's Law Dictionary also used the term 'human being', and although 
  Black's defined it as a 'natural person', maybe they made a mistake, maybe I 
  am a 'human being'. 'Human' or 'human being' does not appear to have a 'legal' 
  definition, so I went to my old standby 1888 Noah Webster's Dictionary for a 
  vernacular definition of this word. Maybe Noah would know who I am.</P>
  <P><B>Human -</B> <I>Webster's 1888 Dictionary defines 'human' as follows:</I> 
  n. A human being; one of the race of man. [Rare and inelegant.] "Sprung of 
  humans that inhabit earth." ...To me, the etymology of the word Hu-man, 
  suggests that it is a marriage of two separate words 'Hue' (defined as the 
  property of color), and man. But this cannot of course be correct, at least 
  not politically correct, so I can't go there, because the word would then mean 
  'colored man'!</P>
  <P>Am I of the race of man? Rare and inelegant? Sprung of humans that inhabit 
  earth (ground)? (I'm not colored either). Well, it looks like I have to define 
  the word 'man' through Webster's because there appears to be no legal 
  definition for 'man'.</P>
  <P><B>Man -</B> <I>Webster's 1888 Dictionary defines 'man' as follows:</I> An 
  individual of the human race; a human being; a person.</P>
  <P>Oh! Oh! Well, it looks like we are back to the beginning of our study of 
  definitions, yup, back to the start, completed the circle. I am not an 
  'individual', so I cannot be considered 'of the human race'; and since I'm not 
  of the human race, I can't be 'a human being', and I've also been shown that 
  I'm not 'a person' either.</P>
  <P>When I was younger, I remember filling out forms, which had the word 
  'Caucasian', listed for race (they don't seem to use that definition any more 
  for some reason). I was always told that this was the word for me to use since 
  I had white skin. (It is actually pinkish, and some is tanned, with mostly 
  white next to the tanned, but I was still told I was a 'Caucasian'). So back 
  to the definitions of 'Caucasian".</P>
  <P><B>Caucasian -</B> <I>Black's Law Dictionary 6th Edition, defines 
  'Caucasian' as follows:</I> Of or pertaining to the white race.</P>
  <P>Well, I guess that makes some sense, since I have always held myself to be 
  'white', but this is really not a very descriptive definition, so let's see 
  what an 'older' Black's Law Dictionary has to say, if anything (they have a 
  tendency to change the meaning of words in the new dictionaries for some 
  reason).</P>
  <P><B>Caucasian -</B> <I>Black's Law Dictionary 4th Edition,</I> defines 
  "Caucasian' As follows: Pertaining to the white race, to which belong the 
  greater part of European nations and those of western Asia. The term is 
  inapplicable to denote families or stocks inhabiting Europe and speaking 
  either the so-called Aryan or Semitic languages.</P>
  <P>That's interesting, it appears that 'white racist Aryan' groups, like 
  'Aryan Nations' types, or those speaking Aryan, are not even 'Caucasians' 
  under this definition, so they can't be from the 'White' Race (I wonder if 
  they know that). Neither are the people who call themselves Jews, and speak a 
  form of Hebrew (which appears to be derived from the older 'Semitic' language 
  referred to in Black's Law Dictionary).</P>
  <P>Back to Noah's Dictionary to see if he has a vernacular definition of the 
  word 'Caucasian'.</P>
  <P><B>Caucasian -</B> <I>Webster's 1888 Dictionary defines 'Caucasian' as 
  follows:</I> Anyone belonging to the Indo-European race, and the white races 
  originating near Mount Caucasus.</P>
  <P><B>OK, here is my Conclusion:</B> There may be some beings that are 
  'persons' and some of them are 'individuals', and some 'Natural persons' do 
  exist, of this I have no doubt, I've met some of them. There are also many 
  that I believe are 'Humans', or 'Human beings', these beings seem to exist all 
  over this globe. However...</P>
  <P>My kinfolk came from Western Europe, so I must have come from one of the 
  European Nations. I am also white (I use the term loosely), so by definition I 
  must be a 'Caucasian'. Since I am a Caucasian, I must have come from, or be a 
  member of one of the white races originating near Mount Caucasus. I am a male 
  of my race, so I must conclude that I am a 'Caucasian male'. I am also a 
  follower of the Hebrew Scriptures. I am a living breathing being, on the soil. 
  Therefore I must conclude that I am a living breathing Hebrew Caucasian 
  (White) male, in other words, I should be called a 'Living Breathing Hebrew 
  Caucasian Male'……. or an 'LBHCM' - Cool - Ok, now where is that Mount 
  Caucasus, and why would my Hebrew 'White' Race be originating from the area 
  near that mountain called Mount Caucasus ………<B>Hummmmmmmmmm??</B><BR><BR></P>
