<P>"Once jurisdiction is challenged, the court cannot proceed when it		clearly 
appears that the court lacks jurisdiction, the court has no authority		to reach 
merits, but, rather, should dismiss the action." <I>Melo</I> v.		<I>US</I>, 505 
F2d 1026. "There is no discretion to ignore that lack of		jurisdiction." 
<I>Joyce</I> v. <I>US</I>, 474 F2d 215. "The burden shifts to		the court to 
prove jurisdiction." <I>Rosemond</I> v. <I>Lambert</I>, 469 F2d		416. "Court 
must prove on the record, all jurisdiction facts related to the		jurisdiction 
asserted." <I>Lantana</I> v. <I>Hopper</I>, 102 F2d 188;		<I>Chicago</I> v. 
<I>New York</I>, 37 F Supp 150. "A universal principle as old		as the law is 
that a proceedings of a court without jurisdiction are a nullity		and its 
judgment therein without effect either on person or property."		<I>Norwood</I> 
v. <I>Renfield</I>, 34 C 329; <I>Ex parte Giambonini</I>, 49 P.		732. 
"Jurisdiction is fundamental and a judgment rendered by a court that does		not 
have jurisdiction to hear is void <I>ab initio</I>." <I>In Re Application		of 
Wyatt</I>, 300 P. 132; <I>Re Cavitt</I>, 118 P2d 846. "Thus, where a		judicial 
tribunal has no jurisdiction of the subject matter on which it assumes		to act, 
its proceedings are absolutely void in the fullest sense of the term."
		<I>Dillon</I> v. <I>Dillon</I>, 187 P 27. "A court has no jurisdiction to
		determine its own jurisdiction, for a basic issue in any case before a 
tribunal		is its power to act, and a court must have the authority to decide 
that		question in the first instance." <I>Rescue Army</I> v. <I>Municipal Court 
of		Los Angeles</I>, 171 P2d 8; 331 US 549, 91 L. ed. 1666, 67 S.Ct. 1409. "A
		departure by a court from those recognized and established requirements of 
law,		however close apparent adherence to mere form in method of procedure, 
which has		the effect of depriving one of a constitutional right, is an excess 
of		jurisdiction." <I>Wuest</I> v. <I>Wuest</I>, 127 P2d 934, 937. "Where a 
court		failed to observe safeguards, it amounts to denial of due process of law, 
court		is deprived of juris." <I>Merritt</I> v. <I>Hunter</I>, C.A. Kansas 170 
F2d		739. "the fact that the petitioner was released on a promise to appear 
before a		magistrate for an arraignment, that fact is circumstance to be 
considered in		determining whether in first instance there was a probable cause 
for the		arrest." <I>Monroe</I> v. <I>Papa</I>, DC, Ill. 1963, 221 F Supp 
685.</P>
<P>And, you may find this interesting as well:</P>
<P>"An action by Department of Motor Vehicles, whether directly or through		a 
court sitting administratively as the hearing officer, must be clearly		defined 
in the statute before it has subject matter jurisdiction, without such
		jurisdiction of the licensee, all acts of the agency, by its employees, 
agents,		hearing officers, are null and void." <I>Doolan</I> v. <I>Carr</I>, 125 
US 618;		<I>City</I> v <I>Pearson</I>, 181 Cal. 640. "Agency, or party sitting 
for the		agency, (which would be the magistrate of a municipal court) has no 
authority		to enforce as to any licensee unless he is acting for compensation. 
Such an act		is highly penal in nature, and should not be construed to include 
anything		which is not embraced within its terms. (Where) there is no charge 
within a		complaint that the accused was employed for compensation to do the act
		complained of, or that the act constituted part of a contract." <I>Schomig</I>
		v. <I>Kaiser</I>, 189 Cal 596. "When acting to enforce a statute and its
		subsequent amendments to the present date, the judge of the municipal court is
		acting as an administrative officer and not in a judicial capacity; courts in
		administering or enforcing statutes do not act judicially, but merely
		ministerially". <I>Thompson</I> v. <I>Smith</I>, 154 SE 583. "A judge ceases 
to		sit as a judicial officer because the governing principle of administrative 
law		provides that courts are prohibited from substituting their evidence,
		testimony, record, arguments, and rationale for that of the agency.
		Additionally, courts are prohibited from substituting their judgment for that
		of the agency. Courts in administrative issues are prohibited from even
		listening to or hearing arguments, presentation, or rational." <I>ASIS</I> v.
		<I>US</I>, 568 F2d 284. "Ministerial officers are incompetent to receive 
grants		of judicial power from the legislature, their acts in attempting to 
exercise		such powers are necessarily nullities." <I>Burns</I> v. <I>Sup. 
Ct.</I>, SF,		140 Cal. 1. "The elementary doctrine that the constitutionality of 
a		legislative act is open to attack only by persons whose rights are affected
		thereby, applies to statute relating to administrative agencies, the validity
		of which may not be called into question in the absence of a showing of
		substantial harm, actual or impending, to a legally protected interest 
directly		resulting from the enforcement of the statute." <I>Board of Trade</I> 
v.		<I>Olson</I>, 262 US 1; 29 ALR 2d 1051.</P>
