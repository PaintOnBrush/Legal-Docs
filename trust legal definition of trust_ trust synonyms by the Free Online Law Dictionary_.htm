      <DIV id="MainTxt">		 <SPAN class="hw">Trust</SPAN> 
      <P><I>A relationship created at the direction of an individual, in which 
      one or more persons hold the individual's property subject to certain 
      duties to use and protect it for the benefit of others.</I></P>
      <P>Individuals may control the distribution of their property during their 
      lives or after their deaths through the use of a trust. There are many 
      types of trusts and many purposes for their creation. A trust may be 
      created for the financial benefit of the person creating the trust, a 
      surviving spouse or minor children, or a charitable purpose. Though a 
      variety of trusts are permitted by law, trust arrangements that are 
      attempts to evade creditors or lawful responsibilities will be declared 
      void by the courts.</P>
      <P>The law of trusts is voluminous and often complicated, but generally it 
      is concerned with whether a trust has been created, whether it is a public 
      or private trust, whether it is legal, and whether the trustee has 
      lawfully managed the trust and trust property.</P>
      <H2>Basic Concepts</H2>
      <P>The person who creates the trust is the settlor. The person who holds 
      the property for another's benefit is the trustee. The person who is 
      benefited by the trust is the beneficiary, or <I>cestui que trust.</I> The 
      property that comprises the trust is the trust res, corpus, principal, or 
      subject matter. For example, a parent signs over certain stock to a bank 
      to manage for a child, with instructions to give the dividend checks to 
      him each year until he becomes 21 years of age, at which time he is to 
      receive all the stock. The parent is the settlor, the bank is the trustee, 
      the stock is the trust res, and the child is the beneficiary.</P>
      <P>A fiduciary relationship exists in the law of trusts whenever the 
      settlor relies on the trustee and places special confidence in her. The 
      trustee must act in <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Good+Faith">Good 
      Faith</A> with strict honesty and due regard to protect and serve the 
      interests of the beneficiaries. The trustee also has a fiduciary 
      relationship with the beneficiaries of the trust.</P>
      <P>A trustee takes legal title to the trust res, which means that the 
      trustee's interest in the property appears to be one of complete ownership 
      and possession, but the trustee does not have the right to receive any 
      benefits from the property. The right to benefit from the property, known 
      as equitable title, belongs to the beneficiary.</P>
      <P>The terms of the trust are the duties and powers of the trustee and the 
      rights of the beneficiary conferred by the settlor when he created the 
      trust.</P>
      <P>State statutes and court decisions govern the law of trusts. The 
      validity of a trust of real property is determined by the law of the state 
      where the property is located. The law of the state of the permanent 
      residence (domicile) of the settlor frequently governs a trust of <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Personal+Property">Personal 
      Property</A>, but courts also consider a number of factors—such as the 
      intention of the settlor, the state where the settlor lives, the state 
      where the trustee lives, and the location of the trust property—when 
      deciding which state has the greatest interest in regulating the trust 
      property.</P>
      <P>As a general rule, personal property can be held in a trust created 
      orally. Express trusts of real property, however, must be in writing to be 
      enforced. When a person creates a trust in his will, the resulting 
      testamentary trust will be valid only if the will itself conforms to the 
      requirements of state law for wills. Some states have adopted all or part 
      of the <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Uniform+Probate+Code">Uniform 
      Probate Code</A>, which governs both wills and testamentary trusts.</P>
      <H2>Private Trusts</H2>
      <P>An express trust is created when the settlor expresses an intention 
      either orally or in writing to establish the trust and complies with the 
      required formalities. An express trust is what people usually mean when 
      they refer to a trust.</P>
      <P>Every private trust consists of four distinct elements: an intention of 
      the settlor to create the trust, a res or subject matter, a trustee, and a 
      beneficiary. Unless these elements are present, a court cannot enforce an 
      arrangement as a trust.</P>
      <P><B>Intention</B> The settlor must intend to impose enforceable duties 
      on a trustee to deal with the property for the benefit of another. Intent 
      can be demonstrated by words, conduct, or both. It is immaterial whether 
      the word <I>trust</I> is used in the trust document. Sometimes, however, 
      the words used by the settlor are equivocal and there is doubt whether the 
      settlor intended to create a trust. If the settlor uses words that express 
      merely the desire to do something, such as the terms <I>desire, wish</I>, 
      or <I>hope</I>, these precatory words (words expressing a wish) may create 
      a moral obligation, but they do not create a legal one. In this situation 
      a court will consider the entire document and the circumstances of the 
      person who attempted to create the trust to determine whether a trust 
      should be established.</P>
      <P>The settlor must intend to create a present trust. Demonstrating an 
      intent to create a trust in the future is legally ineffective. When a 
      settlor does not immediately designate the beneficiary, the trustee, or 
      the trust property, a trust is not created until the designations are 
      made.</P>
      <P><B>Res or Subject Matter</B> An essential element of every trust is the 
      trust property or res. Property must exist and be definite or definitely 
      ascertainable at the time the trust is created and throughout its 
      existence. Although stocks, bonds, and deeds are the most common types of 
      trust property, any property interest that can be freely transferred by 
      the settlor can be held in trust, including <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Patents">Patents</A>, 
      copyrights, and <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Trademarks">Trademarks</A>. 
      A mere expectancy—the anticipation of receiving a gift by will, for 
      example—cannot be held in trust for another because no property interest 
      exists at that time.</P>
      <P>If the subject matter of a trust is totally destroyed, the trust ends. 
      The beneficiary might have a claim against the trustee for breach of 
      trust, however, if the trustee was negligent in failing to insure the 
      trust property. If insurance proceeds are paid as a result of the 
      destruction, the trust should be administered from them.</P>
      <P><B>Trustee</B> Any person who has the legal capacity to take, hold, and 
      administer property for her own use can take, hold, and administer 
      property in trust. Nonresidents of the state in which the trust is to be 
      administered can be trustees. State law determines whether an alien can 
      act as a trustee.A corporation can act as a trustee. For example, a trust 
      company is a bank that has been named by a settlor to act as trustee in 
      managing a trust. A partnership can serve as a trustee if state law 
      permits. An unincorporated association, such as a <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Labor+Union">Labor 
      Union</A> or social club, usually cannot serve as a trustee.</P>
      <P>The United States, a state, or a <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Municipal+Corporation">Municipal 
      Corporation</A> can take and hold property as trustee. This arrangement 
      usually occurs when a settlor creates a trust for the benefit of a 
      military academy or a state college, or when the settlor sets aside 
      property as a park for the community.</P>
      <P>The failure of a settlor to name a trustee does not void a trust. The 
      court appoints a trustee to administer the trust and orders the person 
      having legal title to the property to convey it to the appointed 
      trustee.</P>
      <P>If two or more trustees are appointed, they always hold the title to 
      trust property in <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Joint+Tenancy">Joint 
      Tenancy</A> with the <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Right+of+Survivorship">Right 
      of Survivorship</A>. If one joint tenant dies, the surviving joint tenant 
      inherits the entire interest, not just her proportionate share.</P>
      <P>A trustee cannot resign without the permission of the court unless the 
      trust instrument so provides or unless all of the beneficiaries who are 
      legally capable to do so consent to the resignation. The court usually 
      permits the trustee to resign if continuing to serve will be an 
      unreasonable burden for the trustee and the resignation will not be 
      greatly detrimental to the trust.</P>
      <P>The removal of a trustee is within the discretion of the court. A 
      trustee can be removed for habitual drunkenness, dishonesty, <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Incompetency">Incompetency</A> 
      in handling trust property, or the dissipation of the trustee estate. Mere 
      friction or incompatibility between the trustee and the beneficiary is 
      insufficient, however, to justify removal unless it endangers the trust 
      property or makes the accomplishment of the trust impossible.</P>
      <P><B>Beneficiary</B> Every private trust must have a designated 
      beneficiary or one so described that his identity can be learned when the 
      trust is created or within the time limit of the <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Rule+against+Perpetuities">Rule 
      against Perpetuities</A>, which is usually measured by the life of a 
      person alive or conceived at the time the trust is created plus 21 years. 
      This <A 
      href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Rule+of+Law">Rule of 
      Law</A>, which varies from state to state, is designed to prevent a person 
      from tying up property in a trust for an unlimited number of years.</P>
      <P>A person or corporation legally capable of taking and holding legal 
      title to property can be a beneficiary of a trust. Partnerships and 
      unincorporated associations can also be beneficiaries. Unless restricted 
      by law, <A 
      href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Aliens">Aliens</A> can 
      also be beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>A class of persons can be named the beneficiary of a trust as long as 
      the class is definite or definitely ascertainable. If property is left in 
      trust for "my children," the class is definite and the trust is valid. 
      When a trust is designated "for my family," the validity of the trust 
      depends on whether the court construes the term to mean immediate 
      family—in which case the class is definite—or all relations. If the latter 
      is meant, the trust will fail because the class is indefinite.</P>
      <P>When an ascertainable class exists, a settlor may grant the trustee the 
      right to select beneficiaries from that class. However, a trust created 
      for the benefit of any person selected by the trustee is not 
      enforceable.</P>
      <P>If the settlor's designation of an individual beneficiary or a class of 
      beneficiaries is so vague or indefinite that the individual or group 
      cannot be determined with reasonable clarity, the trust will fail.</P>
      <P>The beneficiaries of a trust hold their equitable interest as tenants 
      in common unless the trust instrument provides that they shall hold as 
      joint tenants. For example, three beneficiaries each own an undivided 
      one-third of the equitable title in the trust property. If they take as 
      tenants in common, upon their deaths their heirs will inherit their 
      proportionate shares. If, however, the settlor specified in the trust 
      document that they are to take as joint tenants, then upon the death of 
      one, the two beneficiaries will divide his share. Upon the death of one of 
      the remaining two, the lone survivor will enjoy the complete benefits of 
      the trust.</P>
      <H2>Creation of Express Trusts</H2>
      <P>To create an express trust, the settlor must own or have <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Power+of+Attorney">Power 
      of Attorney</A> over the property that is to become the trust property or 
      must have the power to create such property. The settlor must be legally 
      competent to create a trust.</P>
      <P>A trust cannot be created for an illegal purpose, such as to defraud 
      creditors or to deprive a spouse of her rightful elective share. The 
      purpose of a trust is considered illegal when it is aimed at accomplishing 
      objectives contrary to public policy. For example, a trust provision that 
      encourages <A 
      href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Divorce">Divorce</A>, 
      prevents a marriage, or violates the rule against perpetuities generally 
      will not be enforced.</P>
      <P>If the illegal provision pertains to the whole trust, the trust fails 
      in its entirety. If, however, it does not affect the entire trust, only 
      the illegal provision is stricken, and the trust is given effect without 
      it.</P>
      <H2>Methods of Creation</H2>
      <P>A trust may be created by an express declaration of trust, a transfer 
      in trust made either during a settlor's lifetime or under her will, an 
      exercise of the power of appointment, a contractual arrangement, or 
      statute. The method used for creating the trust depends on the 
      relationship of the settlor to the property interest that is to constitute 
      the trust property.</P>
      <P><B>Declaration of Trust</B> A trust is created by a declaration of 
      trust when the owner of property announces that she holds it as a trustee 
      for the benefit of another. There is no need for a transfer because the 
      trustee already has legal title. An oral declaration is usually sufficient 
      to transfer equitable title to personal property, but a written 
      declaration is usually required with respect to real property.</P>
      <P><B>Trust Transfers</B> A trust is created when property is transferred 
      in trust to a trustee for the benefit of another or even for the benefit 
      of the settlor. Legal title passes to the trustee, and the beneficiary 
      receives equitable title in the property. The settlor has no remaining 
      interest in the property. A transfer in trust can be executed by a deed or 
      some other arrangement during the settlor's lifetime. This is known as an 
      inter vivos trust or living trust.</P>
      <P><B>Powers of Appointment</B> A power of appointment is the right that 
      one person, called the donor, gives in a deed or a will to another, the 
      donee, to "appoint" or select individuals, the appointees, who should 
      benefit from the donor's will, deed, or trust. A person holding a general 
      power of appointment can create a trust according to the donor's direction 
      by appointing a person as trustee to hold the trust property for anyone, 
      including herself or her estate. If that person holds a special power of 
      appointment, she cannot appoint herself.</P>
      <P><B>Contracts</B> Trusts can be created by various types of contractual 
      arrangements. For example, a person can take out a life insurance policy 
      on his own life and pay the premiums on the policy.</P>
      <P>The insurer, in return, promises to pay the proceeds of the policy to 
      an individual who is to act as a trustee for an individual named by the 
      insured. The trustee is given the duty to support the beneficiary of this 
      trust from the proceeds during the beneficiary's life. The insured as 
      settlor creates a trust by entering into a contract with the insurance 
      company in favor of a trustee. The trust, called an insurance trust, is 
      created when the insurance company issues its policy.</P>
      <P><B>Statute</B> Statutes provide for the creation of trusts in various 
      instances. In the case of <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Wrongful+Death">Wrongful 
      Death</A>, statutes often provide that a right of action exists in the 
      surviving spouse or executor or administrator of the decedent with any 
      recovery held in trust for the designated beneficiaries.</P>
      <H2>Protection of Beneficiary's Interest from Creditors</H2>
      <P>Various trust devices have been developed to protect a beneficiary's 
      interest from creditors. The most common are spendthrift trusts, 
      discretionary trusts, and support trusts. Such devices safeguard the trust 
      property while the trustee retains it. Once funds have been paid to the 
      beneficiary, however, any attempt at imposing restraint on the 
      transferability of his interest is invalid.</P>
      <P><B>Spendthrift Trusts</B> A <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Spendthrift+Trust">Spendthrift 
      Trust</A> is one in which, because of either a direction of the settlor or 
      statute, the beneficiary is unable to transfer his right to future 
      payments of income or capital, and creditors are unable to obtain the 
      beneficiary's interest in future distributions from the trust for the 
      payment of debts. Such trusts are ordinarily created with the aim of 
      providing a fund for the maintenance of another, known as the spendthrift, 
      while at the same time protecting the trust against the beneficiary's 
      shortsightedness, extravagance, and inability to manage his financial 
      affairs. Such trusts do not restrict creditors' rights to the property 
      after the beneficiary receives it, but the creditors cannot compel the 
      trustee to pay them directly.</P>
      <P>The majority of states authorize spendthrift trusts. Those that do not 
      will void such provisions so that the beneficiary can transfer his rights 
      and creditors can reach the right to future income.</P>
      <P><B>Discretionary Trusts</B> A discretionary trust authorizes the 
      trustee to pay to the beneficiary only as much of the income or capital of 
      the trust as the trustee sees fit to use for that purpose, with the 
      remaining income or capital reserved for another purpose. This discretion 
      allows the trustee to give the beneficiary some benefits under the trust 
      or to give her nothing. The beneficiary cannot force the trustee to use 
      any of the trust property for the beneficiary's benefit. Such a trust 
      gives the beneficiary no interest that can be transferred or reached by 
      creditors until the trustee has decided to pay or apply some of the trust 
      property for the beneficiary.</P>
      <P><B>Support Trusts</B> A trust that directs that the trustee shall pay 
      or apply only so much of the income and principal as is necessary for the 
      education and support of a beneficiary is a support trust. The interest of 
      the beneficiary cannot be transferred. Paying money to an assignee of the 
      beneficiary or to creditors would defeat the objectives of the trust. 
      Support trusts are used, for the most part, in jurisdictions that prohibit 
      spendthrift trusts.</P>
      <H2>Charitable Trusts</H2>
      <P>The purpose of a <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Charitable+Trust">Charitable 
      Trust</A> is to accomplish a substantial social benefit for some portion 
      of the public. The law favors charitable trusts by according them certain 
      privileges, such as an advantageous tax status. Before a court will 
      enforce a charitable trust, however, it must examine the alleged charity 
      and evaluate its social benefits. The court cannot rely on the settlor's 
      view that the trust is charitable.</P>
      <P>To be valid, a charitable trust must meet certain requirements. The 
      settlor must have the intent to create a charitable trust, there must be a 
      trustee to administer the trust, which consists of some trust property, 
      and the charitable purpose must be expressly designated. The beneficiary 
      must be a definite segment of the community composed of indefinite 
      persons. Selected persons within the class must actually receive the 
      benefit. The requirements of intention, trustee, and res in a charitable 
      trust are the same as those in a private trust.</P>
      <P><B>Charitable Purpose</B> A charitable purpose is one that benefits, 
      improves, or uplifts humankind mentally, morally, or physically. The 
      relief of poverty, the improvement of government, and the advancement of 
      religion, education, or health are some examples of charitable 
      purposes.</P>
      <P><B>Beneficiaries</B> The class to be benefited in a charitable trust 
      must be a definite segment of the public. It must be large enough so that 
      the community in general is affected and has an interest in the 
      enforcement of the trust, yet it must not include the entire human race. 
      Within the class, however, the specific persons to benefit must be 
      indefinite. A trust "for the benefit of orphans of veterans of the 1991 
      Gulf War" is charitable because the class or category of beneficiaries is 
      definite. The indefinite persons within the class are the individuals 
      ultimately selected by the trustee to receive the provided benefit.</P>
      <P>A trust for designated persons or a trust for profit cannot be a 
      charitable trust. A trust to "erect and maintain a hospital" might be 
      charitable even though the hospital charges the patients who are served, 
      provided that any profits are used solely to continue the charitable 
      services of the hospital.</P>
      <P>As a general rule, a charitable trust may last forever, unlike a 
      private trust. In a private trust, the designated beneficiary is the 
      proper person to enforce the trust. In a charitable trust, the state 
      attorney general, who represents the public interest, is the proper person 
      to enforce the trust.</P>
      <P><B>Cy Pres Doctrine</B> The doctrine of <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Cy+Pres">Cy 
      Pres</A>, taken from the phrase <I>cy pres comme possible</I> (French for 
      "as near as possible"), refers to the power of a court to change 
      administrative provisions in a charitable trust when the settlor's 
      directions hinder the trustee in accomplishing the trust purpose. A court 
      also has the power under the cy pres doctrine to order the trust funds to 
      be applied to a charitable purpose other than the one named by the 
      settlor. This will occur if it has become impossible, impractical, or 
      inexpedient to accomplish the settlor's charitable purpose. Because a 
      charitable trust can last forever, many purposes become obsolete because 
      of changing economic, social, political, or other conditions. For example, 
      a trust created in 1930 to combat smallpox would be of little practical 
      value today because medical advances have virtually eliminated the 
      disease. When the cy pres doctrine is applied, the court reasons that the 
      settlor would have wanted her general charitable purposes implemented 
      despite the changing conditions.</P>
      <P>The cy pres doctrine can be applied only by a court, never by the 
      trustees of the trust, who must execute the terms of the trust. Trustees 
      can apply to the court, however, for cy pres instructions when they 
      believe that the trust arrangements warrant it.</P>
      <H2>Management</H2>
      <P>The terms of a trust instrument, when a writing is required, or the 
      statements of a settlor, when she creates a trust, set specific powers or 
      duties that the trustee has in administering the trust property. These 
      express powers, which are unequivocal and directly granted to the trustee, 
      frequently consist of the power to sell the original trust property, 
      invest the proceeds of any property sold, and collect the income of the 
      trust property and pay it to the beneficiaries. The trustee also has 
      implied powers that the settlor is deemed to have intended because they 
      are necessary to fulfill the purposes of the trust.</P>
      <P>A settlor can order the trustee to perform a certain act during the 
      administration of the trust, such as selling trust realty as soon as 
      possible and investing the proceeds in bonds. This power to sell is a 
      mandatory or an imperative power. If the trustee fails to execute this 
      power, he has committed a breach of trust. The beneficiary can obtain a 
      court order compelling the trustee to perform the act, or the court can 
      order the trustee to pay damages for delaying or failing to use the power. 
      The court can also remove the trustee and appoint one who will exercise 
      the power.</P>
      <P>Courts usually will not set aside the decision of a trustee as long as 
      the trustee made the decision in good faith after considering the 
      settlor's intended purpose of the trust and the circumstances of the 
      beneficiaries. A court will not tell a trustee how to exercise his 
      discretionary powers. It will only direct the trustee to use his own 
      judgment. If, however, the trustee refuses to do so or does so in bad 
      faith or arbitrarily, a beneficiary can seek court intervention.</P>
      <P>A trustee, as a fiduciary, must administer the trust with the skill and 
      prudence that any reasonable and careful person would use in conducting 
      her own financial affairs. The trustee's actions must conform to the trust 
      purposes. Failure to act in this manner will render a trustee liable for 
      breach of trust, regardless of whether she acted in good faith.</P>
      <P>A trustee must be loyal to the beneficiaries, administering the trust 
      solely for their benefit and to the exclusion of any considerations of 
      personal profit or advantage. A trustee would violate her fiduciary duty 
      and demonstrate a conflict of interest if, for example, she sold trust 
      property to herself.</P>
      <P>A trustee has the duty to defend the trust and the interests of the 
      beneficiaries against baseless claims that the trust is invalid. If the 
      claim is valid, however, and it would be useless to defend against such a 
      challenge, the trustee should accede to the claim to avoid any unnecessary 
      waste of property.</P>
      <P>Trust property must be designated as such and segregated from a 
      trustee's individual property and from property the trustee might hold in 
      trust for others. This requirement enables a trustee to properly maintain 
      the property and allows the beneficiary to easily trace it in the event of 
      the trustee's death or insolvency.</P>
      <P>Generally, a trustee is directed to collect and distribute income and 
      has the duty to invest the trust property in income-producing assets as 
      soon as is reasonable. This duty of investment is controlled by the 
      settlor's directions in the trust document, court orders, the consent of 
      the beneficiaries, or statute. Some states have statutes that list various 
      types of investments that a trustee may or must make. Such laws are known 
      as legal list statutes.</P>
      <P>One of the principal duties of a trustee is to make payments of income 
      and distribute the trust principal according to the terms of the trust, 
      unless otherwise directed by a court. Unless a settlor expressly reserves 
      such power when creating the trust, she cannot modify its payment 
      provisions. In addition, the trustee cannot alter the terms of payment 
      without obtaining approval of all the beneficiaries. Courts are empowered 
      to permit the trustee to deviate from the trust terms with respect to the 
      time and the form of payment, but the relative size of the beneficiaries' 
      interests cannot be changed. If a beneficiary is in dire need of funds, 
      courts will accelerate the payment. This is called "hastening the 
      enjoyment."</P>
      <H2>Revocation or Modification</H2>
      <P>The creation of a trust is actually a conveyance of the settlor's 
      property, usually as a gift. A trust cannot be cancelled or set aside at 
      the option of the settlor should the settlor change his mind or become 
      dissatisfied with the trust, unless the trust instrument so provides. If 
      the settlor reserves the power to revoke or modify only in a particular 
      manner, he can do so only in that manner. Otherwise, the revocation or 
      modification can be accomplished in any manner that sufficiently 
      demonstrates the settlor's intention to revoke or modify.</P>
      <H2>Termination</H2>
      <P>The period of time for which a trust is to operate is usually expressly 
      prescribed in the trust instrument. A settlor can state that the trust 
      shall last until the beneficiary reaches a particular age or until the 
      beneficiary marries. When this period expires, the trust ends.</P>
      <P>When the duration of a trust is not expressly fixed, the basic rule is 
      that a trust will last no longer than necessary for the accomplishment of 
      its purpose. A trust to educate a person's grandchildren would terminate 
      when their education is completed. A trust also concludes when its 
      purposes become impossible or illegal.</P>
      <P>When all the beneficiaries and the settlor join in applying to the 
      court to have the trust terminated, it will be ended even though the 
      purposes that the settlor originally contemplated have not been 
      accomplished. If the settlor does not join in the action, and if one or 
      more of the purposes of the trust can still be attained by continuing the 
      trust, the majority of U.S. courts refuse to grant a decree of 
      termination. Testamentary trusts cannot be terminated.</P>

      <HR>

      <P><SPAN class="hw">trust</SPAN> n. an entity created to hold assets for 
      the benefit of certain persons or entities, with a trustee managing the 
      trust (and often holding title on behalf of the trust).  Most trusts are 
      founded by the persons (called trustors, settlors and/or donors) who 
      execute a written Declaration of Trust which establishes the trust and 
      spells out the terms and conditions upon which it will be conducted.  The 
      Declaration also names the original trustee or trustees, successor 
      trustees, or means to choose future trustees.  The assets of the trust are 
      usually given to the trust by the creators, although assets may be added 
      by others.  During the life of the trust, profits and, sometimes, a 
      portion of the principal (called "corpus") may be distributed to the 
      beneficiaries, and at some time in the future (such as the death of the 
      last trustor or settlor) the remaining assets will be distributed to 
      beneficiaries.  A trust may take the place of a will and avoid probate 
      (management of an estate with court supervision) by providing for 
      distribution of all assets originally owned by the trustors or settlors, 
      upon their death.  There are numerous types of trusts, including revocable 
      trusts created to handle the trustors' assets (with the trustor acting as 
      initial trustee), often called a "living trust" (or "inter vivos trust") 
      which only becomes irrevocable on the death of the first trustor; 
      "irrevocable trust" which cannot be changed at any time, "charitable 
      remainder unitrust" which provides for eventual guaranteed distribution of 
      the corpus (assets) to charity, thus gaining a substantial tax benefit.  
      There are also court-decreed "constructive" and "resulting" trusts over 
      property held by someone for its owner.  A "testamentary trust" can be 
      created by a will to manage assets given to beneficiaries.  (See: <A href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/living%20trust">living

      <HR>

      <P>TRUST, contracts, devises. An equitable right, title or interest in 
       property, real or personal, distinct from its legal ownership; or it is a 
       personal obligation for paying, delivering or performing anything, where 
      the  person trusting has no real. right or security, for by, that act he 
      confides  altogether to the faithfulness of those entrusted. This is its 
      most general  meaning, and includes deposits, bailments, and the like. In 
      its more  technical sense, it may be defined to be an obligation upon a 
      person,  arising out of a confidence reposed in him, to apply property 
      faithfully,  and according to such confidence. Willis on Trustees, 1; 4 
      Kent, Com. 295; 2  Fonb. Eq. 1; 1 Saund. Uses and Tr. 6; Coop. Eq. Pl. 
      Introd. 27; 3 Bl. Com.  431.  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Trusts were 
      probably derived from the civil law. The fidei  commissum, (q.v.) is not 
      dissimilar to a trust.  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Trusts are either 
      express or implied. 1st. Express trusts are those  which are created in 
      express terms in the deed, writing or will. The terms  to create an 
      express trust will be sufficient, if it can be fairly collected  upon the 
      face of the instrument that a trust was intended. Express trusts  are 
      usually found in preliminary sealed agreements, such as marriage 
       articles, or articles for the purchase of land; in formal conveyances, 
      such  as marriage settlements, terms for years, mortgages, assignments for 
      the  payment of debts, raising portions or other purposes; and in wills 
      and  testaments, when the bequests involve fiduciary interests for private 
       benefit or public charity,, they may be created even by parol. 6 Watts 
      &amp;  Serg. 97.  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.-2d. Implied trusts are 
      those which without being expressed, are  deducible from the nature of the 
      transaction, as matters of intent; or which  are superinduced upon the 
      transaction by operation of law, as matters of  equity, independently of 
      the particular intention of the parties.  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. 
      The most common form of an implied trust is where property or money  is 
      delivered by one person to another, to be by the latter delivered to a 
       third person. These implied trusts greatly extend over the business and 
       pursuits of men: a few examples will be given.  
      <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When land is purchased by one man in the 
      name of another, and the  former pays the consideration money, the land 
      will in general be held by the  grantee in Trust for the person who so 
      paid the consideration money. Com.  Dig. Chancery, 3 W 3; 2 Fonb. Eq. book 
      2, c. 5, Sec. 1, note a. Story, Eq.  Jur. Sec. 1201.  
      <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. When real property is purchased out of 
      partnership funds, and the  title is taken in the name of one of the 
      partners, he will hold it in trust  for all the partners. 7 Ves. jr. 453; 
      Montague on Partn. 97, n.; Colly.  Partn. 68.  
      <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. When a contract is made for the sale of 
      land, in equity the vendor  is immediately deemed a trustee for the vendee 
      of the estate; and the  vendee, a trustee for the vendor of the purchase 
      money; and by this means  there is an equitable conversion of the 
      property. 1 Fonb. Eq. book 1, ch. 6,  Sec. 9, note t; Story, Eq. Jur. SSSS 
      789, 790, 1212. See Conversion. For the  origin of trusts in the civil 
      law, see 5 Toull. Dr. Civ. Fr. liv. 3, t. 2,  c. 1, n. 18; 1 Brown's Civ. 
      Law, 190. Vide Resulting Trusts. See, generally,  Bouv. Inst. Index, 
      h.t.</P>
