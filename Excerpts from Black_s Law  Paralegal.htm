<H2>Excerpts from Black’s Law Dictionary</H2>
<P>Here is an extensive list of excerpts from Black’s Law Dictionary from 
A-Z.&nbsp; This will help you understand a good amount of the most widely used 
terminology in the legal system.&nbsp; Please refer to our other valuable 
resources as a guide as you continue your legal studies.</P>
<P>Founded by Henry Campbell Black and first published in 1891, “Black’s Law 
Dictionary” is the most widely used law dictionary in the United States. It is 
the most widely used reference for definitions in court opinions and legal 
briefs, and has been cited as a secondary legal authority in U.S. Supreme Court 
cases. It is an essential tool for the layman and student when they need to look 
up legal terms.&nbsp; The most recent edition, the ninth edition, was published 
in the summer of 2009. This article aims to offer a selection of terms and 
definitions from Black’s Law Dictionary.</P>
<P><STRONG>Assistance of Counsel -</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>Sixth Amendment to 
Federal Constitution, guaranteeing accused in criminal prosecution “assistance 
of counsel” for his defense, means effective assistance, as distinguished from 
bad faith, sham, mere pretense or want of opportunity for conferences and 
preparation. Fed.R.Crim.P. 44; 18 U.S.C.A. § 3006A; Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 
U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799; Gedes v. U.S., 425 U.S. 80, 965 S.Ct. 
1330, 47 L.Ed.2d 592. See Assigned counsel; Counsel, right to; Miranda Rule.</P>
<P><STRONG>Bill of exchange.</STRONG> An unconditional order in writing 
addressed by one person to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring 
the person to whom it is addressed to pay on demand or at a fixed or 
determinable future time a sum certain in money. A three party instrument in 
which first party draws an order for the payment of a sum certain on a second 
party for payment to a third party at a definite future time. Same as “draft” 
under V.C.C. A check is a demand bill of exchange. See also Advance bill; 
Banker’s acceptance; Blank bill; Clean bill; Draft; Time (Time bill).</P>
<P><STRONG>Bill of Rights</STRONG> -A formal and emphatic legislative assertion 
and declaration of popular rights and liberties usually promulgated upon a 
change of government; e.g. the famous Bill of Rights of 1688 in English history. 
Also the summary of the rights and liberties of the people, or of the principles 
of constitutional law deemed essential and fundamental, contained in many of the 
American state constitutions. Hamill v. Hawks, C.C.A. Okl., 58 F.2d 41, 47. That 
portion of Constitution guaranteeing rights and privileges to the individual; 
i.e. first ten Amendments of U.S. Constitution.</P>
<P><STRONG>Cede -</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>To yield up; to assign; to grant; to 
surrender; to withdraw. Generally used to designate the transfer of territory 
from one government to another.</P>
<P><STRONG>Citizen</STRONG>- One who, under the Constitution and laws of the 
United States, or of a particular state, is a member of the political community, 
owing allegiance and being entitled to the enjoyment of full civil rights. All 
persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the 
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein 
they reside. U.S.Const., 14th Amend.&nbsp;<EM>See</EM><EM> 
</EM><EM>Citizenship</EM><EM> </EM>.</P>
<P>“Citizens” are members of a political community who, in their associated 
capacity, have established or submitted themselves to the dominion of a 
government for the promotion of their general welfare and the protection of 
their individual as well as collective rights. Herriott v. City of Seattle, 81 
Wash.2d 48, 500 P.2d 101, 109.</P>
<P>The term may include or apply to children of alien parents born in United 
States, Von Schwerdtner v. Piper, D.C.Md., 23 F.2d 862, 863; U. S. v. Minoru 
Yasui, D.C.Or., 48 F.Supp. 40, 54; children of American citizens born outside 
United States, Haaland v. Attorney General of United States, D.C.Md., 42 F.Supp. 
13, 22; Indians, United States v. Hester, C.C.A.Okl., 137 F.2d 145, 147; 
National Banks, American Surety Co. v. Bank of California, C.C.A.Or., 133 F.2d 
160, 162; nonresident who has qualified as administratrix of estate of deceased 
resident, Hunt v. Noll, C.C.A.Tenn., 112 F.2d 288, 289. However, neither the 
United States nor a state is a citizen for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. 
Jizemerjian v. Dept. of Air Force, 457 F.Supp. 820. On the other hand, 
municipalities and other local governments are deemed to be citizens. Rieser v. 
District of Columbia, 563 F.2d 462. A corporation is not a citizen for purposes 
of privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. D. D. B. Realty 
Corp. v. Merrill, 232 F.SUPP. 629, 637. Under the diversity statute, which 
mirrors U.S. Const Article lII’s diversity clause, a person is a “citizen of a 
state” if he or she is a citizen of the United States and a domiciliary of a 
state of the United States. Gibbons v. Udaras na Gaeltachta, D.C.N.Y., 549 
F.Supp. 1094, 1116.</P>
<P><STRONG>Citizenship</STRONG> – The status of being a citizen. There are four 
ways to acquire citizenship: by birth in the United States, by birth in U.S. 
territories, by birth outside the U.S. to U.S. parents, and by 
naturalization.&nbsp;<EM>See Corporate citizenship; Diversity of citizenship; 
Dual citizenship; Federal citizenship; Naturalization; Jus sanguinis; Jus 
soli.</EM></P>
<P><STRONG>Color of law -</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>The appearance of semblance, 
without the substance, of legal right. Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of 
state law and made possible only because wrongdoer is clothed with authority of 
state, is action taken under “color of state law.” Atkins v. Lanning, D.C.Okl., 
415 F.Supp. 186, 188</P>
<P>When used in the context of federal civil rights statutes or criminal law, 
the term is synonymous with the concept of “state action” under the Fourteenth 
Amendment Timson v. Weiner, D.C.Ohio, 395 F.Supp. 1344, 1347; and means pretense 
of law and includes actions of officers who undertake to perform their official 
duties, Thompson v. Baker, D.C.Ark., 133 F.Supp. 247; 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983. See 
Tort (Constitutional Tort).</P>
<P>Action taken by private individuals may be “under color of state law” for 
purposes of 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983 governing deprivation of civil rights when 
significant state involvement attaches to action. Wagner v. Metropolitan 
Nashville Airport Authority, C.A.Tenn., 772 F.2d 227, 229.</P>
<P>Acts “under color of any law” of a State include not only acts done by State 
officials within the bounds or limits of their lawful authority, but also acts 
done without and beyond their lawful authority, but also acts done without and 
beyond the bounds of their lawful authority; provided that , in order for 
unlawful acts of an official to be “under color of any law”, the unlawful acts 
must be done while such official is purporting or pretending to act in the 
performance of his official duties; that is to say, the unlawful acts must 
consist in an abuse or misuse of power which is possessed by the official only 
because he is an official; and the unlawful acts must be of such a nature or 
character, and be committed under such circumstances, that they would not have 
occurred but for the fact that the person committing them was an official then 
and there exercising his official power outside the bounds of lawful authority. 
42 U.S.C.A. § 1983.</P>
<P><STRONG>Commonwealth.</STRONG> The public or common weal or welfare. This 
cannot be regarded as a technical term of public law, though often used in 
political science. It generally designates, when so employed, a republican frame 
of government,-one in which the welfare and rights of the entire mass of people 
are the main consideration, rather than the privileges of a class or the will of 
a monarch; or it may designate the body of citizens living under such a 
government.</P>
<P>Sometimes it may denote the corporate entity, or the government, of a jural 
society (or state) possessing powers of self-government in respect of its 
immediate concerns, but forming an integral part of a larger government (or 
nation). In this latter sense, it is the official title of several of the United 
States (as Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Kentucky), and would be 
appropriate to them all. In the former sense, the word was used to designate the 
English government during the protectorate of Cromwell.</P>
<P>Any of the individual States of the United States and the body of people 
constituting a state or politically organized community, a body politic, hence, 
a state, especially one constituted by a number of persons united by compact or 
tacit agreement under one form of government and system of laws. Detres v. Lions 
Bldg. Corp., C.A.Ill., 234 F.2d 596, 600.</P>
<P>See Government; Nation; State.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common-knowledge</STRONG> – Refers to what court may declare 
applicable to action without necessity of proof. It is knowledge that every 
intelligent person has, and includes matters of learning, experience, history, 
and facts of which judicial notice may be taken. Shelley v. Chilton’s Adm’r, 236 
Ky. 221, 32 S.W.2d 974, 977. See also Judicial notice.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common-law actions</STRONG> – Action governed by common law, rather 
than statutory, equitable, or civil law.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common-law assignments</STRONG>. Such forms of assignments for the 
benefit of creditors as were known to the common law, as distinguished from such 
as are of modern invention or authorized by statute.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common law cheat</STRONG> -The obtaining of money or property by 
means of a false token, symbol, or device; this being the definition of a cheat 
or “cheating” at common law.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common-law contempt</STRONG>. A name sometimes applied to proceedings 
for contempt which are criminal in their nature, as distinguished from those 
which are intended as purely civil remedies ordinarily arising out of the 
alleged violation of some order entered in the course of a chancery 
proceeding.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common law copyright</STRONG> — Authors’ proprietary interest in his 
creation before it has been published. An intangible, incorporeal right in an 
author of literary or artistic productions to reproduce and sell them 
exclusively and arises at the moment of their creation as distinguished from 
federal or statutory copyrights which exist for the most part only in published 
works. Common law copyright is perpetual while statutory copyright is for term 
of years. Equitable relief is available for violation of common law copyright. 
Edgar H. Wood Associates Inc. v. Skene, 347 Mass. 351, 197 N.E.2d 886. The 
distinction which formerly existed between common law copyrights and statutory 
copyrights was abolished by the 1976 Copyright Act revision; though ¤ 301 of the 
new Act specifically preserves common law copyrights accruing prior to January 
1, 1978. See also Copyright.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common law court</STRONG> – In England, those administering the 
common law.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common law crime</STRONG> –Common-law crime. One punishable by the 
force of the common law, as distinguished from crimes created by statute.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common law jurisdiction</STRONG> — Jurisdiction of a court to try and 
decide such cases as were cognizable by the courts of law under the English 
common law. The jurisdiction of those courts which exercise their judicial 
powers according to the course of the common law.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common law lawyer</STRONG> — A lawyer learned in the common law. This 
term is now generally obsolete.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common law lien</STRONG> — One known to or granted by the common law, 
as distinguished from statutory, equitable, and maritime liens; also one arising 
by implication of law, as distinguished from one created by the agreement of the 
parties. It is a right extended to a person to retain that which is in his 
possession belonging to another, until the demand or charge of the person in 
possession is paid or satisfied. Whiteside v. Rocky Mountain Fuel Co., 
C.C.A.Colo., 101 F.2d 765, 769.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common law marriage</STRONG> — One not solemnized in the ordinary way 
(i.e. non-ceremonial) but created by an agreement to marry, followed by 
cohabitation. A consummated agreement to marry, between persons legally capable 
of making marriage contract, per verba de praesenti, followed by cohabitation. 
Such marriage requires a positive mutual agreement, permanent and exclusive of 
all others, to enter into a marriage relationship, cohabitation sufficient to 
warrant a fulfillment of necessary relationship of man and wife, and an 
assumption of marital duties and obligations. Marshall v. State, Okl.Cr., 537 
P.2d 423, 429. Such marriages are invalid in many states; e.g Missouri (after 
1921), Indiana (after 1958), Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska (after 1939), 
Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York (after 1933), North 
Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota (after 1959), Virginia, Washington, W. Virginia, 
Wisconsin, Wyoming.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common law trust</STRONG> — A business trust which has certain 
characteristics in common with corporations and in which trustees hold the 
property and manage the business and the shareholders are the trust 
beneficiaries or cestui que trust; sometimes known as a Massachusetts trust. See 
Massachusetts trust.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common law wife</STRONG> — A woman who was party to a common-law 
marriage; or one who, having lived with a man in a relation of concubinage 
during his life, asserts a claim, after his death, to have been his wife 
according to the requirements of the common law.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common-law</STRONG> – As distinguished from statutory law created by 
the enactment of legislatures, the common law comprises the body of those 
principles and rules of action, relating to the government and security of per: 
sons and property, which derive their authority solely from usages and customs 
of immemorial antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees of the courts 
recognizing, affirming, and enforcing such usages and customs; and, in this 
sense, particularly the ancient unwritten law of England. In general, it is a 
body of law that develops and derives through judicial decisions, as 
distinguished from legislative enactments. The “common law” is all the statutory 
and case law background of England and the American colonies before the American 
revolution. People v. Rehman, 253 C.A.2d 119, 61 Cal. Rptr. 65, 85. It consists 
of those principles, usage and rules of action applicable to government and 
security of persons and property which do not rest for their authority upon any 
express and positive declaration of the will of the legislature. Bishop v. U. 
S., D.C.Tex., 334 F.Supp. 415, 418.</P>
<P>As distinguished from ecclesiastical law, it is the system of jurisprudence 
administered by the purely secular tribunals.</P>
<P>Calif. Civil Code, Section 22.2, provides that the “common law of England, so 
far as it is not repugnant to or ; inconsistent with the Constitution of the 
United States, or the Constitution or laws of this State, is the rule of 
decision in all the courts of this State.”</P>
<P>In a broad sense, “common law” may designate all that part of the positive 
law, juristic theory, and ancient ; custom of any state or nation which is of 
general and universal application, thus marking off special or local rules or 
customs.</P>
<P>For Federal common law, see that title. As a compound adjective “common-law” 
is understood as contrasted with or opposed to “statutory,” and sometimes also 
to “equitable” or to “criminal.” See examples below.</P>
<P><STRONG>Common law trademark</STRONG> – One appropriated under common-law 
rules, regardless of statutes. Stratton &amp; Terstegge Co. v. Stiglitz Furnace 
Co., 258 Ky. 678, 81 S.W.2d 1, 3.</P>
<P><STRONG>Court of Common Pleas</STRONG>. In English law, one of the four 
superior courts at Westminster, which existed up to the passing of the 
judicature acts. It was also styled the “Common Bench”. It was one of the courts 
derived from the breaking up of the aula regis, and had exclusive jurisdiction 
of all real actions and of communia placita, or common pleas, i.e., between 
subject and subject. It was presided over by a chief justice with four puisne 
judges (later five, by virtue of 31 &amp; 32, Vict., c.125, § 11, subsec. 8). 
Appeals lay anciently to the king’s bench, but afterwards to the exchequer 
chamber. See 3 Bl.Comm. 37, et seq. Its jurisdiction was altogether confined to 
civil matters, having no cognizance in criminal cases, and was concurrent with 
that of the queen’s bench and exchequer in personal actions and ejectment.</P>
<P>In 1873 the court became the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of 
Justice. In 1880 by Order in Council that division was merged into the Queen’s 
Bench Division.</P>
<P>In the United States, such courts exist in Pennsylvania wherein all civil and 
criminal actions are begun (except such as are brought before courts of inferior 
jurisdiction). Most such courts have been abolished, however, with their 
jurisdiction being transferred to district, circuit, or superior courts.</P>
<P><STRONG>complaint</STRONG> – The original or initial pleading by which an 
action is commenced under codes or Rules of Civil Procedure. E.g. Fed.R. Civil 
P. 3. The pleading which sets forth a claim for relief. Such complaint (whether 
it be the original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim) shall 
contain: (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court’s 
jurisdiction depends, unless the court already had jurisdiction and claim needs 
no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it, (2) a short and plain statement of 
the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for 
judgment for the relief to which he deems himself entitled. Relief in the 
alternative or of several different types may be demanded. Fed.R. Civil P. 8 
(a). The complaint, together with the summon, is required to be served on the 
defendant. Rule 4.&nbsp;<EM>See also Counterclaim; Cross-claim; Supplemental 
complaint; Third party complaint.</EM></P>
<P>In criminal law, a charge, preferred before a magistrate having jurisdiction 
that a person named (or an unknown person) has committed a specified offense, 
with an offer to prove the fact, to the end that a prosecution may be 
instituted. The complaint can be “taken out” by the victim, the police officer, 
the district attorney, or other interested party. Although the complaint charges 
an offense, an indictment or information may be the formal charging document. 
The complaint is a written statement of the essential facts constituting the 
offense charged. In the federal courts, it is to be made upon oath before a 
magistrate. Fed.R.Crim.P. 3. If it appears from the complaint that probable 
cause existy that the person named in the complaint committed the alleged crime, 
a warrant -&nbsp;<EM>(q.v.) </EM>-for his arrest will be issued. Fed.R.Crim.P. 
4.</P>
<P><STRONG>concurrent </STRONG>- Running together; having the same authority; 
acting in conjunction; agreeing in the same act or opinion; pursuit of same 
course; contributing to the same event; contemporaneous. Co-operating, 
accompanying, conjoined, associated, concomitant, joint and equal, existing 
together, and operating on the same subject. United in agreement. State ex rel. 
School Dist. No 8 v. Lensman, 108 Mont. 118, 88, 88 P.2d 63, 68.</P>
<P>As to concurrent Covenant; Insurance; Lease; Resolution; and Writ, see those 
titles.</P>
<P><STRONG>concurrent jurisdiction</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>- The jurisdiction 
of several different tribunals, each authorized to deal with the same 
subject-matter at the choice of the suitor. Authority shared by two or more 
legislative, judicial, or administrative officers or bodies to deal with the 
same subject matter. Jurisdiction exercised by different courts, at same time, 
over same subject matter, and within same terrirory, and wherein letigants may, 
in fir instance, resort to either court indifferently. State v. Stueve, 260 Iowa 
1023, 150 N.W.2d 597, 602. For example, some cases can be heard in a federal or 
state court. When a case can only be tried in federal court, or only in state 
court, jurisdiction&nbsp;is “exclusive.”</P>
<P><STRONG>Congress</STRONG> – Formal meeting of deegates or representatives. 
The Congress of the United States was created by Article I, Section 1, of the

charged with a variety of administrative and executive duties, but principally 
with the management of the financial affairs of the county, its police 
regulations, and its corporate business. Sometimes the local laws give them 
limited judicial powers. In some states they are called “supervisors”.</P>
<P><STRONG>County courts.</STRONG> The powers and jurisdiction of such courts 
are governed by state constitutions or statutes; some with strictly 
administrative, or strictly judicial functions, or a combination of both; some 
with only criminal jurisdiction, or only civil, or both; some have exclusive 
jurisdictions, others concurrent jurisdiction; such jurisdictional powers may, 
in addition, be either general or specific.</P>
<P>In England, such are the main civil courts. See the County Courts Act, 1984;

their names, as in other counties in the king’s; and all offenses were said to 
be done against their peace, and not, as in other places, contra pacem domini 
regis. But these privileges have in modern times nearly disappeared after the 
Judicature Act of 1925, ¤ 18 and the Courts Act of 1971.</P>

concerned and will profit.</P>
<P><STRONG>County road</STRONG> – One which lies wholly within one county, and

and corporate capacity and included within its governmental or corporate 
powers.</P>
<P><STRONG>Declaration of Independence</STRONG> – A formal declaration or 
announcement, promulgated July 4, 1776, by the Congress of the United States of 
America, in the name and behalf of the people of the colonies, asserting and 
proclaiming their independence of the British crown, vindicating their

free and independent nation.</P>
<P><STRONG>Delegation -</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>A sending away; a putting into 
commission; the assignment of a debt to another; the intrusting another with a 
general power to act for the good of those who depute him; a body of delegates. 
The transfer of authority by one person to another. The act of making or 
commissioning a delegate.</P>
<P>The Body of delegates from a State to a national nominating convention or 
from a county to a State or other party convention. The whole body of delegates 
or representatives sent to a convention or assembly from one district, place, or 
political unit are collectively spoken of as a “delegation”.</P>
<P>In civil law, a species of novation which consists in the change of one 
debtor for another, when he who is indebted substitutes a third person who 
obligates himself in his stead to the creditor, or to the person appointed by 
him so that the first debtor is acquitted and his obligation extinguished, and 
the creditor contents himself with the obligation of the second debtor. 
Delegation is essentially distinguished from any other species of novation, in 
this; that the former demands the consent of all three parties, but the latter 
that only of the two parties to the new debt. Delegation is novation effected by 
the intervention of another person whom the debtor, in order to be liberated 
from the creditor, gives to such creditor, or to him whom the creditor appoints; 
and such person so given becomes obliged to the creditor in the place of the 
original debtor.&nbsp;<EM>Perfect delegation</EM> exists when the debtor who 
makes the obligation is discharged by the creditor.&nbsp;<EM>Imperfect 
delegation</EM> exists when the creditor retains his rights against the original 
debtor.</P>
<P><STRONG>despot</STRONG> – This word, in its original and most simple 
acceptation signifies master and supreme lord; it is synonymous with monarch. A 
ruler with absolute power and authority, but taken in bad sense, as it is 
usually employed, in signifies a tyrant. In some nation, despot is the title 
given to the sovereign as king is given in others.</P>
<P><STRONG>Deportation -</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>Banishment to a foreign 
country, attended with confiscation of property and deprivation of civil rights. 
A punishment derived from the&nbsp;<EM>deportatio (q.v.)</EM><EM> </EM>of the 
Roman law.</P>
<P>The Transfer of an alien, excleded or expelled, from the United States to a 
foreign country. Petition for Milanovic, D.C.N.Y., 162 F.Supp. 890, 892. The 
removal or sending back of an alien to the country from which he came because 
his presence is deemed inconsistent with the public welfare, and without any 
punishment being imposed or contemplated. The list of grounds for deportation 
are set forth a 8 U.S.C.A. §1251, and the procedure are provided for in 
§§1252-1254.&nbsp;<EM>See also</EM><EM> </EM>Banishment. (<EM>Compare</EM> 
Extradition.)</P>
<P><STRONG>despotism</STRONG> – That abuse of government where 
the&nbsp;sovereign power; is not divided, but united and unlimited in the hands 
of a single man, whatever may be his official title. It is not, properly, a form 
of government.</P>
<P>“Despotism” is not exactly synonymous with “autocracy,” for the former 
involves the idea of tyranny or abuse of power, which is not necessarily implied 
by the latter. Every despotism is autocratic; but an autocracy is not 
necessarily despotic.</P>
<P><STRONG>De facto</STRONG> – In fact, in deed, actually. This phrase is used 
to characterize an officer, a government, a past action, or a state of affairs 
which must be accepted for all practical purposes, but is illegal or 
illegitimate. Thus, an office, position or status existing under a claim or 
color of right such as a de facto corporation. In this sense it is the contrary 
of de jure, which means rightful, legitimate, just, or constitutional. Thus, an 
officer, king, or government de facto is one who is in actual possession of the 
office or supreme power, but by usurpation, or without lawful title; while an 
officer, king, or governor de jure is one who has just claim and rightful title 
to the office or power, but has never had plenary possession of it, or is not in 
actual possession. MacLeod v. United States, 229 U.S. 416, 33 S.Ct. 955, 57 
L.Ed. 1260. A wife de facto is one whose marriage is voidable by decree, as 
distinguished from a wife de jure, or lawful wife. But the term is also 
frequently used independently of any distinction from de jure; thus a blockade 
de facto is a blockade which is actually maintained, as distinguished from a 
mere paper blockade. Compare De jure.</P>
<P>“De facto doctrine” will validate, on grounds of public policy and prevention 
of failure of public justice, the acts of officials who function under color of 
law. People v. Davis, 86 Mich.App. 514, 272 N.W.2d 707, 710.</P>
<P>As to de facto Corporation; Court; Domicile; Government, Merger, and Officer, 
see those titles.</P>
<P>In old English law it means respecting or concerning the principal act of a 
murder, which was technically denominated factum.</P>
<P><STRONG>de gratia</STRONG> — Of grace or favor, by favor.&nbsp;<EM>De 
speciali gratia</EM>, of special grace or favor.</P>
<P><STRONG>de jure</STRONG> — Descriptive of a condition in which there has been 
total compliance with all requirements of law. Of right; legitimate; lawful; by 
right and just title. In this sense it is the contrary of&nbsp;<EM>de 
facto</EM><EM> </EM><EM>(q.v)</EM>. It may also be contrasted with&nbsp;<EM>de 
gratia</EM><EM> </EM>in which it means “as a matter of right,” as&nbsp;<EM>de 
gratia</EM><EM> </EM>,m in which case it means “as a matter of right,” 
as&nbsp;<EM>de gratia</EM><EM> </EM>means ” by grace or favor.” Again it may be 
contrasted with&nbsp;<EM>de aequitate;</EM><EM> </EM>here meaning “by law,” as 
the latter means “by equity.”</P>
<P><STRONG>District of Columbia</STRONG> – A&nbsp;territory&nbsp;situated on the 
Potomac river, and being the seat of government of the United States. It was 
originally ten miles square, and was composed of portions of Maryland and 
Virginia ceded by those states to the United States; but in 1846 the tract 
coming from Virginia was retroceded. Legally it is neither a state nor 
a&nbsp;territory, but is made subject, by the Constitution, to the 
exclusive&nbsp;jurisdiction&nbsp;of&nbsp;Congress.</P>
<P><STRONG>et al</STRONG> – An abbreviation for&nbsp;<EM>-et alii,</EM>- “and 
other.” The singular is “et alus” -<EM>(q.v.)</EM><EM> </EM>-. It may also mean 
“and another” in the singular.</P>
<P>The abbreviation et al. (sometimes in the plural written&nbsp;<EM>-et 
als.)</EM> – is often affixed to the name of the person first mentioned, where 
there are several plaintiffs, grantors, person addressed, etc.</P>
<P>Where the words “et al.” are used in a judgment against defendants, the 
quoted words include all defendants. Williams v. Williams, 25 Tenn.App.290, 156 
S.W.2d 363, 369.</P>
<P><STRONG>Et ux -</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>An abbreviation for&nbsp;<EM>et 
usor, —-</EM>” and wife.” Where a grantor’s wife joins him in the conveyance, it 
is sometimes expressed (in abstracts, etc.) to be by “A.B.&nbsp;<EM>et 
ux.”</EM></P>
<P><STRONG>Exception</STRONG> – Act of excepting or excluding from a number 
designated or from a description, that which is excepted or separated from 
others in a general rule or description; a person, thing, or case specified as 
distinct or not included; an act of excepting, omitting from mention or leaving 
out of consideration. Express exclusion of something from operation of contract 
or deed. An “exception” operates to take something out of thing l granted which 
would otherwise pass or be included. Christman v. Emineth, N.D., 212 N.W.2d 543, 
552. Such excludes from the operation of conveyance the interest specified and 
it remains in grantor unaffected by conveyance. Elrod v. Heirs, Devisees, etc., 
156 Neb. 269, 55 N.W.2d 673, 675, 676.</P>
<P>Objection to order or ruling of trial court. A formal objection to the action 
of the court, during the trial of a cause, in refusing a request or overruling 
an objection implying that the party excepting does not acquiesce in the 
decision of the court, but will seek to procure its reversed and that he means 
to save the benefit of his request or objection in some future proceeding. Under 
rules practice in the federal and most stab court the need for claiming an 
exception to evidence or to a ruling to preserve appellate right has been 
eliminated in favor of an objection. Fed.R. Civil P. 46.<BR>See also Challenge; 
Dilatory exceptions General exception; Objection; Peremptory exceptions; 
Reservation; Specie exception.<BR><STRONG>Bill of exceptions</STRONG>. See 
Bill.</P>
<P>Deed An exception withdraws from operation of deed part of thing granted 
which would otherwise pass to grantee.</P>
<P>Insurance policy. An exclusion of one or more risks. Kirkby v. Federal Life 
Ins. Co., C.C.A.Mich., 35 F.2d 126, 128. The object of an exception is to 
exclude that which otherwise would be included, to take special cases out of a 
general class, or to guard against misinterpretation.</P>
<P>“Reservation” and “proviso” compared. A “reservation” creates some new right 
in grantor while an “exception” withholds from grant title to some part of 
property which would otherwise pass. Clark v. Pauley, 291 Ky. 637, 165 S.W.2d 
161, 162. A reservation does not affect the description of the property 
conveyed, but retains to the grantor some right upon the property, as an 
easement, whereas an exception operates upon the description and withdraws from 
the description the excepted property. Moore v. Davis, 273 Ky. 838, 117 S.W.2d 
1033, 1035. A “reservation” is always of something taken back out of that which 
is clearly granted, while an “exception” is of some part of the estate not 
granted at all. Lewis v. Standard Oil Co. of California, C.C.A.Cal., 88 F.2d 
512, 514. An exception exempts:, absolutely, from the operation of an engagement 
or an enactment; a proviso, properly speaking, defeats their operation, 
conditionally. An exception takes out of an engagement or enactment something 
which would otherwise be part of the subject-matter of it; a proviso avoids them 
by way of defeasance or excuse. Reservation reserves to grantor some new 
interest out of thing granted, while exception excludes from operation of grant 
some existing part of estate. Petty v. Griffith, Mo., 165 S.W.2d 412, 414; U. S. 
v. 1,010.8 Acres, More or Less, Situate in Sussex County, Del., D.C.Del., 56 
F.Supp. 120, 128.<BR>It has also been held however that a “proviso” and an 
“exception” are substantially the same thing, and that the terms are frequently 
used interchangeably for synonymous terms. Victory Oil Co. v. Hancock Oil Co., 
270 P.2d 604, 611.</P>
<P>Compare also Variance.</P>
<P>Statutory laws. An exception in a statute is a clause designed to reserve or 
exempt some individuals from the general class of persons or things to which the 
language of the act in general attaches. The office of an “exception” in a 
statute is to except something from the operative effect of a statute or to 
qualify or restrain the generality of the substantive enactment to which it is 
attached, and it is not necessarily limited to the section of the statute 
immediately following or preceding. Gattliff Coal Co. v. Cox, C.C.A.Ky., 142 
F.2d 876, 882. Two statutes relating to same subject must be read together, and 
provisions of one having special application to particular subject will be 
deemed an “exception” to other statute general in its terms. Eagleton v. Murphy, 
348 Mo. 949, 156 S.W. 2d 683, 685. See Grandfather 
clause.<BR><STRONG>Exclusionary hearing</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>- Pre-trial 
hearing at which alleged illegally obtained evidence is reviewed by trial judge 
to determine whether such is admissible at trial. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(bX3). See 
also Exclusionary Rule.</P>
<P><STRONG>Exclusionary rule&nbsp;- </STRONG>This rule commands that where 
evidence has been obtained in violation Of the search and seizure protections 
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, the illegally obtained evidence cannot be 
used at the trial of the defendant. Under this rule evidence which is obtained 
by an unreasonable search and seizure is excluded from admissibility under the 
Fourth Amendment, and this rule has been held to be applicable to the States. 
Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081.</P>
<P>“Good faith exception” to exclusionary rule provides that evidence is not to 
be suppressed under such rule where that evidence was discovered by officers 
acting in good faith and in reasonable, though mistaken, belief that they were 
authorized to take those actions. United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 
3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677. This exception recognizes that officers who have acted 
with objective good faith have right to rely upon issuing magistrate’s 
determination that substantial basis existed for finding probable cause. State 
v. Murphy, Mo.App., 693 S.W.2d 255, 266.</P>

including, admitting, or pertaining to any others. Sole. Shutting out; debarring 
from interference or participation; vested in one person alone. Apart from all 
others, without the admission of others to participation. People on Complaint of 
Samboy v. Sherman, 158 N.Y. S.2d 835, 837.</P>
<P><STRONG>Exclusive jurisdiction</STRONG>. That power which a court or other 
tribunal exercises over an action or over a person to the exclusion of all other 
courts. That forum in which an action must be commenced because no other forum 
has the jurisdiction to hear and determine the action. For example, by statute, 
actions brought under the Securities Exchange Act must be brought in federal 
district court.</P>
<P>Exclusive and concurrent jurisdiction. The federal courts have original and 
exclusive jurisdiction over certain actions (e.g. controversies between two or 
more states) and concurrent jurisdiction with that of state courts in others 
(e.g. actions’ between citizens of different states).</P>
<P><STRONG>Executive order</STRONG> – An order or regulation issued by the 
President or some administrative authority under his direction for the purpose

orders must be published in the&nbsp;Federal Register.</P>
<P><STRONG>Ex parte -</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>On one side only; by or for one 
party; done for, in behalf of, or on the application of, one party only.</P>
<P>A judicial proceeding, order, injunction, etc., is said to be&nbsp;<EM>ex

one party only, and without notice to or contestation by, any person adversely 
interested.</P>
<P>“<EM>Ex parte,”</EM><EM> </EM>in the heading of a reported case, signifies 
that the name following is that of the party upon whose application the case is 
heard.</P>
<P><STRONG>Extradition -</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>The surrender by one state or 
country to another of an individual accused or convicted of an offense outside 
its own territory and within the territorial jurisdiction of the other, which,

<P><STRONG>Extraterritoriality -</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>The extraterritorial 
operation of laws; that is, their operation upon person, rights, or jural 
relations, existing beyond the limits of the enacting state or nation, but still 
amenable to its laws. A term used, especially formerly, to express, in lieu of 
the word exterritoriality the exemption from the obligation of the laws of a 
state granted to foreign diplomatic agents, warships, etc. The term is used to 
indicate jurisdiction exercise by a nation in other countries by treaty, or by 
its own ministers or consuls in foreign lands. Crime is said to be 
extraterritorial when committed in a state or country other than that of the 
forum in which the party is tried.</P>
<P><STRONG>Ex rel.</STRONG> See Ex relatione.</P>
<P><STRONG>Ex relatione</STRONG> -&nbsp; Upon relation or information.</P>
<P>Legal proceedings which are instituted by the attorney general (or other 
proper person) in the name and behalf of the state, but on the information and 
at the instigation of an individual who has a private interest in the matter, 
are said to be taken “on the relation” (ex relatione) of such person, who is 
called the “relator.” Such a cause is usually entitled thus: “State ex rel. Doe 
v. Roe.”</P>
<P>In the books of reports, when a case is said to be reported ex relatione, it 
is meant that the reporter derives his account of it, not from personal 
knowledge, but from the relation or narrative of some person who was present at 
the argument.</P>

jurisdiction thereof is a citizen of the United States and of the State wherein 
he resides. Fourteenth Amend., U.S. Const.&nbsp;<EM>See also Citizenship; 
Naturalization</EM></P>
<P><STRONG>federal common law</STRONG> – A body of decisional law developed by 
the federal courts. The application of this body of common law is limited by 
the&nbsp;<EM>Erie</EM> doctrine and by the Rules of Decision Act, which provides 
that except for cases governed by the Constitution, the treaties of the United 
States, or acts of Congress, federal courts are to apply state law. Areas in 
which federal common law have been developed include federal “proprietary” 
interests, admiralty and foreign relations. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 
64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188. See also Erie v. Tompkins; Rules of Decision 
Act; Swift v. Tyson Case.</P>
<P><STRONG>federal crimes</STRONG> – Those acts which have been made criminal by 
federal law. There are no federal common law crimes though many federal statutes 
have incorporated the elements of common law crimes. Most federal crimes are 
codified in Title 18 of the United States Code; though other Code Titles also 
include specific crimes. Such crimes (e.g. RICO offenses, tax evasion, 
interstate kidnapping) are prosecuted in federal courts.</P>
<P><STRONG>Federal Government</STRONG> – The system of government administered 
in a nation formed by the union or confederation of several independent 
states.</P>
<P>In strict usage, there is a distinction between a confederation and a federal 
government The former term denotes a league or permanent alliance between 
several states, each of which is fully sovereign and independent, and each of 
which retains its full dignity, organization, and sovereignty, though yielding 
to the central authority a controlling power for a few limited purposes, such as 
external and diplomatic relations. In this case, the component states are the 
units, with respect to the confederation, and the central government acts upon 
them, not upon the individual citizens. In a federal government, on the other 
hand, the allied states form a union (e.,¢. United States),-not, indeed. to such 
an extent as to destroy their separate organization or deprive them of quasi 
sovereignty with respect to the administration of their purely local concerns, 
but so that the central power is erected into a true national government, 
possessing sovereignty both external and internal, -while the administration of 
national affairs is directed, and its effects felt, not by the separate states 
deliberating as units, but by the people of all, in their collective capacity, 
as citizens of the nation. The distinction is expressed, by the German writers, 
by the use of the two words&nbsp;<EM>“Staatenbund”</EM> 
and&nbsp;<EM>“Bundesstaat;”</EM> the former denoting a league or confederation 
of states, and the latter a federal government, or state formed by means of a 
league or confederation. See also Federal.</P>
<P><STRONG>Federal Register</STRONG> – The Federal Register, published daily, is 
the medium for making available to the public Federal agency regulations and 
other legal documents of the executive branch. These documents cover a wade 
range of government activities. An important function of the Federal Register is 
that it includes proposed changes (rules, regulations, standards, etc.) of 
governmental agencies. Each proposed change published carries an invitation for 
any citizen or group to participate in the consideration of the proposed 
regulation through the submission of written data, views, or arguments, and 
sometimes by oral presentations. Such regulations and rules as finally approved 
appear thereafter in the Code of Federal Regulations.</P>

<P>An exemption from some burden or attendance, with r which certain persons are 
indulged, from a supposition of law that the stations they fill, or the offices 
they are engaged in, are such as require all their time and care, and that, 
therefore, without this indulgence, it would be impracticable to execute such

<P><EM>Deliberative process privilege</EM> -. This governmental privilege 
permits government to withhold documents that reflect advisory opinions, 
recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which 
government decisions and policies are formulated, and was developed to promote 
frank and independent discussion among those responsible for making governmental 
decisions and to protect against premature disclosure of proposed agency 
policies or decisions. F.T.C. v. Warner Communications Inc., C.A.Cal., 742 F.2d 
1156, 1161. Discovery. When interrogatories, depositions or other forms of 
discovery seek information which is otherwise privileged, the party from whom it

<P><EM>Libel and slander</EM> -. An exemption from liability for the speaking or 
publishing of defamatory words concerning another, based on the fact that the 
statement was made in the performance of a political, judicial, social, or 
personal duty. Privilege is either absolute or conditional. The former protects 
the speaker or publisher without reference to his motives or the truth or 
falsity of the statement. This may be claimed in respect, for instance, to 
statements made in legislative debates, in reports of military officers to their 
superiors in the line of their duty, and statements made by judges, witnesses, 
and jurors in trials in court. Conditional privilege (called also “qualified 
privilege”) will protect the speaker or publisher unless actual malice and 
knowledge of the falsity of the statement is shown. This may be claimed where 
the communication related to a matter of public interest, or where it was 
necessary to protect one’s private interest and was made to a person having an 
interest in the same matter. Saroyan v. Burkett, 57 Cal.2d 706, 21 Cal.Rptr. 
557, 558, 371 P.2d 293.</P>

<P><EM>Maritime law.</EM> – An allowance to the master of a ship of the same 
general nature with primage, being compensation, or rather a gratuity, customary 
in certain trades, and which the law assumes to be a fair and equitable 
allowance, because the contract on both sides is made under the knowledge of 
such usage by the parties.</P>
<P><EM>Parliamentary law.</EM> – The right of a particular question, motion, or 
statement to take precedence over all other business before the house and to be 
considered immediately, notwithstanding any consequent interference with or 
setting aside the rules of procedure adopted by the house. The matter may be one 
of “personal privilege,” where it concerns one member of the house in his 
capacity as a legislator, or of the “privilege of the house,” where it concerns 
the rights, immunities, or dignity of the entire body, or of “constitutional 
privilege,” where it relates to some action to be taken or some order of 
proceeding expressly enjoined by the constitution .</P>
<P><EM>Privilege from arrest.</EM> – A privilege extended to certain classes of 
persons, either by the rules of international law, the policy of the law, or the 
necessities of justice or of the administration of government, whereby they are 
exempted from arrest on civil process, and, in some cases, on criminal charges, 
either permanently, as in the case of a foreign minister and his suite, or 
temporarily, as in the case of members of the legislature, parties and witnesses 
engaged in a particular suit, etc. Art. I, ¤ 6,; U.S.Const. See also 
Immunity.</P>
<P><EM>Privilege tax.</EM> – A tax on the privilege of carrying on a l business 
or occupation for which a license or franchise is required. Gulf &amp; Ship 
Island R. Co. v. Hewes, 183 U.S. 66, 22 S.Ct. 26, 46 L.Ed. 86.</P>
<P><EM>Torts.</EM> – Privilege is the general term applied to certain rules of 
law by which particular circumstances justify conduct which otherwise would be 
tortious, and thereby defeat the tort liability (or defense) which, in the 
absence of such circumstances, ordinarily would follow from that conduct. In 
other words, even if all of the facts necessary to a prima facie case of tort 
liability can be proved, there are additional facts present sufficient to 
establish some privilege, and therefore defendant has committed no tort. 
Privileges thus differ from other defenses, such as contributory negligence, 
which operate to bar plaintiffs recovery but do not negate the tortious nature 
of defendant’s conduct. Conversely, plaintiffs privilege may defeat a defense 
which defendant otherwise might have had. The term and concept of privilege 
apply primarily to the intentional torts, but also appear in other areas, such 
as defamation.</P>
<P><EM>See Libel and slander, above.</EM></P>
<P>A privilege may be based upon: (a) the consent of the other affected by the 
actor’s conduct, or (b) the fact that its exercise is necessary for the 
protection of some interest of the actor or of the public which is of such 
importance as to justify the harm caused or threatened by its exercise, or (c) 
the fact that the actor is performing a function for the proper performance of 
which freedom of action is essential. Restatement, Second, Torts, ¤ 10.</P>
<P>Privileges may be divided into two general categories: (1) consent, and (2) 
privileges created by law irrespective of consent. In general, the latter arise 
where there is some important and overriding social value in sanctioning 
defendant’s conduct, despite the fact that it causes plaintiff harm.</P>
<P>Privilege is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded by defendant.

<P><EM>Writ of privilege.</EM> – A common law process to enforce or maintain a 
privilege; particularly to secure the release of a person arrested in a civil 
suit contrary to his privilege.</P>
<P><STRONG>Privileges and Immunities Clause</STRONG> -Privileges and immunities 
clause. There are two Privileges and Immunities Clauses in the federal 
Constitution and Amendments, the first being found in Art. IV, and the second in 
the 14th Amendment, ¤ 1, second sentence, clause 1. The provision in Art. IV 
states that “The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and 
Immunities of Citizens in the several States,” while the 14th Amendment provides 
that “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges 
or immunities of citizens of the United States.</P>
<P>The purpose of these Clauses is to place the citizens of each State upon the 
same footing with citizens of other states, so far as the advantages resulting 
from citizenship in those states is concerned, to insure that a citizen of State 
A who ventures into State B be accorded the same privileges that the citizens of 
State B enjoy. Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U.S. 385, 68 S.Ct. 1156, 92 L.Ed. 1460. 
Pursuing a common calling, plying a trade, and doing business in another state 
are examples of “privileges” protected by the privileges and immunities clause 
of the Federal Constitution. Powell v. Daily, Wyo., 712 P.2d 356, 359. See also 
Full faith and credit clause.</P>
<P><STRONG>Proclamation</STRONG>. The act of publicly proclaiming or publishing; 
a formal declaration; an avowal; a public announcement giving notice of a 
governmental act that has been done or is to be done. The act of causing some 
governmental matters to be published or made generally known. A written or 
printed document in which are contained such matters, issued by proper 
authority, usually by a high governmental executive (President, Governor, 
Mayor).</P>
<P>The declaration made by the bailiff, by authority of the court, that 
something is about to be done.</P>
<P>In equity practice, proclamation made by a sheriff upon a writ of attachment, 
summoning a defendant who has failed to appear personally to appear and answer 
the plaintiff’s bill.</P>
<P><STRONG>Quiet Title action</STRONG> – A proceeding to establish the 
plaintiff’s title to land by bringing into court an adverse claimant and there 
compelling him either to establish his claim or be forever after estopped from 
asserting it.&nbsp;<EM>See also Action to quiet title; Cloud on title.</EM></P>
<P><STRONG>Redaction -</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>In broad sense, term refers to 
any revision or editing, but in a legal sense, it has come to indicate 
alteration of a confession to excise any reference by one joint defendant to any 
codefendant. Com. v. Guess, 266 Ps, Super, 359, 404 A.2d 1330, 1338</P>
<P><STRONG>Republic</STRONG> – A<SPAN 
style="text-decoration: underline;"></SPAN>commonwealth; that form 
of&nbsp;government&nbsp;in which the administration of affairs is open to all 
the<SPAN style="text-decoration: underline;"></SPAN>citizens. In another sense, 
it signifies the&nbsp;state, independently of its form of government.</P>
<P><STRONG>res judicata</STRONG> —- A matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted 
upon or decided; a think or matter settled by judgment. Rule that a final 
judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction on the merits is 
conclusive as to the rights of the parties and their privies, and, as to them, 
constitutes an absolute bar to a subsequent action involving the same claim, 
demand or cause of action. Matchett v. Rose, 36 Ill.A;.3d 638, 344 N.E.2d 770, 
779. And to be applicable, requires identity in thing sued for as well as 
identity of cause of action, of persons and parties to action, and of quality in 
persons for or against whom claim is made. The sum and substance of the whole 
rule is that a matter once judicially decided. Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 
101 S.Ct. 411, 415, 66 L.Ed.2d 308. See also Collateral estoppel doctrine; Final 
decision rule; Issue preclusion.</P>
<P><STRONG>RICO laws</STRONG>. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
laws. Federal and state laws designed to investigate, control, and prosecute 
organized crime. 18 U.S.C.A. § 1961 et seq. Both criminal prosecution and civil 
actions may be brought under RICO statutes.</P>
<P>Federal RICO laws prohibit a person from engaging in activities which affect 
interstate or foreign commerce, including: (1) using income received from a 
pattern of racketeering to acquire an interest in an enterprise; (2) acquiring 
or maintaining an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; 
(3) conducting or participating in the affairs of an enterprise through a 
pattern of racketeering; and, (4) conspiring to commit any of the above 
offenses. To establish a prima facie RICO claim, a civil plaintiff or prosecutor 
must allege the existence of seven elements: “(1) that the defendant (2) through 
the commission of two or more acts (3) constituting a ‘pattern’ (4) of 
‘racketeering activity’ (5) directly or indirectly invests in, or maintains an 
interest in, or participates in (6) an ‘enterprise’ (7) the activities of which 
affect interstate or foreign commerce.” 18 U.S.C.A. § 1962. Moss v. Morgan 
Stanley, Inc., C.A. N.Y., 719 F.2d 5, 17.</P>
<P>See also Pattern of racketeering activity.</P>
<P><STRONG>rider</STRONG> – A schedule or small piece of paper reflecting an 
amendment, addition or endorsement annexed to some part of a contract, document, 
insurance policy, or record. Any kind of a schedule or writing annexed to a 
document which cannot well be incorporated in the body of such document. Such 
are deemed to be incorporated into the terms of the document. Thus, in passing 
bills through a legislature, when a new clause or law is added after the bill 
has passed through committee, such new law or clause is termed a “rider.” 
Another common example of a rider is an attachment to an insurance policy that 
modifies the conditions of the policy by expanding or restricting its benefits 
or excluding certain conditions from coverage. With the use of the rider the 
entire document does not have to be rewritten or redrafted again.</P>
<P><STRONG>right</STRONG> – As a noun, and taken in an&nbsp;<EM>abstract</EM> 
sense, means justice, ethical correctness, or consonance with the rules of law 
or the principles of morals. In this signification it answers to one meaning of 
the Latin “<EM>jus,</EM> ” and serves to indicate law in the abstract, 
considered as the foundation of all rights, or the complex of underlying moral 
principles which impart the character Of justice to all positive law, or give it 
an ethical content. As a noun, and taken in a&nbsp;<EM>concrete</EM> sense, a 
power, privilege. faculty, or demand, inherent in one person and incident upon 
another. Rights are defined generally as “powers of free action.” And the primal 
rights pertaining to men are enjoyed by human beings purely as such, being 
grounded in personality, and existing antecedently to their recognition by 
positive law. But leaving the abstract moral sphere, and giving to the term a 
juristic content, a “right” is well defined as “a capacity residing in one man 
of controlling, with the assent and assistance of the state, the actions of 
others.”</P>
<P>As an adjective, the term “right” means just, morally correct, consonant with 
ethical principles or rules of positive law. It is the opposite of wrong, 
unjust, illegal.</P>
<P>A power, privilege, or immunity guaranteed under a constitution, statutes or 
decisional laws, or claimed as a result of long usage.&nbsp;<EM>See Bill of 
rights; Civil liberties; Civil Rights Acts; Natural rights.</EM></P>
<P>In a narrower signification, an interest or title in an object of property; a 
just and legal claim to hold, use, or enjoy it, or to convey or donate it, as he 
may please.</P>
<P>A legally enforceable claim of one person against another, that the other 
shall do a given act, or shall not do a given act. Restatement of the Law of 
Property, ¤ 1.</P>
<P>That which one person ought to have or receive from another, it being 
withheld from him, or not in his possession. In this sense “right” has the force 
of “claim,” and is properly expressed by the Latin “<EM>jus.</EM>“</P>
<P><EM>See also Conditional right; Correlative rights; Droit; Jus; Justice; 
Natural rights; Power; Recht; Vested rights.</EM></P>
<P><STRONG>General Classification</STRONG></P>
<P>Rights may be described as<EM> perfect</EM> or<EM> imperfect</EM>, according 
as their action or scope is clear, settled, and determinate, or is vague and 
unfixed. Rights are also either<EM> in personam </EM>or<EM> in rem.</EM> A 
right&nbsp;<EM>in personam</EM> is one which imposes an obligation on a definite 
person. A right<EM> in rem</EM> is one which imposes an obligation on persons 
generally; i.e., either on all the world or on all the world except certain 
determinate persons. Thus, if I am entitled to exclude all persons from a given 
piece of land, I have a right&nbsp;<EM>in rem</EM> in respect of that land; and, 
if there are one or more persons, A., B., and C., whom I am not entitled to 
exclude from it, my right is still a right<EM>in rem.</EM></P>
<P>Rights may also be described as either<EM>primary </EM>or<EM> 
secondary.Primary </EM>rights are those which can be created without reference 
to rights already existing.&nbsp;<EM>Secondary </EM>rights can only arise for 
the purpose of protecting or enforcing primary rights. They are either 
preventive (protective) or remedial (reparative).&nbsp;<EM>Preventive</EM> 
or&nbsp;<EM>protective</EM> secondary rights exist in order to prevent the 
infringement or loss of primary rights. They are judicial when they require the 
assistance of a court of law for their enforcement, and extrajudicial when they 
are capable of being exercised by the party himself.&nbsp;<EM>Remedial</EM> 
or<EM> reparative secondary </EM>rights are also either judicial or 
extrajudicial. They may further be divided into (l) rights of restitution or 
restoration, which entitle the person injured to be replaced in his original 
position; (2) rights Of enforcement, which en title the person injured to the 
performance of an act by the person bound; and (3) rights of satisfaction or 
compensation.</P>
<P>With respect to the ownership of external objects of property, rights may be 
classed as&nbsp;<EM>absolute</EM> and&nbsp;<EM>qualified. </EM>An absolute right 
gives to the person in whom it inheres the uncontrolled dominion over the object 
at all times and for all purposes. A qualified right gives the possessor a right 
to the object for certain purposes or under certain circumstances only. Such is 
the right of a bailee to recover the article bailed when it has been unlawfully 
taken from him by a stranger.</P>
<P>Rights are also either<EM> legal </EM>or&nbsp;<EM>equitable</EM>. The former 
is the case where the person seeking to enforce the right for his own benefit 
has the legal title and a remedy at law. The latter are such as are enforceable 
only in equity; as, at the suit of<EM> cestui que trust. </EM>Procedurally, 
under Rules of Civil Procedure, both legal and equitable rights are enforced in 
the same court under a single cause of action.</P>
<P><STRONG>Constitutional Rights</STRONG></P>
<P>There is also a classification of rights, with respect to the constitution of 
civil society. Thus, according to Blackstone, “the rights of persons, considered 
in their natural capacities, are of two sorts,-&nbsp;<EM>absolute</EM> 
and&nbsp;<EM>relative</EM>; absolute, which are such as appertain and belong to 
particular men, merely as individuals or single persons; relative, which are 
incident to them as members of society, and standing in various relations to 
each other.” 1 Bl.Comm. 123.</P>
<P>Rights are also classified in constitutional law as natural, civil, and 
political, to which there is sometimes added the class of “personal rights.”</P>
<P><EM>Natural rights</EM> are those which grow out of the nature of man and 
depend upon personality, as distinguished from such as are created by law and 
depend upon civilized society; or they are those which are plainly assured by 
natural law; or those which, by fair deduction from the present physical, moral, 
social, and religious characteristics of man, he must be invested with, and 
which he ought to have realized for him in a jural society, in order to fulfill 
the ends to which his nature calls him. Such are the rights of life, liberty, 
privacy, and good reputation.</P>
<P><EM>Civil rights</EM> are such as belong to every citizen of the state or 
country, or, in a wider sense, to all its inhabitants, and are not connected 
with the organization or administration of government. They include the rights 
of property, marriage, equal protection of the laws, freedom of contract, trial 
by jury, etc. Or, as otherwise defined, civil rights are rights appertaining to 
a person by virtue of his citizenship in a state or community. Such term may 
also refer, in its very general sense, to rights capable of being enforced or 
redressed in a civil action. Also, a term applied to certain rights secured to 
citizens of the United States by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments to the 
Constitution, and by various acts of Congress (e.g. Civil Rights Acts) made in 
pursuance thereof.&nbsp;<EM>See Bill of Rights; Civil liberties; Civil Rights 
Acts.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Political </EM>rights consist in the power to participate, directly or 
indirectly, in the establishment or administration of government, such as the 
right of citizenship, that of suffrage, the right to hold public office, and the 
right of petition. Personal rights is a term of rather vague import, but 
generally it may be said to mean the right of personal security, comprising 
those of life, limb, body, health, reputation, and the right of personal 
liberty.</P>

<P><STRONG>Sovereign</STRONG> – The supreme, absolute, and uncontrollable power 
by which any independent state is governed; supreme political authority; the 
supreme will; paramount control of the constitution and frame of government and 
its administration; the self-sufficient source of political power, from which 
all specific political powers are derived; the international independence of a 
state, combined with the right and power of regulating its internal affairs 
without foreign dictation; also a political society, or state, which is 
sovereign and independent.</P>
<P>The power to do everything in a state without accountability,-to make laws, 
to execute and to apply them, to impose and collect taxes and levy 
contributions, to make war or peace, to form treaties of alliance or of commerce 
with foreign nations, and the like.</P>
<P>Sovereignty in government is that public authority which directs or orders 
what is to be done by each member associated in relation to the end of the 
association. It is the supreme power by which any citizen is j governed and is 
the person or body of persons in the | state to whom there is politically no 
superior. The | necessary existence of the state and that right and power which 
necessarily follow is “sovereignty.” By “sovereignty” in its largest sense is 
meant supreme, absolute, uncontrollable power, the absolute right to govern. The 
word which by itself comes nearest to being the definition of “sovereignty” is 
will or volition as applied to political affairs. City of Bisbee v. Cochise 
County, 52 Ariz. 1, 78 P.2d 982, 986.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sovereign immunity</STRONG> A judicial doctrine which precludes 
bringing suit against the government without its consent. Founded on the ancient 
principle that “the King can do no wrong,” it bars holding the government or its 
political subdivisions liable for the torts of its officers or agents unless 
such immunity is expressly waived by statute or by necessary inference from 
legislative enactment. Maryland Port Admin. v. I.T.O. Corp. of Baltimore, 40 
Md.App. 697, 395 A.2d 145, 149. The federal government has generally waived its 
non-tort action immunity in the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.A. ¤ 1346(a)(2), 1491, and 
its tort immunity in the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.A. ¤ 1346(b), 2674. 
Most states have also waived immunity in various degrees at both the state and 
local government levels.</P>

<P><EM>Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act</EM> – Subject to existing international 
agreements to which the U.S. is a party, and to certain statutorily prescribed 
exceptions, a foreign nation is immune from the jurisdiction of federal and 
state courts. 28 U.S.C.A. ¤ 1601-1611.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sovereign people</STRONG> The political body, consisting of the 
entire number of citizens and qualified electors, who, in their collective 
capacity, possess the powers of sovereignty and exercise them through their 
chosen representatives. See Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 404, 15 L.Ed. 691.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sovereign power</STRONG> or sovereign prerogative. That power in a 
state to which none other is superior or equal, and which includes all the 
specific powers necessary to accomplish the legitimate ends and purposes of 
government. AEtna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Bramwell, D.C. Or., 12 F.2d 307, 
309.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sovereign right</STRONG>. A right which the state alone, or some of 
its governmental agencies, can possess, and which it possesses in the character 
of a sovereign, for the common benefit, and to enable it to carry out its proper 
functions; distinguished from such “proprietary” rights as a state, like any 
private person, may have in property or demands which it owns.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sovereign states</STRONG> – States whose subjects or citizens are in 
the habit of obedience to them, and which are not themselves subject to any 
other (or paramount) state in any respect. The state is said to be 
semi-sovereign only, and not sovereign, when in any respect or respects it is 
liable to be controlled by a paramount government. In the intercourse of 
nations, certain states have a position of entire independence of others, and 
can perform all those acts which it is possible for any state to perform in this 
particular sphere. These same states have also entire power of self-government; 
that is, of independence upon all other states as far as their own territory l 
and citizens not living abroad are concerned. No foreign power or law can have 
control except by convention. This power of independent action in external and 
internal relations constitutes complete sovereignty.</P>
<P><STRONG>state’s attorney</STRONG> -An officer who represents the State in 
securing indictments and in prosecuting criminal cases. Also called District or 
County Attorney or Prosecuting Attorney. Commonly he is elected in a county 
election and his authority is county wide.</P>
<P><STRONG>State bank</STRONG> – Those banks chartered by n state in contrast to 
federally chartered banks. Banks under the supervision and jurisdiction of state 
agencies. See also Bank.</P>
<P><STRONG>State courts</STRONG> – Those courts which constitute the state 
judicial system in contrast to federal courts. City and county courts may or may 
not be part of the state system of courts, depending upon the jurisdiction.</P>
<P><STRONG>State Department</STRONG> – That department in the executive branch 
of the federal government, headed by the Secretary of State, which is 
principally responsible for foreign affairs and foreign trade. The Department 
determines and analyzes the facts relating to our overseas interests, makes 
recommendations on policy and future action, and takes the necessary steps to 
carry out established policy. In so doing, the Department engages in continuous 
consultations with other states; negotiates treaties and agreements with foreign 
nations; speaks for the United States in the United Nations and in numerous 
major international organizations in which the United States participates; and 
represents the United States at numerous major international organizations in 
which the United States participates; and represents the United States at 
numerous international conferences annually.</P>
<P><STRONG>State Law</STRONG> -State last Refers to laws of a state or 
ordinances of city or town, all as distinguished from Federal law which is the 
supreme law of the land under Art. VI of the U.S. Constitution. However, in 
matters which are not necessarily governed by Federal law, the Federal courts 
will look to state law and be governed by it. See Erie v. Tompkins. Compare 
Federal Acts.</P>
<P><STRONG>state officer</STRONG> – One who holds elective or appointive 
position in state government, e.g. state attorney general.</P>
<P><STRONG>state police power</STRONG> – Every state has power to enact laws for 
the protection of its citizens’ health, welfare, morals and safety and such 
power is derived from the 10th Amendment, U.S. Const. This power is upheld if 
exercised in a manner consistent with its ends and if the means used are 
reasonably calculated to protect one of these legitimate ends. See also Police 
power.</P>
<P><STRONG>state seal</STRONG> – State seal. The official die or signet having a 
raised emblem and used by state officials on documents of importance. Every 
state has its own such seal.</P>
<P><STRONG>state secret</STRONG> – A governmental secret relating to national 
defense or international relations of United States and, once established, 
government has a privilege to refuse to disclose the secret in civil litigation 
and to prevent any litigant from disclosing the secret. Sigler v. LeVan, 
D.C.Md., 485 F.Supp. 185, 193.</P>
<P><STRONG>state secrets privilege</STRONG> – This is a long-standing 
evidentiary privilege that permits government to resist discovery of evidence if 
disclosure reasonably could be seen as threat to military or diplomatic interest 
of nation; when properly invoked, privilege is absolute, and no showing of need 
can overcome it. Halkin v. Helms, C.A.D.C., 690 F.2d 977, 990.</P>
<P><STRONG>state’s sovereignty</STRONG> – The right of a state to 
self-government. The role of supreme authority or rule exercised by every state 
within the Union. See also Sovereign states.</P>
<P><STRONG>Territory</STRONG>. A part of a country separated from the rest, and 
subject to a particular jurisdiction. Geographical area under the jurisdiction 
of another country or sovereign power.</P>
<P>A portion of the United States, not within the limits of any state, which has 
not yet been admitted as a state of the Union, but is organized, with a separate 
legislature, and with executive and judicial officers appointed by the 
president. See Trust territory.</P>
<P>An assigned geographical area of responsibility; e.g. salesman’s 
territory.</P>
<P><STRONG>tyranny</STRONG> -Arbitrary or&nbsp;despotic;&nbsp;government;; the 
severe and autocratic exercise of&nbsp;sovereign power; either vested 
constitutionally in one ruler, or usurped by him by breaking down the division 
and distribution of governmental powers.</P>
<P><STRONG>Unconstitutional</STRONG> – That which is contrary to or in conflict 
with a constitution. The opposite of “constitutional”. Norton v. Shelby county, 
118 U.S. 425, 6 S.Ct.1121, 30 L.Ed. 178</P>
<P>This word is used in two different senses. One, which may be called the 
English sense, is that the legislation conflicts with some recognized general 
principle. This is no more than to say that it is unwise, or is based upon a 
wrong or unsound principle, or conflicts with a generally accepted policy. The 
other, which may be called to American sense, is that the legislation conflicts 
with some provision of our written Constitution, which it is beyond the power of 
a legislative body to change. U.S. v. American Brewing Co., D.C.Pa., 1 F.2d 101, 
102.</P>
<P><EM>See also&nbsp;Unlawful</EM></P>
<P><STRONG>Unlawful</STRONG> – That which is contrary to, prohibited, or 
unauthorized by law. That which is no lawful. The acting contrary to, or in 
defiance of the law; disobeying or disregarding the law. Term is equivalent to 
“without excuse or justification.” State v. Noble, 90 N.M. 360, 563 P.2d 1153, 
1157. While necessarily not implying the element of criminality, it is broad 
enough to include it.&nbsp;<EM>See Crime; Criminal.</EM></P>
<P>Term as applied to agreements and the like, denotes they are ineffectual in 
law, for they involve acts which, though not positively forbidden, are 
disapproved by law and are therefore not recognized as ground of legal rights 
because they are against public policy. Conine v. Leikam, Okl., 570 P. 2d 1156, 
1159.</P>
<P><STRONG>Unlawful detainer -</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>The unjustifiable 
retention of the possession of real property by one whose original entry was 
lawful and of right, but whose right to the possession has terminated and who 
refuses to quit, as in the case of a tenant holding over after the termination 
of the lease and in spite of a demand for possession by the landlord. Brandley 
v. Lewis, 97 Utah 217, 92 P.2d 338, 339. Actions of “unlawful detainer” concern 
only right of possession of realty, and differ from ejectment in that no 
ultimate question of title or estate can be determined. McCracken v. Wright, 159 
Kan. 615, 157 P.2d 814, 817.&nbsp;<EM>See also</EM> Detainer; Ejectment; 
Eviction; Forcible detainer, Forcible entry and detainer; Process (<EM>Summary 
process</EM>).</P>
<P><STRONG>United States</STRONG> – This term has several meanings. It may be 
merely the name of a sovereign occupying the position analogous to that of other 
sovereigns in family of nations, it may designate territory over which 
sovereignty of United States extends, or it may be collective name of the states 
which are united by and under the Constitution. Hooven &amp; Allison Co. v. 
Evatt, U.S.Ohio, 324 U.S. 652, 65 S.Ct. 870, 880, 89 L.Ed.1252</P>
<P><STRONG>Venue -</STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG>Formerly 
spelled<EM></EM><EM>visne</EM> In common law pleading and practice, a 
neighborhood; the neighborhood, place, or county in which an injury is declared 
to have been done, or fact declared to have happened. 3 Bl. Comm. 294.</P>
<P>The particular county, or geographical area, in which a court with 
jurisdiction may hear and determine a case. Venue deals with locality of suit, 
that is, with question of which court, or courts, of those that possess adequate 
personal and subject matter jurisdiction may hear the specific suit in question. 
Japan Gas Lighter Ass’n v. Ronson Corp., D.C.N.J., 257 F.Supp. 219, 224. It 
relates only to place where or territory within which either party may require 
case to be tried. Leege v. Strand, 384 P.2d 665, 668. It has relation to 
convenience of litigants and may be waived or laid by consent of parties. Iselin 
v. La Coste, C.C.A.La., 147 F.2d 791, 795.</P>
<P>In the federal courts, the term refers to the district in which the suit is 
brought. Venue may be determined by where the action arose or where the parties 
reside or conduct their business. The venue statute for civil actions in federal 
district courts is 28 U.S.C.A. § 1391.</P>
<P>In federal cases the prosecutor’s discretion regarding the location of the 
prosecution is limited by Article III, § 2, U.S.Const., which requires trial in 
the state where the offense “shall have been committed,” and the Sixth 
Amendment, which guarantees an impartial jury “of the state and district wherein 
the crime shall have been committed.” See also Federal criminal cases, 
below.</P>
<P>Venue does not refer to jurisdiction at all. Arganbright v. Good, 46 
Cal.App.2d Supp. 877, 116 P.2d 186. “Jurisdiction” of the court means the 
inherent power to decide a case, whereas “venue” designates the particular 
county or city in which a court with jurisdiction may hear and determine the 
case. Village of Oakdale v. Ferrante, 44 Ohio App.2d 318, 338 N.E.2d 767, 769. 
As such, while a defect in venue may be waived by the parties, lack of 
jurisdiction may not.<BR>See also Change of venue; Forum conveniens; Forum non 
conveniens.</P>
<P>Federal criminal cases. Except as otherwise permitted by statute or by the 
rules, the prosecution shall be had in a district in which the offense was 
committed. The court shall fix the place of trial within the district with due 
regard to the convenience of the defendant and the witnesses. Fed.R.Crim.P. 18 
et seq.</P></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV><!-- /#main -->         </DIV><!-- /#content -->
