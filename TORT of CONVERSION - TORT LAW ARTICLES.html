</script></div></div></div></div><br /></div><div>The tort of conversion diverges from that of trespass to chattels in that a conversion involves the taking of dominion over the item in question, to the extent of completely depriving the owner of its use. As explained in our last article, a mistake is not a successful defense against this violation of rights.</div><div><br /></div><div>This law is clarified in the 1914 U.S. case of Poggi v. Scott. In essence, plaintiff Poggi rented a locked storage room in the basement of a building in order to house barrels of wine. Some while later, the original owner sold the building to the defendant, Scott. During the ensuing litigation, this owner claimed to have notified the buyer of Poggi’s sub-leasing agreement. Still, he could produce no documentation of this information. Unaware of the transaction, when Poggi visited the basement to check on his barrels, he discovered they had comprised part of the sale between the original owner and Scott. </div><div><div></div><br /></div><div>The defendant, Scott, claimed that, when two men offered to take these “broken” barrels in exchange for $15 and their cleaning of the basement, he had inspected them and ascertained that each of them was empty. In terms of conversion, the court was called upon to determine whether an innocent mistake freed a defendant from liability. After a series of appeals brought by both parties, the court decided against mistake as a viable defense to taking dominion over the property of another.</div><div><br /></div><div>The court’s decision was based on the view that in order to prevail in a cause of action for conversion, a plaintiff need not demonstrate a deliberate act on the defendant’s part to dispossess him of his property. The impact of an act, rather than the intention behind it, constituted liability. Thus, the plaintiff succeeded in his cause of action for conversion in that the defendant assumed absolute dominion over the barrels and the wine contained within them. While in trespass to chattels cases, the owner must accept the return of the item if adequately repaired, conversion renders the defendant liable for full restitution, either of the item itself or its monetary equivalent, defined as compensatory damages. </div><div><br /></div><div>As conversion is an intentional tort, punitive damages may be added. These damages tend to be granted when a court establishes or intuits some level of malice on the part of the defendant. Thus, if the court could have unearthed evidence that some rancor lay beneath Scott’s use of Poggi’s wine, Poggi might have been awarded a larger amount. (The subject of the various levels of damages and the reasons will be addressed in a later article dedicated to that subject.) </div><div><br /></div><div>In an over-all sense, the consequences of the tort of conversion can be summarized by a concise sign in a shop, placed above a shelf containing blown-glass items: “These ornaments should be treated as gold. This means if you break one, consider it sold”. This warning is valid in that conversion constitutes the taking of dominion over a chattel belonging to another. Thus, in a basic rhyme, breaking means taking. </div><div><br /></div><div>The following case is often deployed in American law school textbooks in order to illustrate a unique way in which the tort of conversion can be applied. In this 1968 case, a Mr. Rouse, (hereinafter plaintiff) went to the dealership of Russell-Vaughn Ford Inc. (hereinafter defendant) Ford), to discuss his purchase of a more upscale vehicle than he and his wife currently owned. Despite negotiations, no definite agreement was reached. Thus, plaintiff returned to his home, then returned to defendant’s place of business with his wife and children.</div><div><br /></div><div>Despite further discussion, their dealings remained inconclusive. The following evening, plaintiff returned with a friend in order to engage in further discussion. During this visit, one of Ford’s salesmen asked plaintiff for the keys to his car, while plaintiff drove the car he hoped to buy around the dealership’s lot. Afterwards, when no financial compromise had been reached, plaintiff asked for the return of his keys. At this point, the two salesmen with whom he had dealt claimed to have no knowledge as to the whereabouts of these keys.</div><div><br /></div><div>According to over-all testimony, several employees were apprised of the fact that plaintiff wished to regain his keys from the recalcitrant salesmen. In his testimony, plaintiff claimed that a number of mechanics and sales representatives were sitting on nearby cars, sneering at his increasing anxiety. Frustrated by this behavior, plaintiff phoned the local police. The police officer who responded to the call later testified that, shortly after he arrived at the show room, one of Ford’s sales representatives threw the keys at plaintiff, called him a cry-baby, and said they had just wanted to enjoy watching him cry a bit longer.</div><div><br /></div><div>Their defense to the charge of conversion was that, if any conversion had occurred, it was only of the keys to the car, rather than that of the car itself. The court dismissed this defense, supporting its finding partly based upon precedents from prior decisions that acquisition of property does not necessarily mean an actual taking of a chattel from a defendant. Conversion may consist in exercising dominion over an object in exclusion or defiance of the right of a plaintiff.</div><div> </div><div>In a surprising admission elicited during the trial, the defendant conceded it was customary in the industry to “lose keys”, in order to prolong negotiations with reluctant, reticent customers. A further argument by defendant was that plaintiff had the option of phoning his wife at home in order to ask her to bring the set of keys in her keeping. Again, the court gave no credence to this contention.</div><div><br /></div><div>Despite the established doctrine of avoidable consequences, the law does not require a plaintiff to exhaust every feasible avenue in order to regain access to property rightfully in his possession, especially when kept out of reach by a defendant.  Indeed, defendant’s argument that if there had been any conversion, it had been only of the keys, was deemed specious by the court, in that this withholding meant lack of access to the use of the vehicle. In support of its decision in plaintiff’s favor, the court referred to a case in which refusal to provide tickets to a warehouse deprived a legitimate purchaser of cotton from access to his taking possession of it. </div><div>---</div><div>With time, medical science has evolved to the point where human organs, tissues and cells can prove crucial both in the preservation of an individual human life or as tools for research in order to inhibit, or ideally cure, debilitating and/or terminal illnesses. Still, the question remains unresolved as to the rights of a plaintiff to determine the use of any body part for any purpose beyond diagnosis of his own condition or illness.</div><div> </div><div>By way of example, admitted serial killer Ted Bundy, prior to his execution, was asked if his brain matter might be excised, in a post-mortem, in order to facilitate studies of the minds of such compulsive murderers. Even as his death was approaching, Bundy stated that, though he did not wish to die, he knew that, if released, he would kill further victims then unknown to him. A study of his brain mechanism would have proved of particular use, in that this handsome, charismatic, well-spoken law student could have made such a fine use of his life that even his sentencing judge said he wished he could have encountered Bundy as a lawyer in his a courtroom, rather than a man upon whom he felt no choice but to confer a sentence of death. Still, while society as a whole was allowed to execute Bundy, it could not study his brain matter without his permission.</div><div><br /></div><div>The need for consent of unauthorized use of cells was litigated in the 1990 case of Moore v. The Regents of the University of California. This case, which ultimately reached the state supreme court, was brought by John Moore, who had been treated for leukemia by the UCLA Medical Center. Moore’s case was based on the fact that, without having obtained his permission, researchers at this center were deploying cells from various parts of his body, including those from bone marrow and sperm, in order to assist in studies of recombinant DNA. Moore’s cells helped to provide information pivotal to this research.</div><div><br /></div><div>The center’s request for a patent, likely to result in a substantial lucrative gain was accepted, based, to a large degree, upon information gleaned from cells extracted from Moore’s body. Having ascertained that the center had obtained their patent as a result of the use of his cells, Moore based his suit, in pertinent part, on the tort of conversion. This center, he claimed, had taken dominion over cells obtained from his tissues and bones without his permission having been requested.</div><div> </div><div>Ultimately, the court determined the center’s use of Moore’s cells fell below the threshold required for a finding of the tort of conversion. Implicitly, to find in Moore’s favor would require the judicial system to trace the roots of the consent of the use of every human cell utilized in research. In addition, in order to set forth a viable cause of action for conversion, every plaintiff in any such case would need to prove an actual interference with his ownership or right of possession.</div><div> </div><div>While a patient retains the ultimate right to decide what should be done with his cells, parties with productive intentions, such as medical researchers who have no basis for believing the use of excised cell samples is contrary to a patient’s wishes, should not be held liable for such a use. Otherwise, the ultimate use of such cells may be viewed as a ticket to a litigation lottery. In reading this judicial opinion, we sense that the use of cells for research likely to benefit society as a whole, while causing no detriment to a patient, is both endorsed and encouraged. </div><div>------</div><div>Identity Theft.</div><div>As with trespass to chattels, current case law indicates a trend in causes of action for conversion in the taking of dominion over intangible property owned by another. Given our current laws, it is hard to envision that, during Chaucer’s time, the quoting of the writing of a previous author in one’s own work, attributed accordingly, was viewed as the apex of praise. Since that time, laws regarding plagiarism and its various offshoots such as pirating, have grown so rigid as to instill fear of the slightest overstepping of evermore menacing boundaries. Still, identity theft seems to be amongst the most prevalent sources of tortious conversion.</div><div><br /></div><div>For the most part, this type of conversion is deployed for purposes of transgressing immigration laws, evading creditors, or some other nefarious purpose. Still, as will be shown in the case below, the object of such a theft may have no seeds in any type of malevolence. </div><div><br /></div><div>This proved true when Wendy Brown, a thirty-three-year-old mother, stole the identity of her fifteen-year-old daughter, thereby converting this identity to her own use. Wendy Brown, having a prior history of fraud, was able to persuade a local high school to accept her as a student. As such, she succeeded in her efforts to join the high school’s cheer-leading squad. While some staff viewed Ms. Brown’s appearance as a bit too mature, her dress, combined with her timid and tearful demeanor succeeded in convincing the high school administrators to accept her.</div><div><br /></div><div>Ms. Brown presented herself as a student who, having left high school too early, had agonized since that time at her failing to graduate and earn her diploma. After that, No major queries were launched until Wendy Brown ceased attending classes after her first day at the school. This, combined with the bouncing of her check required to join the cheer-leading team, led to more serious probing.</div><div><br /></div><div>Having been called in and then brought to account, Ms. Brown, in humiliation, admitted having posed as her daughter, a student at a separate high school, in the custody of Wendy Brown’s mother. This custody arrangement Wendy Brown confessed was due to her inability to provide the nurturing needed by an adolescent girl in order to progress towards maturity. When prosecuted, Ms. Brown’s sole defense lay in insanity. According to this defense, anguish suffered during her younger years overpowered her rational ability as an adult to develop cogent decisions. </div><div><br /></div><div>If this identity theft was based on an effort to quaff a sip from Ponce de Leon’s elusive fountain of youth, its results proved toxic. Even if Ms. Brown’s defense succeeds in convincing the court of its validity, the final judicial decision will almost inevitably involve some degree of hospitalization and ongoing psychological care. Perhaps such care is somewhat long overdue, given Wendy Brown’s history.</div><div> </div><div>While we can view this case of misconduct with a degree of compassion, it also alerts us to the ease with which an identity can be converted by far more intricate methods. Even the most seemingly innocuous email or telephone “market survey” or pen/e-pal site can be a harvester of information. The statement that knowledge is power has taken on graver overtones with electronic expansion.</div><div><br /></div><div>A further avenue of conversion lies in the relationship between that of bailor and bailee. Over-all, a bailment consists of an agreement between two parties wherein one party consents to assume responsibility for the care of one or more items belonging to another, often for a designated period of time or an agreed-upon purpose. Thus, an airport garage might agree to rent a car parking space to a passenger on an airline for the duration of his trip... Similarly, a computer repair shop may retain a customer’s computer on its premises, in order to conduct essential repairs.</div><div><br /></div><div>In early common law, there were a number of types of bailments with liability depending upon the type of care required and relationship between the parties. This policy has shifted to our current view that all bailors are legally bound to treat any item, for as long as they have accepted its care, with the same degree of diligence they would exercise regarding their own possessions.</div><div><br /></div><div>Naturally, as with every rule there are built-in exceptions, primarily based upon commonsense. A home-owner in the habit of leaving his dwelling unlocked when away for short periods of time will be required to show more vigilance if this home contains a workshop in which he undertakes to provide repairs to the goods of others.</div><div><br /></div><div>Still, in the event of a flood, earthquake or other natural disaster, a bailor will not be liable to his bailee for any harm occurring to any entrusted property.  A separate situation arises in cases of involuntary bailment. By way of example, if Gary leaves his guitar on Patty’s patio, with the following note attached: “I’m taking a moonlight flit-please take care of this guitar for me”, is under no obligation to do so. If the guitar is stolen, whether outside or inside her flat, she is in no way liable. In fact, she has the right to use this guitar herself, lend/rent/sell it to a third party, or dispose of it at a dumpster. </div><div><br /></div><div>In a more typical situation, unless the agreement specifies a bailor’s freedom to use the item according to his discretion, a bailee has every right to expect the chattel to be returned in the exact condition in which the bailer received it. Even a voluntary improvement made by the bailor, at no cost to the bailee, can render the bailor liable for violation of the agreement. Initially, this sounds illogical. Still, let’s assume an elderly aunt leaves an antique clock in the care of a nephew during a week-long hospitalization. For decades, this clock has ceased to function in terms of time-keeping. Instead, it has stood as a treasured ornament at the center of the aunt’s mantelpiece. </div><div><br /></div><div>The nephew, in hopes of providing a cheering surprise, has the inner workings of this clock restored. While realizing this change was meant as an act of affection, the aunt may feel aggrieved by this alteration. Her primary joy in this clock may have been the calm induced by its stillness; constant Indication of the passing of time may cause her severe agitation.</div><div><br /></div><div>Additionally, in purely financial terms, this “improvement” may diminish the value of the antique, due to the modernization of its mechanism. Although the nephew did not intentionally trespass upon or take dominion over the ownership of this clock, he did intentionally alter the function of an item placed in his care, without having first obtained the consent of its owner.</div><div> </div><div>A great deal has been written about the rights of finders of lost property. Are finders keepers in the legal sense? There is no question that if the finder is aware of the owner of the found item, he is obliged to return it to him. Failure to do so will be deemed a conversion. Where such an object is found in a public setting such as a restaurant, airport or shop, there is generally a desk at which such things can be left and reported. One might also bring the object to a police station. Often, if an identifiable owner does not come forward after a specified time, the finder becomes entitled to its possession.</div><div><br /></div><div>The most fortunate finders are rare in that the item discovered falls within the treasure trove theory. In such instances, an object of value is found to which no-one has a justifiable claim. This might occur where the proverbial message in a bottle reads: “I have hidden a large number of gems in XYZ. These I bequeath to whoever finds this message floating up from the sea.” The stuff of legends and fairytale, yes. Still, the existence of the treasure trove doctrine indicates that they can and do happen.</div><div><br /></div><div>A more likely scenario would consist of the finding of a collection of letters or diaries found in an attic by the purchaser of a home. Issues as to the time and diligence required in attempting to locate the rightful owner or his descendants could be the source of controversy. </div><div>End</div><div><br /></div><div><div>Bibliography listed on Home page</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div><div class="sites-embed-align-center-wrapping-off"><div class="sites-embed-border-off sites-embed" style="width:300px;"><div class="sites-embed-content sites-embed-type-adsense"><script type="text/javascript">
