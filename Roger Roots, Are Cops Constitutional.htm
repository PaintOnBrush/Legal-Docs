<P>Police work is often lionized by jurists and scholars who claim to		employ 
"textualist" and "originalist" methods of constitutional interpretation.		Yet 
professional police were unknown to the United States in 1789, and first

		private citizens, along with a few constables and sheriffs who could be called
		upon when necessary. This article marshals extensive historical and legal
		evidence to show that modern policing is in many ways inconsistent with the
		original intent of America's founding documents. The author argues that the
		growth of modern policing has substantially empowered the state in a way the
		Framers would regard as abhorrent to their foremost principles.</P>

<P align="CENTER">PART I</P>
<P align="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</P>
<P>Uniformed police officers are the most visible element of America's		criminal 
justice system. Their numbers have grown exponentially over the past		century 
and now stand at hundreds of thousands nationwide.<SUP>1</SUP> Police		expenses 
account for the largest segment of most municipal budgets and		generally dwarf 
expenses for fire, trash, and sewer services.<SUP>2</SUP>		Neither casual 
observers nor learned authorities regard the sight of hundreds		of armed, 
uniformed state agents on America's roads and street corners as		anything 
peculiar — let alone invalid or unconstitutional.</P>
<P>Yet the dissident English colonists who framed the United States
		Constitution would have seen this modern 'police state' as alien to their
		foremost principles. Under the criminal justice model known to the Framers,
		professional police officers were unknown.<SUP>3</SUP> The general public had
		broad law enforcement powers and only the executive functions of the law 
(e.g.,		the execution of writs, warrants and orders) were performed by 
constables or		sheriffs (who might call upon members of the community for
		assistance).<SUP>4</SUP> Initiation and investigation of criminal cases was 
the		nearly exclusive province of private persons.</P>
<P>At the time of the Constitution's ratification, the office of sheriff		was an 
appointed position, and constables were either elected or drafted from		the 
community to serve without pay.<SUP>5</SUP> Most of their duties involved		civil 
executions rather than criminal law enforcement. The courts of that		period were 
venues for private litigation — whether civil or criminal		 — and the state was 
rarely a party. Professional police as we know them		today originated in 
American cities during the second quarter of the nineteenth		century, when 
municipal governments drafted citizens to maintain		order.<SUP>6</SUP> The role 
of these "nightly watch" officers gradually grew to		encompass the catching of 
criminals, which had formerly been the responsibility		of individual 
citizens.<SUP>7</SUP></P>
<P>While this historical disconnect is widely known by criminal justice
		historians, rarely has it been juxtaposed against the Constitution and the
		Constitution's imposed scheme of criminal justice.<SUP>8</SUP> "Originalist"
		scholars of the Constitution have tended to be supportive, rather than 
critical		of modern policing.<SUP>9</SUP> This article will show, however, that 
modern		policing violates the Framers' most firmly held conceptions of criminal
		justice.</P>
<P>The modern police-driven model of law enforcement helps sustain a		playing 
field that is fundamentally uneven for different players upon it.		Modern police 
act as an army of assistants for state prosecutors and gather		evidence solely 
with an eye toward the state's interests. Police seal off crime		scenes from the 
purview of defense investigators, act as witnesses of		convenience for the state 
in courts of law, and instigate a substantial amount		of criminal activity under 
the guise of crime fighting. Additionally, police		enforce social class norms 
and act as tools of empowerment for favored interest		groups to the disadvantage 
of others.<SUP>10</SUP> Police are also a political		force that constantly 
lobbies for increased state power and decreased		constitutional liberty for 
American citizens.</P>
<P align="CENTER">THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT</P>
<P>The Constitution contains no explicit provisions for criminal law
		enforcement.<SUP>11</SUP> Nor did the constitutions of any of the several
		states contain such provisions at the time of the Founding.<SUP>12</SUP> Early
		constitutions enunciated the intention that law enforcement was a universal
		duty that each person owed to the community, rather than a power of the
		government.<SUP>13</SUP> Founding-era constitutions addressed law enforcement
		from the standpoint of individual liberties and placed explicit barriers upon
		the state.<SUP>14</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">PRIVATE PROSECUTORS</P>
<P>For decades before and after the Revolution, the adjudication of		criminals 
in America was governed primarily by the rule of private prosecution:		(1) 
victims of serious crimes approached a community grand jury, (2) the grand		jury 
investigated the matter and issued an indictment only if it concluded that		a 
crime should be charged, and (3) the victim himself or his representative
		(generally an attorney but sometimes a state attorney general) prosecuted the
		defendant before a petit jury of twelve men.<SUP>15</SUP> Criminal actions 
were		only a step away from civil actions — the only material difference being
		that criminal claims ostensibly involved an interest of the public at large as
		well as the victim.<SUP>16</SUP> Private prosecutors acted under authority of
		the people and in the name of the state — but for their own
		vindication.<SUP>17</SUP> The very term "prosecutor" meant criminal plaintiff
		and implied a private person.<SUP>18</SUP> A <I>government</I> prosecutor was
		referred to as an attorney general and was a rare phenomenon in criminal cases
		at the time of the nation's founding.<SUP>19</SUP> When a private individual
		prosecuted an action in the name of the state, the attorney general was
		required to allow the prosecutor to use his name — even if the attorney
		general himself did not approve of the action.<SUP>20</SUP></P>
<P>Private prosecution meant that criminal cases were for the most part		limited 
by the need of crime victims for vindication.<SUP>21</SUP> Crime		victims held 
the keys to a potential defendant's fate and often negotiated the		settlement of 
criminal cases.<SUP>22 </SUP>After a case was initiated in the		name of the 
people, however, private prosecutors were prohibited from		withdrawing the 
action pursuant to private agreement with the		defendant.<SUP>23</SUP> Court 
intervention was occasionally required to compel		injured crime victims to 
appear against offenders in court and "not to make		bargains to allow 
[defendants] to escape conviction, if they ... repair the
		injury."<SUP>24</SUP></P>
<P>Grand jurors often acted as the detectives of the period. They conducted
		their investigations in the manner of neighborhood sleuths, dispersing
		throughout the community to question people about their knowledge of
		crimes.<SUP>25</SUP> They could act on the testimony of one of their own
		members, or even on information known to grand jurors before the grand jury
		convened.<SUP>26</SUP> They might never have contact with a government
		prosecutor or any other officer of the executive branch.<SUP>27</SUP></P>
<P>Colonial grand juries also occasionally served an important law		enforcement 
need by account of their sheer numbers. In the early 1700s, grand		jurors were 
sometimes called upon to make arrests in cases where suspects were		armed and in 
large numbers.<SUP>28</SUP> A lone sheriff or deputy had reason to		fear even 
approaching a large group "without danger of his life or having his		bones 
broken."<SUP>29</SUP> When a sheriff was unable to execute a warrant or		perform 
an execution, he could call upon a <I>posse</I> of citizens to assist
		him.<SUP>30</SUP> The availability of the <I>posse comitatus</I> meant that a
		sheriffs resources were essentially unlimited.<SUP>31</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">LAW ENFORCEMENT AS A UNIVERSAL DUTY</P>
<P>Law enforcement in the Founders' time was a <I>duty</I> of every
		citizen.<SUP>32</SUP> Citizens were expected to be armed and equipped to chase
		suspects on foot, on horse, or with wagon whenever summoned. And when called
		upon to enforce the laws of the state, citizens were to respond "not faintly
		and with lagging steps, but honestly and bravely and with whatever implements
		and facilities [were] convenient and at hand."<SUP>33</SUP> Any person could
		act in the capacity of a constable without being one,<SUP>34</SUP> and when
		summoned by a law enforcement officer, a private person became a temporary
		member of the police department.<SUP>35</SUP> The law also presumed that any
		person acting in his public capacity as an officer was rightfully
		appointed.<SUP>36</SUP></P>
<P>Laws in virtually every state still require citizens to aid in capturing
		escaped prisoners, arresting criminal suspects, and executing legal process.
		The duty of citizens to enforce the law was and is a constitutional one. Many
		early state constitutions purported to bind citizens into a universal
		obligation to perform law enforcement functions, yet evinced no mention of any
		state power to carry out those same functions.<SUP>37</SUP> But the law
		enforcement duties of the citizenry are now a long-forgotten remnant of the
		Framers' era. By the 1960s, only twelve percent of the public claimed to have
		ever personally acted to combat crime.<SUP>38</SUP></P>
<P>The Founders could not have envisioned 'police' officers as we know them
		today. The term "police" had a slightly different meaning at the time of the
		Founding.<SUP>39</SUP> It was generally used as a verb and meant to watch over
		or monitor the public health and safety.<SUP>40</SUP> In Louisiana, "police
		juries" were local governing bodies similar to county boards in other
		states.<SUP>41</SUP> Only in the mid-nineteenth century did the term 'police'
		begin to take on the persona of a uniformed state law enforcer.<SUP>42</SUP>
		The term first crept into Supreme Court jurisprudence even
		later.<SUP>43</SUP></P>
<P>Prior to the 1850s, rugged individualism and self-reliance were the
		touchstones of American law, culture, and industry. Although a puritan 
cultural		and legal ethic pervaded their society, Americans had great toleration 
for		victimless misconduct.<SUP>44</SUP> Traffic disputes were resolved through
		personal negotiation and common law tort principles, rather than driver
		licenses and armed police patrol.<SUP>45 </SUP>Agents of the state did not
		exist for the protection of the individual citizen. The night watch of early
		American cities concerned itself primarily with the danger of fire, and
		watchmen were often afraid to enter some of the most notorious neighborhoods 
of		cities like Boston.<SUP>46</SUP></P>
<P>At the time of Tocqueville's observations (in the 1830s), "the means
		available to the authorities for the discovery of crimes and arrest of
		criminals [were] few,"<SUP>47</SUP> yet Tocqueville doubted "whether in any
		other country crime so seldom escapes punishment."<SUP>48</SUP> Citizens
		handled most crimes informally, forming committees to catch criminals and hand
		them over to the courts.<SUP>49</SUP> Private mobs in early America dealt with
		larger threats to public safety and welfare, such as houses of ill
		fame.<SUP>50</SUP> Nothing struck a European traveler in America, wrote
		Tocqueville, more than the absence of government in the
		streets.<SUP>51</SUP></P>
<P><I>Formal</I> criminal justice institutions dealt only with the most		severe 
crimes. Misdemeanor offenses had to be dealt with by the private citizen		on the 
private citizen's own terms. "The farther back the [crime rate] figures		go," 
according to historian Roger Lane, "the higher is the relative proportion		of 
serious crimes."<SUP>52</SUP> In other words, before the advent of		professional 
policing, fewer crimes — and only the most serious crimes		 — were brought to 
the attention of the courts.</P>
<P>After the 1850s, cities in the northeastern United States gradually		acquired 
more uniformed patrol officers. The criminal justice model of the		Framers' era 
grew less recognizable. The growth of police units reflected a		"change in 
attitude" more than worsening crime rates.<SUP>53</SUP> Americans		became less 
tolerant of violence in their streets and demanded higher standards		of 
conduct.<SUP>54</SUP> Offenses which had formerly earned two-year sentences
		were now punished by three to four years or more in a state
		penitentiary.<SUP>55</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">POLICE AS SOCIAL WORKERS</P>
<P>Few of the duties of Founding-era sheriffs involved criminal law
		enforcement. Instead, <I>civil</I> executions, attachments and confinements
		dominated their work.<SUP>56</SUP> When professional police units first 
arrived		on the American scene, they functioned primarily as protectors of 
public		safety, health and welfare. This role followed the "bobbie" model 
developed in		England in the 1830s by the father of professional policing, Sir 
Robert		Peel.<SUP>57</SUP></P>
<P>Early police agencies provided a vast array of municipal services,		including 
keeping traffic thoroughfares clear. Boston police made 30,681		arrests during 
one fiscal year in the 1880s, but in the same year reported		1,472 accidents, 
secured 2,461 buildings found open, reported thousands of		dangerous and 
defective streets, sidewalks, chimneys, drains, sewers and		hydrants, tended to 
169 corpses, assisted 148 intoxicated persons, located		1,572 lost children, 
reported 228 missing (but only 151 found) persons, rescued		seven persons from 
drowning, assisted nearly 2,000 sick, injured, and insane		persons, found 311 
stray horse teams, and removed more <I>than fifty		thousand</I> street 
obstructions.<SUP>58</SUP></P>
<P>Police were a "kind of catchall or residual welfare		agency,"<SUP>59</SUP> a 
lawful extension of actual state 'police		powers.'<SUP>60</SUP> In the Old West, 
police were a sanitation and repair		workforce more than a corps of 
crime-fighting gun-slingers. Sheriff Wyatt Earp		of OK Corral fame, for example, 
repaired boardwalks as part of his		duties.<SUP>61</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">THE WAR ON CRIME</P>
<P>Toward the end of the nineteenth century, police forces took on a brave		new 
role: crime-fighting. The goal of maintaining public order became secondary		to 
chasing lawbreakers. The police cultivated a perception that they were		public 
heroes who "fought crime" in the general, rather than individual sense.		 </P>
<P>The 1920s saw the rise of the profession's second father — or		perhaps its 
wicked stepfather — J. Edgar Hoover.<SUP>62</SUP> Hoover's		Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) came to epitomize the police profession		in its sleuth and 
intelligence-gathering role. FBI agents infiltrated mobster		organizations, 
intercepted communications between suspected criminals, and		gathered 
intelligence for both law enforcement and political purposes.</P>
<P>This new view of police as soldiers locked in combat against crime		caught on 
quickly.<SUP>63</SUP> The FBI led local police to develop integrated
		repositories of fingerprint, criminal, and fraudulent check records. The FBI
		also took over the gathering of crime statistics (theretofore gathered by a
		private association),<SUP>64</SUP> and went to war against "Public Enemy 
Number		One" and others on their "Ten Most Wanted" list.<SUP>65</SUP> Popular 
culture		began to see police as a "thin blue line," that "serves and protects" 
civilized		society from chaos and lawlessness.<SUP>66</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">THE ABSENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL CRIME-FIGHTING POWER</P>
<P>But the constitutions of the Founding Era gave no hint of any thin blue
		line. Nothing in their texts enunciated any governmental power to "fight 
crime"		at all. "Crime-fighting" was intended as the domain of individuals 
touched by		crime. The original design under the American legal order was to 
restore a		semblance of <I>private</I> justice. The courts were a mere forum, or 
avenue,		for private persons to attain justice from a malfeasor.<SUP>67</SUP> 
The slow		alteration of the criminal courts into a venue only for the 
<I>government's</I>		claims against private persons turned the very spirit of 
the Founders' model on		its head.</P>
<P>To suggest that modern policing is extraconstitutional is not to imply		that 
every aspect of police work is constitutionally improper.<SUP>68</SUP>		Rather, 
it is to say that the totality and effect of modern policing negates		the 
meaning and purpose of certain constitutional protections the Framers		intended 
to protect and carry forward to future generations. Modern-style		policing 
leaves many fundamental constitutional interests utterly		unenforced.</P>
<P>Americans today, for example, are far more vulnerable to invasive		searches 
and seizures by the state than were the Americans of		1791.<SUP>69</SUP> The 
Framers lived in an era in which much less of the world		was in "plain view" of 
the government and a "stop and frisk" would have been		rare indeed.<SUP>70</SUP> 
The totality of modern policing also places		pedestrian and vehicle travel at 
the mercy of the state, a development the		Framers would have almost certainly 
never sanctioned. These infringements		result not from a single aspect of modern 
policing, but from the whole of		modern policing's control over large domains of 
private life that were once		"policed" by private citizens.</P>
<P align="CENTER">THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTINCTIONS</P>
<P>The treatment of law enforcement in the courts shows that the law of		crime 
control has changed monumentally over the past two centuries. Under the		common 
law, there was no difference whatsoever between the privileges,		immunities, and 
powers of constables and those of private citizens. Constables		were literally 
and figuratively clothed in the same garments as everyone else		and faced the 
same liabilities — civil and criminal — as everyone		else under identical 
circumstances. Two centuries of jurisprudence, however,		have recast the power 
relationships of these two roles dramatically.</P>
<P>Perhaps the first distinction between the rights of citizen and		constabulary 
came in the form of increased power to arrest. Early in the		history of 
policing, courts held that an officer could arrest if he had		"reasonable belief 
both in the commission of a felony and in the guilt of the
		arrestee.<SUP>71</SUP> This represented a marginal yet important distinction
		from the rights of a "private person," who could arrest only if a felony had
		 <I>actually</I> been committed.<SUP>72</SUP> It remains somewhat of a 
mystery,		however, where this distinction was first drawn.<SUP>73</SUP> Scrutiny 
of the		distinction suggests it arose in England in 1827 — more than a 
generation		after ratification of the Bill of Rights in the United 
States.<SUP>74</SUP></P>
<P>Moreover, the distinction was illegitimate from its birth, being a
		bastardization of an earlier rule allowing constables to arrest upon
		transmission of reasonably reliable information from a third
		person.<SUP>75</SUP> The earlier rule made perfect sense when many arrests 
were		executed by private persons. "Authority" was a narrow defense available 
only to		those who met the highest standard of accuracy.<SUP>76</SUP> But when 
Americans		began to delegate their law enforcement duties to professionals, the 
law		relaxed to allow police to execute warrantless felony arrests upon 
information		received from third parties. For obvious reasons, constables could 
not be		required to be "right" all of the time, so the rule of strict liability 
for		false arrest was lost.<SUP>77</SUP></P>
<P>The tradeoff has had the effect of depriving Americans of certainty in		the 
executions of warrantless arrests. Judges now consider only the question of
		whether there was reasonable ground to suspect an arrestee, rather than 
whether		the arrestee was guilty of any crime. This loss of certainty, when 
combined		with greater deference to the state in most law enforcement matters, 
has		essentially reversed the original intent and purpose of American law
		enforcement that the state act against stern limitations and at its own peril.
		Because arrest has become the near exclusive province of professional police,
		Americans have fewer assurances that they are free from unreasonable
		arrests.</P>
<P>Distinctions between the privileges of citizens and police officers grew
		more rapidly in the twentieth century. State and federal lawmakers enshrined
		police officers with expansive immunities from firearm laws<SUP>78</SUP> and
		from laws regulating the use of equipment such as radio scanners, body armor,
		and infrared scopes.<SUP>79</SUP> Legislatures also exempted police from toll
		road charges,<SUP>80</SUP> granted police confidential telephone numbers and
		auto registration,<SUP>81</SUP> and even exempted police from fireworks
		regulations.<SUP>82</SUP> Police are also protected by other statutory
		immunities and protections, such as mandatory death sentences for defendants
		who murder them,<SUP>83</SUP> reimbursement of moving expenses when officers
		receive threats to their lives,<SUP>84</SUP> and even special protections from
		assailants infected with the AIDS virus.<SUP>85</SUP> Officers who illegally
		eavesdrop, wiretap, or intrude upon privacy are protected by a 
<I>statutory</I>		(as well as case law) "good faith" defense,<SUP>86</SUP> 
<I>while</I> private		citizens who do so face up to five years in prison. The 
tendency of		legislatures to equip police with ever-expanding rights, privileges 
and powers		has, if anything, been strengthened rather than limited by the
		courts.<SUP>88</SUP></P>
<P>But this growing power differential contravenes the principles of equal
		citizenship that dominated America's founding. The great principle of the
		American Revolution was, after all, the doctrine of limited
		government.<SUP>89</SUP> Advocates of the Bill of Rights saw the chief danger
		of government as the inherently aristocratic and disparate power of government
		authority.<SUP>90</SUP> Founding-era constitutions enunciated the principle
		that all men are "equally free" and that all government is derived from the
		people.<SUP>91</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">RESISTING ARREST</P>
<P>Nothing illustrates the modern disparity between the rights and powers		of 
police and citizen as much as the modern law of resisting arrest. At the		time 
of the nation's founding, any citizen <I>was privileged</I> to resist		arrest 
if, for example, probable cause for arrest did not exist or the		arresting 
person could not produce a valid arrest warrant where one was
		needed.<SUP>92</SUP> As recently as one hundred years ago, but with a tone 
that		seems as if from some other, more distant age, the United States Supreme 
Court		held that it was permissible (or at least defensible) to shoot an officer 
who		displays a gun with intent to commit a warrantless arrest based on 
insufficient		cause.<SUP>93</SUP> Officers who executed an arrest without proper 
warrant were		themselves considered trespassers, and any trespassee had a right 
to violently		resist (or even assault and batter) an officer to evade such
		arrest.<SUP>94</SUP></P>
<P>Well into the twentieth century, violent resistance was considered a		lawful 
remedy for Fourth Amendment violations.<SUP>95</SUP> Even third-party
		intermeddlers were privileged to forcibly liberate wrongly arrested persons
		from unlawful custody.<SUP>96</SUP> The doctrine of non-resistance against
		unlawful government action was harshly condemned at the constitutional
		conventions of the 1780s, and both the Maryland and New Hampshire 
constitutions		contained provisions denouncing nonresistance as "absurd, 
slavish, and		destructive of the good and happiness of 
mankind."<SUP>97</SUP></P>
<P>By the 1980s, however, many if not most states had (1) eliminated the		common 
law right of resistance,<SUP>98</SUP> (2) <I>criminalized the		 </I>resistance 
of any officer acting in his official capacity,<SUP>99</SUP> (3)		eliminated the 
requirement that an arresting officer present his warrant at the
		scene,<SUP>100</SUP> and (4) drastically decreased the number and types of
		arrests for which a warrant is required.<SUP>101</SUP> Although some state
		courts have balked at this march toward efficiency in favor of the
		state,<SUP>102</SUP> none require the level of protection known to the
		Framers.<SUP>103</SUP></P>
<P>But the right to resist unlawful arrest can be considered a
		 <I>constitutional</I> one. It stems from the right of every person to his
		bodily integrity and liberty of movement, among the most fundamental of all
		rights.<SUP>104</SUP> Substantive due process principles require that the
		government interfere with such a right only to further a compelling state
		interest<SUP>105</SUP> — and the power to arrest the citizenry unlawfully		can 
hardly be characterized as a compelling state interest.<SUP>106</SUP> Thus,		the 
advent of professional policing has endangered important rights of the		American 
people.</P>
<P>The changing balance of power between police and private citizens is
		illustrated by the power of modern police to use violence against the
		population.<SUP>107</SUP></P>
<P>As professional policing became more prevalent in the twentieth century,
		police use of deadly force went largely without clearly delineated guidelines
		(outside of general tort law).<SUP>108</SUP> Until the 1970s, police officers
		shot and killed fleeing suspects (both armed and unarmed) at their own
		discretion or according to very general department oral 
policies.<SUP>109</SUP>		Officers in some jurisdictions made it their regular 
practice to shoot at		speeding motorists who refused orders to halt.<SUP>110 
</SUP>More than one		officer tried for murder in such cases — along with fellow 
police who		urged dismissals — argued that such killings were in the discharge 
of		official duties.<SUP>111</SUP> Departments that adopted written guidelines
		invariably did so in response to outcries following questionable
		shootings.<SUP>112</SUP> Prior to 1985, police were given near total 
discretion		to fire on the public wherever officers suspected that a fleeing 
person had		committed a felony.<SUP>113</SUP> More than 200 people were shot and 
killed by		police in Philadelphia alone between 1970 and 1983.<SUP>114</SUP></P>
<P>In 1985, the United States Supreme Court purported to stop this carnage		by 
invalidating the use of deadly force to apprehend unarmed, nonviolent
		suspects.<SUP>115</SUP> <I>Tennessee v. Garner</I><SUP>116</SUP> involved the
		police killing of an unarmed juvenile burglary suspect who, if apprehended
		alive, would likely have been sentenced to probation.<SUP>117</SUP> The Court
		limited police use of deadly force to cases of self defense or defense of
		others.<SUP>118</SUP></P>
<P>As a practical matter, however, the <I>Garner</I> rule is much less
		stringent. Because federal civil rights actions inevitably turn not on a 
strict		constitutional rule (such as the <I>Garner</I> rule), but on the 
perception of		a defendant officer, officers enjoy a litigation advantage over 
all other		parties.<SUP>119</SUP> In no reported case has a judge or jury held 
an officer		liable who used deadly force where a mere "reasonable" belief that 
human life		was in imminent danger existed.<SUP>120</SUP> Some lower courts have
		interpreted <I>Garner</I> to permit deadly force even where suspects pose no
		immediate and direct threat of death or serious injury to 
others.<SUP>121</SUP>		The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently denied 
the criminal liability		of an agent who shot and killed an innocent person to 
prevent another person		from retreating to "take up a defensive position," 
drawing criticism from Judge		Kozinski that the court had adopted the "007 
standard" for police		shootings.<SUP>122</SUP></P>
<P>Untold dozens, if not hundreds, of Americans have been shot in the back
		while fleeing police, even after the <I>Garner</I> decision. Police have shot
		and killed suspects who did nothing more than make a move,<SUP>123</SUP> reach
		for their identification too quickly,<SUP>124</SUP> reach into a jacket or
		pocket,<SUP>125</SUP> "make a motion" of going for a gun,<SUP>126</SUP> turn
		either toward or away from officers,<SUP>127</SUP> 'pull away' from an officer
		as an officer opened a car door,<SUP>128</SUP> rub their eyes and stumble
		forward after a mace attack,<SUP>129</SUP> or allegedly lunge with a
		knife,<SUP>130</SUP> a hatchet,<SUP>131</SUP>or a ballpoint pen.<SUP>132</SUP>
		Cops have also been known to open fire on and kill persons who brandished or
		refused to drop virtually any hand-held object — a Jack Daniel's whiskey
		bottle,<SUP>133</SUP> a metal rod,<SUP>134</SUP> a wooden stick,<SUP>135</SUP>
		a kitchen knife (even while eating dinner),<SUP>136</SUP> a
		screwdriver,<SUP>137</SUP> a rake<SUP>138</SUP> — or even refused an order		to 
raise their hands.<SUP>139</SUP></P>
<P>Cops who shoot an individual holding a shiny object that can be said to
		resemble a gun — such as a cash box,<SUP>140</SUP> a shiny silver
		pen,<SUP>141</SUP> a TV remote control,<SUP>142</SUP> or even a can
		opener<SUP>143</SUP> — are especially likely to avoid liability. In line		with 
this defense, police officers nationwide have been caught planting weapons		on 
their victims in order to make shootings look like self		defense.<SUP>144</SUP> 
In one of the more egregious examples ever proven in		court, Houston police were 
found during the 1980s to have utilized an		unofficial <I>policy</I> of planting 
guns on victims of police		violence.<SUP>145</SUP> Seventy-five to eighty 
percent of all Houston officers		apparently carried "throw-down" weapons for 
such purposes.<SUP>146</SUP> Only		the dogged persistence of aggrieved relatives 
and the firsthand testimony of		intrepid witnesses unraveled the police cover-up 
of the		policy.<SUP>147</SUP></P>
<P>Resisting arrest, defending oneself, or fleeing may also place an		American 
in danger of being killed by police.<SUP>148</SUP> Although the law		clearly 
classifies such killings as unlawful, police are rarely made to account		for 
such conduct in court.<SUP>149 </SUP>Only where the claimed imminent threat
		seems too contrived — such as where an officer opened fire to defend		himself 
from a pair of fingernail clippers<SUP>150</SUP> — or where		abundant evidence 
of a police cover-up exists, will courts uphold damage awards		against police 
officers who shoot civilians.<SUP>151</SUP></P>
<P>As Professor Peter L. Davis points out, there is no good reason why		police 
should not be liable <I>criminally</I> for their violations of the		criminal 
code, just as other Americans would expect to be (and, indeed, as the
		constables of the Founding Era often were).<SUP>152</SUP> Yet in modern
		criminal courts, police tend to be more bulletproof than the Kevlar vests they
		wear on the job. Remember that the district attorneys responsible for
		prosecuting police for their crimes are the same district attorneys who must
		defend those officers in civil cases involving the same facts.<SUP>153</SUP>
		Under the Framers' common law, this conflict of interest did not arise at all
		because a citizen grand jury — independent from the state attorney general		 — 
brought charges against a criminal officer, and the officer's victim		prosecuted 
the matter before a petit jury.<SUP>154</SUP> But the modern model		of law 
enforcement provides no real remedy, and no ready outlet for the law to		work 
effectively against police criminals. Indeed, modern policing acts as an
		obstruction of justice with regard to police criminality.</P>
<P>The bloodstained record of shootings, beatings, tortures and mayhem by
		American police against the populace is too voluminous to be recounted in a
		single article.<SUP>155</SUP> At least 2,000 Americans have been killed at the
		hands of law enforcement since 1990.<SUP>156</SUP> Some one-fourth of these
		killings — about fifty per year — are alleged by some authorities to		be in 
the nature of murders.<SUP>157</SUP> Yet only a handful have led to		indictment, 
conviction and incarceration.<SUP>158</SUP> This is true even		though most 
police killings involve victims who were unarmed or committed no
		crime.<SUP>159</SUP></P>
<P>Killings by police seem as likely as killings by death-row murderers to
		demonstrate extreme brutality or depravity. Police often fire a dozen or more
		bullets at a victim where one or two would stop the individual.<SUP>160</SUP>
		Such indicia of viciousness and ferocity would qualify as aggravating factors
		justifying the death penalty for a civilian murderer under the criminal laws 
of		most states.<SUP>161</SUP></P>
<P>From the earliest arrival of professional policing upon America's		shores, 
police severely taxed both the largess and the liberties of the
		citizenry.<SUP>162</SUP> In early municipal police departments, cops tortured,
		harassed and arrested thousands of Americans for vagrancy, loitering, and
		similar "crimes," or detained them on mere "suspicion."<SUP>163</SUP> Where
		evidence was insufficient to close a case, police tortured suspects into
		confessing to crimes they did not commit.<SUP>164</SUP> In the name of law
		enforcement, police became professional lawbreakers, "constantly breaking in
		upon common law and ... statute law."<SUP>165</SUP> In 1903 a former New York
		City police commissioner remarked that he had seen "a dreary procession of
		citizens with broken heads and bruised bodies against few of whom was violence
		needed to affect an arrest.... The police are practically above the
		law."<SUP>166</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">THE SAFETY OF THE POLICE PROFESSION</P>
<P>Defenders of police violence often cite the dangerous nature of police		work, 
claiming the police occupation is filled with risks to life and health.		Police 
training itself — especially elite SWAT-type or paramilitary		training that many 
officers crave — reinforces the "dangerousness" of		police work in the officers' 
own minds.<SUP>167</SUP> There is some truth to		this perception, in that around 
one hundred officers are feloniously killed in		the line of duty each year in 
the United States.<SUP>168</SUP></P>
<P>But police work's billing as a dangerous profession plummets in		credibility 
when viewed from a broader perspective. Homicide, after all, is the		second 
leading cause of death on the job for <I>all</I> American
		workers.<SUP>169</SUP> The taxicab industry suffers homicide rates almost
		 <I>six times</I> higher than the police and detective industry.<SUP>170</SUP> 
A		police officer's death on the job is almost as likely to be from an accident 
as		from homicide.<SUP>171</SUP> When overall rates of injury and death on the 
job		are examined, policing barely ranks at all. The highest rates of fatal
		workplace injuries occur in the mining and construction industries, with
		transportation, manufacturing and agriculture following close
		behind.<SUP>172</SUP> Fully 98 percent of all fatal workplace injuries occur 
in		the civilian labor force.<SUP>173</SUP></P>
<P>Moreover, police work is generously rewarded in terms of financial,		pension 
and other benefits, not to mention prestige. Police salaries may exceed
		$100,000 annually plus generous health insurance and pension plans —		 placing 
police in the very highest percentiles of American workers in terms of
		compensation.<SUP>174</SUP> The founding generation would have been utterly
		astonished by such a transfer of wealth to professional law
		enforcers.<SUP>175</SUP> This reality of police safety, security and comfort 
is		one of the best-kept secrets in American labor.</P>
<P>In all, it is questionable whether modern policing actually decreases		the 
level of bloodshed on American streets. Police often bring mayhem,		confusion 
and violence wherever they are called.<SUP>176</SUP> Approximately		one-third of 
the people killed in high-speed police car chases (which are often
		unnecessarily escalated by police) are innocent bystanders.<SUP>177</SUP> Cops
		occasionally prevent rather than execute rescues.<SUP>178</SUP> "Police
		practices" ranked as the number one <I>cause</I> of violent urban riots of the
		1960s.<SUP>179</SUP> Indeed, police actively participated in or even initiated
		some of the nation's worst riots.<SUP>180</SUP> During the infamous Chicago
		Police Riot during the Democratic National Convention in 1968, police
		physically attacked 63 newsmen and indiscriminately beat and clubbed numerous
		innocent bystanders.<SUP>181</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">PROFESSIONALISM?</P>
<P>If the modern model of cop-driven criminal justice has any defense at		all, 
it is its "professionalism." Private law enforcement of the type intended		by 
the Framers was supposedly more inclined toward lax and arbitrary		enforcement 
than professional officers who are sworn to uphold the		law.<SUP>182</SUP> Upon 
scrutiny, however, the claim that professional police		are more reliable, less 
arbitrary, and more capable of objective law		enforcement than private law 
enforcers is drastically undermined.</P>
<P>The constitutional model of law enforcement (investigation by a citizen
		grand jury, arrest by private individuals, constables or citizens watch, and
		private prosecution) became seen as inefficient and ineffective as America
		entered its industrial age.<SUP>183</SUP> Yet the grand jury in its natural 
and		unhobbled state is <I>more</I>, rather than less, able to pursue 
investigations		when compared to professional police. Grand jurors are not 
constrained by the		Fourth, Fifth or Sixth amendments — or at least the 
"exclusionary rule"		fashioned by the courts to enforce those 
amendments.<SUP>184</SUP></P>
<P>In the absence of police troops to enforce the law, the early criminal
		justice system was hardly as hobbled and impotent as conventional wisdom
		suggests. Private watch groups and broad-based advocacy groups existed to
		enforce laws and track criminals among jurisdictions. Thousands of local
		antihorsethief associations and countless 'detecting societies' sprang up to
		answer the call of crime victims in the nineteenth century.<SUP>185</SUP> In
		Maine, the "Penobscot Temperance League" hired detectives to investigate and
		initiate criminal cases against illegal liquor traffickers.<SUP>186</SUP> In
		the 1870s a private group called the Society for the Suppression of Vice 
became		so zealous in garnering prosecutions of the immoral that it was accused 
in 1878		of coercing a defendant into mailing birth control information in 
violation of		federal statutes,<SUP>187</SUP> one of the earliest known 
instances of conduct		that later became defined as entrapment.<SUP>188</SUP> 
Although some of these		private crime-fighting groups were invested with limited 
state law enforcement		powers,<SUP>189</SUP> they were not police officers in 
the modern sense and		received no remuneration.</P>
<P>Such volunteer nonprofessionals continue to aid law enforcement as		auxiliary 
officers in many American communities.<SUP>190</SUP> Additionally,		private 
organizations affiliated with regional chambers of commerce,		neighborhood watch 
and other citizens' groups continue to play a substantial		 — though 
underappreciated — role in fighting crime.<SUP>191</SUP>		America also has a 
long history of outright vigilante justice, although such		vigilantism has been 
exaggerated both in its sordidness<SUP>192</SUP> and in		its 
scope.<SUP>193</SUP></P>
<P>Moreover, government-operated policing is hardly a monopoly even today,
		neither in maintaining order nor over matters of expertise and
		intelligence-gathering.<SUP>194</SUP> There are three times more private
		security guards than public police officers and even activities such as
		guarding government buildings (including police stations) and forensic 
analysis		are now done by private security personnel.<SUP>195</SUP></P>
<P>The chief selling point for professional policing seems to be the idea		that 
sworn government agents are more competent crime solvers than grand		juries, 
private prosecutors, and unpaid volunteers. But this claim		disintegrates when 
the realities of police personnel are considered. In 1998,		for example, forty 
percent of graduating recruits of the Washington, D.C.		police academy failed 
the comprehensive exam required for employment on the		force and were described 
as "practically illiterate" and		"borderline-retarded."<SUP>196</SUP> As a 
practical matter, police are more		dependent upon the public than the public is 
dependent upon		police.<SUP>197</SUP></P>
<P>Cops rely on the public for a very high percentage of their		investigation 
clearances. As the rate of crimes committed by strangers		increases, the rate of 
clearance by the police invariably		declines.<SUP>198</SUP> Roughly two-thirds 
of major robbery and burglary		arrests occur solely because a witness can 
identify the offender, the offender		is caught at or near the crime scene, or 
the offender leaves evidence at the		scene.<SUP>199</SUP> In contrast, where a 
suspect cannot be identified in such		ways, odds are high that the crime will go 
unsolved.<SUP>200</SUP></P>
<P>Studies show that as government policing has taken over criminal
		investigations, the rates of clearance for murder investigations have actually
		gone down. For more than three decades — while police units have expanded
		greatly in size, power and jurisdiction — the gap between the number of
		homicides in the United States and the number of cases solved has widened by
		almost twenty percent.<SUP>201</SUP> Today, almost three in ten homicides go
		unsolved.<SUP>202</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">DNA EVIDENCE ILLUSTRATES FALLIBILITY OF POLICE</P>
<P>Moreover, a surprisingly high number of police conclusions are simply		wrong. 
Since 1963, at least 381 <I>murder</I> convictions have been reversed		because 
of police or prosecutorial misconduct.<SUP>203</SUP> In the 25-year		period 
following the Supreme Court's ruling in <I>Gregg v.		Georgia</I><SUP>204</SUP> 
reaffirming the use of capital punishment, one		innocent person has been freed 
from death row for every seven who have been		executed.<SUP>205</SUP> In 
Illinois, Thirteen men have been freed from death		row since 1977 after proving 
their innocence — more than the twelve who		were actually put to death over the 
same period. Governor George Ryan finally		ordered a moratorium on executions 
until the death penalty system could be		revamped,<SUP>206</SUP> referring to 
the death penalty system as "fraught with		error."<SUP>207</SUP></P>
<P>Yet death penalty cases are afforded far more due process and scrutiny		of 
evidence than noncapital cases. If anything, the error rate of police in
		noncapital cases is likely substantially higher. Governor Ryan's words would
		seem to apply doubly to the entire system of police-driven investigation.</P>
<P>The advent of DNA analysis in the courtrooms of the 1990s greatly
		accelerated the rate at which police errors have been proven in court, even
		while avenues for defendants' appeals have been systematically cut off by
		Congress and state legislatures.<SUP>208</SUP> DNA testing before trial has
		exonerated at least 5000 <I>prime suspects</I> who would likely have otherwise
		been tried on other police evidence.<SUP>209</SUP> Often, exculpatory DNA
		revelations have come in cases where other police-generated evidence was
		irreconcilable, suggesting falsification of evidence or other police
		misconduct.<SUP>210</SUP> The sheer number of wrongly accused persons freed by
		DNA evidence makes it beyond dispute that police investigations are far less
		trustworthy than the public would like to believe.<SUP>211</SUP></P>
<P>Even more unjustified is the notion that a justice system powered by
		professional police possesses higher levels of integrity, trustworthiness and
		credibility than the criminal justice model intended by the Framers. Within 
the		criminal justice system, cops are regarded as little more than professional
		witnesses of convenience, if not professional perjurers, for the
		prosecution.<SUP>212</SUP> Almost no authority credits police with high levels
		of honesty. Indeed, the daily work of cops requires strategic lying as part of
		the job description.<SUP>213</SUP> Cops lie about the strength of their
		evidence in order to obtain confessions,<SUP>214</SUP> about giving
		 <I>Miranda</I> warnings to arrestees when on the witness stand,<SUP>215</SUP>
		and even about substantive evidence when criminal cases need more support. 
Cops		throughout the United States have been caught fabricating, planting and
		manipulating evidence to obtain convictions where cases would otherwise be 
very		weak.<SUP>216</SUP> Some authorities regard police perjury as so rampant 
that		it can be considered a "subcultural norm rather than an individual 
aberration"		of police officers.<SUP>217</SUP> Large-scale investigations of 
police units in		virtually every major American city have documented massive 
evidence tampering,		abuse of the arresting power, and discriminatory 
enforcement of laws according		to race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic 
status. Recent allegations in Los		Angeles charge that dozens of officers abused 
their authority by opening fire		on unarmed suspects, planting evidence, dealing 
illegal drugs, or framing some		200 innocent people.<SUP>218</SUP> More than a 
hundred prosecutions had to be		dismissed in Chicago in 1997 due to similar 
police misconduct.<SUP>219</SUP>		During the infamous "French connection" case 
of the 1970s, New York City		narcotics detectives were caught diverting 188 
pounds of heroin and 31 pounds		of cocaine for their own use, making the City's 
Special Investigating Unit the		largest heroin and cocaine dealer in the 
city.<SUP>220</SUP></P>
<P>Police criminality was so acute in New Orleans during the 1980s and		1990s 
that people were afraid to report crimes for fear that corrupt officers		would 
retaliate or tip off organized crime figures. One New Orleans officer was
		convicted of ordering the execution of a witness who reported him to the
		internal affairs unit for allegedly pistol-whipping a teenager.<SUP>221</SUP>
		Thirty-six Washington, D.C. officers were indicted on charges such as drug
		dealing, sexual assault, murder, sodomy and kidnapping in 1992.<SUP>222</SUP>
		 </P>
<P>In Detroit, repeated corruption allegations have seen a number of low-		and 
high-ranking officers go to prison for drug trafficking, hiring hit men,
		providing drug protection, and looting informant funds.<SUP>223</SUP> Police
		burglary rings have been uncovered in several cities.<SUP>224</SUP></P>
<P>Patterns of police abuse tend to repeat themselves in major American		cities 
despite endless attempts at reform.<SUP>225</SUP> New York City police,		for 
example, have been the subject of dozens of wide-ranging corruption probes		over 
the past hundred years<SUP>226</SUP> yet continue to generate corruption
		allegations.<SUP>227</SUP> Police exhibit unique levels of occupational
		solidarity.<SUP>228</SUP> Review boards and internal affairs commissions
		inevitably fail to penetrate police loyalty and find resistance from every
		rank.<SUP>229</SUP> Cops inevitably form an isolated authoritarian subculture
		that is both cynical toward the rule of law and disrespectful of the rights of
		fellow citizens.<SUP>230</SUP> The code of internal favoritism that holds
		police together may more aptly be described as syndicalism rather than
		professionalism. Historically, urban police "collected" from local
		businesses.<SUP>231</SUP> Today, a more subtle brand of racketeering prevails,
		whereby police assist those businesses which provide support for police and
		undermine businesses which are perceived as antagonistic to police interests.
		This same shakedown also applies to newspaper editors and
		politicians.<SUP>232</SUP></P>
<P>Even at the federal level, where national investigators presume to		police 
corruption and oversee local departments, favoritism toward the police		role is 
rampant. In 1992, for example, the federal government filed criminal		charges in 
only 27 cases of police criminality.<SUP>233</SUP> A federal statute
		criminalizing violations of the Fourth Amendment has never been enforced even 
a		single time, although it has been a part of the U.S. Code since
		1921.<SUP>234</SUP> Throughout the 1980s and '90s, the FBI Crime Laboratory
		actively abetted the misconduct of local police departments by misrepresenting
		forensic evidence to bolster police cases against 
defendants.<SUP>235</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">COPS NOT COST-EFFECTIVE DETERRENT</P>
<P>In terms of pure economic returns, police are a surprisingly poor public
		investment. Typical urban police work is very expensive because police see a
		primary part of their role as intervention for its own sake — poking,
		prodding and questioning the public in hope of turning up evidence of
		wrongdoing. Toward this end, police spin quick U-turns, drive slowly and
		menacingly down alleyways, reverse direction to track suspected scofflaws, and
		conduct sidewalk pat-down searches of potential criminals absent clear indicia
		of potential criminality.<SUP>236</SUP> Studies indicate, however, that such
		tactics are essentially worthless in the war on crime. One experiment found
		that when police do not 'cruise' but simply respond to dispatched calls, crime
		rates are completely unaffected.<SUP>237</SUP></P>
<P>Thus the very aspect of modern policing that the public view as most
		effective — the creation of a 'police presence' — is in fact a		monstrous 
waste of public resources.<SUP>238</SUP> Similarly, the history of		America's 
expenditures in the war on drugs provides little support for the		proposition 
that money spent on policing yields positive returns.<SUP>239</SUP>		University 
of Chicago professor John Lott has found that while hiring police		can reduce 
crime rates, the net benefit of hiring an additional officer is		about a quarter 
of the benefit from arming the public with an equivalent dollar		amount of 
concealed handguns.<SUP>240</SUP></P>
<P>There is no doubt that modern police are a creation of lawful		representative 
legislatures and are very popular with the general		public.<SUP>241</SUP> But 
the rights of Americans depend upon freedom <I>from		 </I>government as much as 
freedom <I>of</I> government.<SUP>242</SUP>		Constitutions must provide a 
countermajoritarian edifice to the threat posed by		the will of the masses, and 
courts must at times pronounce even the most		popular programs invalid when they 
contravene the fundamental liberties of a		minority — or even the whole people 
at times when they inappropriately		devalue their liberties.<SUP>243</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">PART II</P>
<P align="CENTER">POLICE AS A STANDING ARMY</P>
<P>It is largely forgotten that the war for American independence was		initiated 
in large part by the British Crown's practice of using troops to		police 
civilians in Boston and other cities.<SUP>244</SUP> Professional		soldiers used 
in the same ways as modern police were among the primary		grievances enunciated 
by Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence.		("[George III] has kept among 
us standing armies"; "He has affected to render		the military independent of and 
superior to the civil power"; "protecting them,		by a mock 
trial....").<SUP>245</SUP> The duties of such troops were in no way		military 
but involved the keeping of order and the suppression of crime		(especially 
customs and tax violations).</P>
<P>Constitutional arguments quite similar to the thesis of this article		were 
made by America's Founders while fomenting the overthrow of their		government. 
Thomas Jefferson proclaimed that although Parliament was supreme in		its 
jurisdiction to make laws, "his majesty has no right to land a single armed		man 
on our shores" to enforce unpopular laws.<SUP>246</SUP> James Warren said		that 
the troops in Boston were there on an unconstitutional mission because		their 
role was not military but rather to enforce "obedience to Acts which,		upon fair 
examination, appeared to be unjust and		unconstitutional."<SUP>247</SUP> 
Colonial pamphleteer Nicholas Ray charged that		Americans did not have "an Enemy 
worth Notice within 3000 Miles of		them."<SUP>248</SUP> "[T]he troops of George 
the III have cross'd the wide		atlantick, not to engage an enemy," charged John 
Hancock, but to assist		constitutional traitors "in trampling on the rights and 
liberties of [the		King's] most loyal subjects ..."<SUP>249</SUP></P>
<P>The use of soldiers to enforce law had a long and sullied history in		England 
and by the mid-1700s were considered a violation of the fundamental		rights of 
Englishmen.<SUP>250</SUP> The Crown's response to London's Gordon		Riots of 1780 
— roughly contemporary to the cultural backdrop of America's		Revolution — 
brought on an immense popular backlash at the use of guards		to maintain public 
order.<SUP>251</SUP> "[D]eep, uncompromising opposition to		the maintenance of a 
semimilitary professional force in civilian life" remained		integral to 
Anglo-Saxon legal culture for another half		century.<SUP>252</SUP></P>
<P>Englishmen of the Founding era, both in England and its colonies,		regarded 
professional police as an "alien, continental device for maintaining a
		tyrannical form of Government."<SUP>253</SUP> Professor John Phillip Reid has
		pointed out that few of the rights of Englishmen "were better known to the
		general public than the right to be free of standing armies."<SUP>254</SUP>
		"Standing armies," according to one New Hampshire correspondent, "have ever
		proved destructive to the Liberties of a People, and where they are suffered,
		neither Life nor Property are secure."<SUP>255</SUP></P>
<P>If pressed, modern police defenders would have difficulty demonstrating		a 
single material difference between the standing armies the Founders saw as so
		abhorrent and America's modern police forces. Indeed, even the distinctions
		between modern police and actual military troops have blurred in the wake of
		America's modern crime war.<SUP>256</SUP> Ninety percent of American cities 
now		have active special weapons and tactics (SWAT) teams, using such 
commando-style		forces to do "high risk warrant work" and even routine police
		duties.<SUP>257</SUP> Such units are often instructed by active and retired
		United States military personnel.<SUP>258</SUP></P>
<P>In Fresno, California, a SWAT unit equipped with battering rams,		chemical 
agents, fully automatic submachine guns, and 'flashbang' grenades		roams 
full-time on routine patrol.<SUP>259</SUP> According to criminologist		Peter 
Kraska, such military policing has never been seen on such a scale in		American 
history, "where SWAT teams routinely break through a door, subdue all		the 
occupants, and search the premises for drugs, cash and		weapons."<SUP>260</SUP> 
In high-crime or problem areas, police paramilitary		units may militarily engage 
an entire neighborhood, stopping "anything that		moves" or surrounding 
suspicious homes with machine guns openly		displayed.<SUP>261</SUP></P>
<P>Much of the importance of the standing-army debates at the ratification
		conventions has been overlooked or misinterpreted by modern scholars. 
Opponents		of the right to bear arms, for example, have occasionally cited the
		standing-army debates to support the proposition that the Framers intended the
		Second Amendment to protect the power of states to form 
militias.<SUP>262</SUP>		Although this argument has been greatly 
discredited,<SUP>263</SUP> it has		helped illuminate the intense distrust that 
the Framers manifested toward		occupational standing armies. The standing army 
the Framers most feared was a		soldiery conducting law enforcement operations in 
the manner of King George's		occupation troops — like the armies of police 
officers that now patrol the		American landscape.</P>
<P align="CENTER">THE SECOND AMENDMENT</P>
<P>The actual intent of the Second Amendment — that it protect a right		of 
people to maintain the means of violently checking the power of government		 — 
has been all but lost in modern American society.<SUP>264</SUP> Modern
		policing's increasing monopoly on firepower tends to undermine the Framers'
		intent that the whole people be armed, equipped, and empowered to resist the
		state. Many police organizations lobby incessantly for gun control, even 
though		the criminological literature yields scant empirical support for general 
gun		control as a crime-prevention measure.<SUP>265</SUP></P>
<P>Nor is there much legitimacy to the claim that professional police are		more 
accurate or responsible with firearms than the armed citizenry intended by		the 
Framers. To this day, civilians shoot and kill at least twice as many		criminals 
as police do every year,<SUP>266</SUP> and their 'error rate' is		several times 
lower.<SUP>267</SUP> In a government study of handgun battles		that lead to 
officer injuries, it was found that police who fired upon their		killers were 
less than half as accurate as their civilian, nonprofessional,
		assailants.<SUP>268</SUP></P>
<P>Moreover, police seem hardly less likely to misuse firearms than the		general 
public.<SUP>269</SUP> In New York City, where private possession of		handguns 
has been virtually eliminated for most civilians, problems with		off-duty police 
misusing firearms have repeatedly surfaced.<SUP>270</SUP> Los		Angeles police 
have been found to fire their weapons inappropriately in		seventy-five percent 
of cases.<SUP>271</SUP> Between early 1989 and late 1992,		more than one out of 
every seven shots fired by Washington, D.C. police		officers was fired 
accidentally.<SUP>272</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">THE THIRD AMENDMENT</P>
<P>Although standing armies were not specifically barred by the final		version 
of the Constitution's text, some authorities have pointed to the Third
		Amendment<SUP>273</SUP> as a likely fount for such a conceptual
		proposition.<SUP>274</SUP> Additionally, the Amendment's proscription of
		quartering troops in homes might well have been interpreted as a general
		anti-search and seizure principle if the Fourth Amendment had never been
		enacted.<SUP>275</SUP> The Third Amendment was inspired by sentiments quite
		similar to those that led to passage of the Second and Fourth Amendments,
		rather than fear of military operations. Writing in the 1830s, Justice Story
		regarded the Third Amendment as a security that "a man's house shall be his 
own		castle, privileged against all <I>civil</I> and military
		intrusion."<SUP>276</SUP></P>
<P>The criminal procedure concerns that dominated the minds of the Framers		of 
the Bill of Rights were created not only before the Revolution but also		after 
it. In the five years following British surrender, the independent states		vied 
against each other for commercial advantage, debt relief, and land claims.
		Conflict was especially fierce between the rival settlers of Pennsylvania and
		Connecticut on lands in the west claimed simultaneously by both
		states.<SUP>277</SUP> Both states sent partisan magistrates and troops into 
the		region, and each faction claimed authority to remove claimants of the rival
		state.<SUP>278</SUP> Magistrates occasionally ordered arrest without warrant,
		turned people out of their homes, and even ordered submission to the 
quartering		of troops in homes.<SUP>279</SUP> In 1784, a Pennsylvania grand jury 
indicted		one such magistrate and forty others for abuse of their
		authority.<SUP>280</SUP> Many agents had to be arrested before the troubles
		finally ended in 1788 — the very moment when the Constitution was		undergoing 
its ratification debates.<SUP>281</SUP> These troubles, and not		memories of 
life under the Crown, were fresh in the minds of the Framers who		proposed and 
ratified the Bill of Rights.</P>
<P>The Third Amendment's proscription of soldiers quartered in private		homes 
addressed a very real <I>domestic</I> concern about the abuse of state
		authority in 1791. This same fear of an omnipresent and all-controlling
		government is hardly unfounded in modern America. Indeed, the very evils the
		Framers sought to remedy with the entire Bill of Rights — the lack of
		security from governmental growth, control and power — have come back to
		haunt modem Americans like never before.<SUP>282</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">THE RIGHT TO BE LEFT ALONE</P>
<P>The 'police state' known by modern Americans would be seen as quite
		tyrannical to the Framers who ratified the Constitution. If, as Justice
		Brandeis suggested, the right to be left alone is the most important 
underlying		principle of the Constitution,<SUP>283</SUP> the cop-driven model of 
criminal		justice is anathemic to American constitutional principles. Today a 
vast and		omnipotent army of insurgents patrols the American landscape in place 
of grand		juries, private prosecutors, and the occasional constable. This 
immense		soldiery is forever at the beck and call of whatever social forces rule 
the		day, or even the afternoon.<SUP>284</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">THE FOURTH AMENDMENT</P>
<P>Now to the Fourth Amendment. The Amendment reads: "The right of the		people 
to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
		unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants
		shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and
		particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to
		be seized."<SUP>285</SUP> This protection was clearly regarded as one of the
		more important provisions of the Bill of Rights during debates in and out of
		Congress prior to ratification.<SUP>286</SUP> To this day, the Amendment is
		probably the most cited constitutional provision in challenges to police
		action.</P>
<P>The cold, hard reality, however, is that the interest protected by the
		amendment — security from certain types of searches and seizures —		 has been 
drastically scaled back since 1791. In saying this, I am mindful that		there are 
those among the highest echelons of the bench and academy who claim		that 
current Fourth Amendment law is <I>more protective</I> than the Framers
		intended.<SUP>287</SUP> Indeed, there are those claiming the mantles of
		textualism and originalism who would decrease Fourth Amendment rights even
		further.<SUP>288</SUP> The ever-influential Akhil Amar, for example, has 
argued		that the Fourth Amendment's text does not really <I>require</I> warrants 
but		merely lays out the evidentiary foundation required to <I>obtain</I>
		warrants.<SUP>289</SUP> Amar joins other "originalist" scholars who emphasize
		that the only requirement of the Fourth Amendment's first clause ("The right 
of		the people to be secure in their persons, papers, and effects from 
unreasonable		searches and seizures shall not be violated") is that all searches 
and seizures		be "reasonable."<SUP>290</SUP> The warrant requirement pronounced 
in many		Supreme Court opinions, according to Amar, places an unnecessary burden 
upon		law enforcement and should be abandoned for a rule Amar considers more 
workable		 — namely civil damages for unreasonable searches after the fact as
		determined by juries.</P>
<P>This type of "originalism" has appealed to more than one U.S. Supreme		Court 
justice,<SUP>291</SUP> at least one state high court,<SUP>292</SUP> and		various 
legal commentators.<SUP>293</SUP> Indeed, it has brought a perceivable		shift to 
the Supreme Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.<SUP>294</SUP> Even		the U.S. 
Justice Department has adopted this argument as its own in briefs		filed in the 
U.S. Supreme Court arguing for elimination of the warrant
		requirement.<SUP>295</SUP></P>
<P>The problem with this line of interpretation is that it does not square		with 
the original view of the Framers. Even the most cursory examination of		history 
reveals that law enforcers of the Founding Era, whether private		persons, 
sheriffs or constables, were obligated to procure warrants in many
		circumstances that modern courts do not require warrants.<SUP>296</SUP> The
		general rule that warrants were required for all searches and seizures except
		those involving circumstances of the utmost urgency seems so well settled at
		the time of ratification that it is difficult to imagine a scholar arguing
		otherwise.<SUP>297</SUP> But Professor Amar does. "Supporters of the warrant
		requirement," the professor writes, "have yet to find any cases" enunciating
		the warrant requirement before the Civil War.<SUP>298</SUP></P>
<P>Perhaps Amar has overlooked the 1814 case of <I>Grumon v. Raymond</I>,		in 
which the Connecticut Supreme Court held both a constable, who executed an
		improper search warrant, and a justice of the peace who issued the warrant,
		civilly liable for trespass.<SUP>299</SUP> The court in <I>Grumon</I> clearly
		stated that the invalidity of the search warrant left the search's legality 
"on		no better ground than it would be if [the search had been pursuant to] no
		process."<SUP>300</SUP> Or maybe Amar is unfamiliar with the 1807 case of
		 <I>Stoyel v. Lawrence</I>, holding a sheriff liable for executing a civil
		arrest warrant after the warrant's due date and declaring that the warrant
		"gave the officer no authority whatever, and, consequently, formed no
		defence";<SUP>301</SUP> or the 1763 Massachusetts case of <I>Rex v. Gay</I>,
		acquitting an arrestee for assaulting and beating a sheriff who arrested him
		pursuant to a facially invalid warrant;<SUP>302</SUP> or <I>Batchelder v.
		Whitcher</I>, holding an officer liable for ordering the seizure of hay by an
		unsealed warrant in 1838;<SUP>303</SUP> or <I>Conner v. Commonwealth</I>, in
		which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded in 1810 that if the requirement
		of warrants based on probable cause could be waived merely to allow constables
		to more easily arrest criminals, "the constitution is a dead
		letter."<SUP>304</SUP></P>
<P>Even the cases Amar cites for the proposition that search warrants were		not 
required under antebellum Fourth Amendment jurisprudence do not squarely
		support such a proposition.<SUP>305</SUP> Most of them merely repeat the
		"warrant requirement" of the common law and find that their given facts fit
		within a common law exception.<SUP>306</SUP> Similarly, the cases Amar cites
		that interpret various Fourth-Amendment equivalents of state constitutions by
		no means indicate that Founding-era law enforcers could freely search and 
seize		without warrant wherever it was "reasonable" to do so. <SUP>307</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">WARRANTS A FLOOR, NOT A CEILING</P>
<P>Under Founding-era common law, warrants were often considered as much a
		constitutional floor as a ceiling. Warrants did provide a defense for
		constables in most trespass suits, but were <I>not good enough</I> to immunize
		officials from liability for <I>some</I> unreasonable searches or
		seizures.<SUP>308</SUP> The most often-cited English case known to the Framers
		who drafted the Fourth Amendment involved English constabulary who had acted
		pursuant to a search warrant but were nonetheless found civilly liable for
		stiff (punitive, actually) damages.<SUP>309</SUP></P>
<P>For more than 150 years, it was considered <I>per se</I>		unconstitutional 
for law enforcers to search and seize certain categories of		objects, such as 
personal diaries or private papers, <I>even with perfectly		valid 
warrants</I>.<SUP>310</SUP> Additionally, Fourth Amendment jurisprudence
		prohibited the government from seizing as evidence any personal property which
		was not directly involved in crime, <I>even with a valid
		warrant</I>.<SUP>311</SUP><I></I> The rationale for this "mere evidence" rule
		was that the interests of property owners were superior to those of the state
		and could not be overridden by mere indirect evidentiary
		justifications.<SUP>312</SUP> This rule, like many other obstacles to police
		search and seizure power, was discarded in the second half of the twentieth
		century by a Supreme Court much less respectful of property rights than its
		predecessors.<SUP>313</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">PRIVATE PERSONS AND THE FOURTH AMENDMENT</P>
<P>Under the Founders' Model, a private person like Josiah Butler, who lost
		twenty pounds of good pork under suspicious circumstances in 1787, could
		approach a justice of the peace and obtain a warrant to search the property of
		the suspected thief for the lost meat.<SUP>314</SUP> Private individuals
		applied for many or most of the warrants in the Founders' era and even
		conducted many of the arrests.<SUP>315 </SUP>Even where sworn constables
		executed warrants, private persons often assisted them.<SUP>316</SUP> To avoid
		liability, however, searchers needed to secure a warrant before
		acting.<SUP>317</SUP> False arrest was subject to strict
		liability.<SUP>318</SUP></P>
<P>The Founders contemplated the enforcement of the common law to be a duty		of 
private law enforcement, and assumed that private law enforcers would		represent 
their interests with private means. However, the Founders viewed		private 
individuals executing law enforcement duties as "public authority" and		thus 
intended for the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to apply to such individuals		when 
acting in their law enforcement capacities.<SUP>319</SUP> Consequently,		the 
Supreme Court's 1921 decision in <I>Burdeau v. McDowell</I><SUP>320</SUP>		 — 
often cited for the proposition that the Fourth Amendment applies only		to 
government agents — was almost certainly either wrongly decided or		wrongly 
interpreted by later courts.<SUP>321</SUP></P>
<P>Some of the earliest English interpretations of the freedom from search		and 
seizure held the protection applicable to private citizens as much as or		more 
so than government agents.<SUP>322</SUP> Massachusetts and Vermont were
		apparently the first states to require that search and arrest warrants be
		executed by sworn officers.<SUP>323</SUP> New Hampshire adopted the same rule
		in 1826, more than a generation after the Bill of Rights was
		ratified.<SUP>324</SUP> It is likely that some states allowed private persons
		to execute search warrants well into the nineteenth century.</P>
<P>Because many Founding-era arrests and searches were executed by private
		persons, and early constables <I>needed</I> the assistance of private persons
		to do their jobs, the Fourth Amendment was almost certainly intended for
		application to private individuals. <I>Burdeau</I> cited no previous authority
		for its proposition in 1921, and early American cases demonstrate an original
		intent that the Fourth Amendment apply to every searcher acting under color of
		law.<SUP>325</SUP> On the open seas, most enforcement of prize and piracy laws
		was done by "privateers" acting for their own gain but who were held
		accountable in court for their misconduct.<SUP>326</SUP></P>
<P>Later courts have taken this holding to mean that "a wrongful search or
		seizure conducted by a private party does not violate the Fourth Amendment."
		Walter v. U.S. 447 U.S. 649, 656 (1979). <I>See also</I> United States v.
		Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113 (1984) (saying "This Court has also consistently
		construed this protection as proscribing only governmental action; it is 
wholly		inapplicable to a private individual not acting as an agent of the 
Government		or with the participation or knowledge of any government 
official.").</P>
<P>As explained in Part I, early constables had powers no greater than		those of 
other individuals, so they needed warrants before engaging in law		enforcement 
activities beyond any citizen's authority. Like you or I, a		constable would be 
thought outside the bounds of good etiquette (and well		outside the law) were he 
to conduct an unconsented search of another's person,		property or effects, and 
should — very reasonably — expect to be		jailed, physically repulsed, or sued 
for such conduct.</P>
<P>A private person's only defense was the absolute correctness of his
		allegations. A person was liable if, for example, his complaint was too vague
		as to the address to be searched,<SUP>327</SUP> he misspelled the name of the
		accused in his complaint,<SUP>328</SUP> or he sought the execution of a 
warrant		naming a "John Doe" as a target.<SUP>329</SUP></P>
<P>This was the constitutional model secured to America by the Framers. The
		idea of police having special powers was only a seedling, alien to the scheme
		of ordered liberty and limited government created by the Constitution.
		Eventually, police interceded between private individuals and magistrates
		altogether, and today it is virtually unheard of for a private person to seek 
a		search warrant from a magistrate.</P>
<P>Freedom from search and seizure has been retracting in favor of police		ever 
since the ink was dry on the Bill of Rights. The Framers lived under a		common 
law rule that required warrantless arrests be made only for felonies		where no 
warrant could be immediately obtained.<SUP>330</SUP> By the early to		mid-1800s, 
the rule had changed to allow warrantless arrests for all felonies		regardless 
of whether a warrant could be obtained.<SUP>331</SUP> Early American		courts 
also apparently allowed warrantless arrests for misdemeanor breaches of		peace 
committed in the arrestor's presence. Toward the end of the nineteenth		century, 
most state courts had changed to allow warrantless arrest for <I>all		crimes</I> 
of any kind committed in an officer's presence, as well as for all		felonies 
committed either within or without an officer's presence regardless of		whether 
a warrant can be obtained.<SUP>332</SUP></P>
<P>By the mid-1900s, arrest had become the almost-exclusive province of		paid 
police, and their power to arrest opened even wider. A trend toward		allowing 
police to arrest without warrant for all crimes committed even		 <I>outside</I> 
their presence has recently developed,<SUP>333</SUP> with little		foreseeable 
court-imposed impediment.<SUP>334</SUP> Almost every American		jurisdiction has 
legislated for the erosion of common law limitations with		regard to domestic 
violence arrests and arrests for other high profile
		misdemeanors.<SUP>335</SUP></P>
<P>Despite the Fourth Amendment, the Supreme Court has imposed almost no		limits 
on warrantless arrest at all. Only forcibly entering a residence without
		warrant to arrest someone inside has been found to violate the Fourth
		Amendment.<SUP>336</SUP> Outside the home, modern police have been essentially
		licensed by the Court to arrest almost anyone at any time so long as probable
		cause exists.<SUP>337</SUP> The Supreme Court effectively buried the original
		purpose of warrantless arrest entirely in 1985, declaring that "[r]estraining
		police action until after probable cause is obtained... might... enable the
		suspect to flee in the interim."<SUP>338</SUP></P>
<P>Long forgotten is the fact that common law allowance for warrantless		arrest 
was precipitated solely on an <I>emergency</I> rationale and allowed		only to 
protect the public from immediate danger.<SUP>339</SUP></P>
<P>The rationale for the felon exception to the warrant requirement in		1791, 
for example, was that a felony was any crime punishable by death,		generally 
thought to be limited to only a handful of serious		crimes.<SUP>340</SUP> Felons 
were considered "outlaws at war with		society,"<SUP>341</SUP> and their 
apprehension without warrant qualified as one		of the "exceptions justified by 
absolute necessity."<SUP>342</SUP> By the late		twentieth century, however, many 
crimes the Framers would have considered		misdemeanors or no crime at all had 
been declared felonies and the rationale		for immediate community action to 
apprehend "felons" had changed		greatly.<SUP>343</SUP> The courts, however, have 
been slow to react to this		far-reaching change.<SUP>344</SUP> In any case, the 
vast majority of arrests		(seventy to eighty percent) are for 
misdemeanors,<SUP>345</SUP> which would		have been proscribed without warrant 
under the Framers' law.</P>
<P align="CENTER">ORIGINALISTS CALL FOR CIVIL DAMAGES</P>
<P>The writings of most modern "originalist" scholars promote civil suits
		against police departments, instead of exclusion of evidence, as a remedy for
		police misconduct. Professor Amar, for example, champions a return to civil
		litigation, but with, somehow, a better return than such actions currently
		bring.<SUP>346</SUP> He invents a fantastically implausible cause of action
		where "government should generally not prevail."<SUP>347</SUP> He bases this
		idea on actual cases from the nineteenth century where people prevailed 
against		constables and sheriffs in relatively routine circumstances, often with 
heavy		damage awards.<SUP>348</SUP></P>
<P>These cases actually occurred — but in an age before police took		over 
American law enforcement. Civil damages really were a better remedy when		many 
or most searches were sought — and sometimes conducted — by		private persons who 
stood strictly liable in court if their allegations proved		false or their 
conduct proved overzealous.<SUP>349</SUP> American law provided		recovery for 
every false arrest. If it was not the constable who executed the		warrant, the 
private person, who lodged the original insufficient complaint,		was 
liable.<SUP>350</SUP></P>
<P>Under Founding-era common law, liability for officers was in many		respects 
<I>higher</I> than for private persons. Sheriffs and deputies could be		held 
liable for failing to arrest debtors for collection of debts<SUP>351</SUP>		or 
to serve other process,<SUP>352</SUP> for allowing an imprisoned debtor to
		escape,<SUP>353</SUP> for failing to keep entrusted goods secure<SUP>354</SUP>
		or to deliver goods in custody at a proper time,<SUP>355</SUP> or for failing
		to keep faithful accounting and custody of property.<SUP>356</SUP> Sheriffs
		were also obligated to return writs within a specific time period, at pain of
		civil damages.<SUP>357</SUP> They were liable to debtors whose property was
		sold at sheriffs sales if proper advertisement procedures were not
		followed<SUP>358</SUP> and for negligently allowing other creditors to obtain
		priority interests on attached property.<SUP>359</SUP></P>
<P>Law enforcers were liable for false imprisonment, even where they acted		with 
court permission, if procedures were improper.<SUP>360</SUP> A deputy was
		liable for damages to an arrestee whom he arrested outside his
		jurisdiction.<SUP>361</SUP> Sheriffs were even liable if their deputies
		executed civil process in a rude and insolent manner.<SUP>362</SUP> When
		executing writs, sheriffs were liable for any unnecessary violence against
		innocent third persons who obstructed them.<SUP>363</SUP></P>
<P>The Founders' law knew no "good faith" defense for law enforcers.		Sheriffs 
and justices who executed arrests pursuant to invalid warrants were		considered 
trespassers (as were any judges who granted invalid warrants). Any		person was 
justified in resisting, or even battering, such		officers.<SUP>364</SUP> 
Justices of the peace could be held liable for ordering		imprisonment without 
taking proper steps.<SUP>365</SUP></P>
<P>Any party who sued out or issued process did so at his peril and was		civilly 
responsible for unlawful writs (even if the executing officer acted in		good 
faith)<SUP>366</SUP></P>
<P>Nor did state authority provide the umbrella of indemnification that now
		protects public officers. Sheriffs of the nineteenth century often sought
		protection from liability by obtaining bonds from private
		sureties.<SUP>367</SUP> Their bonds were used to satisfy civil judgments
		against them while in office.<SUP>368</SUP> If the amount of their bonds was
		insufficient to satisfy judgments, sheriffs were liable
		personally.<SUP>369</SUP> It was not uncommon for a sheriff to find himself in
		jail as a debtor for failing to satisfy judgments against him.<SUP>370</SUP>
		Even punitive damages against officers — long disfavored by modern courts
		with regard to municipal liability — were deemed proper and normal under		the 
law of the Framers.<SUP>371</SUP></P>
<P>Unlike the early constables, uniformed police officers were generally
		introduced upon the American landscape by their oaths alone and without bonds.
		Their municipal employers (hence, the taxpayers) were on the hook for their
		civil liabilities. Although courts tended to treat police identically to 
bonded		officials,<SUP>372</SUP> their susceptibility to civil redress was much 
lower.		This change in the law of policing had the effect of depriving Americans 
of		remedies for Fourth Amendment (and other) violations.<SUP>373</SUP> The evil
		that now pervades criminal justice — swarms of officers unaccountable in
		court either criminally or civilly — was the very evil that the Founders
		sought to remedy in the late eighteenth century.<SUP>374</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">DEVELOPMENT OF IMMUNITIES</P>
<P>But immunities follow duties, and duties placed upon police by lawmakers
		have exploded since 1791.<SUP>375</SUP> Immunities grew slowly, beginning with
		a slight deference to officer conduct so long as there was no bad faith,
		corruption, malice or "misbehavior,"<SUP>376</SUP> and ending with broad
		qualified immunity.<SUP>377</SUP> When the practice of professional policing
		arrived from England upon American shores (for the second time, actually, if 
we		consider modern police to be akin to the "standing armies" of the Founders'
		generation), cases began to enunciate a general deference to police conduct,
		permitting that the actions of officers in carrying out their duties "not to 
be		harshly judged."<SUP>378</SUP> Appellate courts began to reverse jury 
verdicts		against officers upon new rules of law granting privileges unknown to 
private		individuals.<SUP>379</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">THE LOSS OF PROBABLE CAUSE, AND THE ONSET OF PROBABLE
		SUSPICION</P>
<P>Probable cause for the issuance of warrants has also become less
		strict.<SUP>380</SUP> The Supreme Court regarded hearsay evidence as
		insufficient to constitute probable cause for seventeen years in the first 
half		of the twentieth century,<SUP>381</SUP> but has since given police free 
reign		to construct probable cause in whatever way they deem proper. Instead of
		 <I>probability</I> that a crime has been committed, the courts now require 
only		some possibility, a relaxed standard that "robs [probable cause] of 
virtually		all operative significance."<SUP>382</SUP> This watered-down 
"probable cause"		for the issuance of ex parte warrants would have shocked the
		Founders.<SUP>383</SUP></P>
<P>At common law, one could sue and recover damages from a private person		who 
swore out a false or misleading search warrant affidavit.<SUP>384 </SUP>In
		contrast, few modern officers will ever have to account for lies on warrant
		applications so long as they couch their "probable cause" in unprovables.
		"Anonymous citizen informants,"<SUP>385</SUP> material omissions and
		misrepresentations,<SUP>386</SUP> irrelevant or prejudicial
		information,<SUP>387</SUP> and even outright falsities are now common fixtures
		of police-written search warrant applications.<SUP>388</SUP> For years, Boston
		police simply made up imaginary informants to justify searches and
		seizures.<SUP>389</SUP> Police themselves refer to the phenomenon as
		"testilying" — an aspect of normal police work regarded as "an open		secret" 
among principle players of the criminal justice		systern.<SUP>390</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">POLICE AND THE "AUTOMOBILE EXCEPTION"</P>
<P>The courts have been particularly unkind to Fourth Amendment protections		in 
the context of motor vehicle travel. Since the 1920s, Fourth Amendment
		jurisprudence has allowed for a gaping and ever-widening exception to the
		warrant requirement with regard to the nation's roadways.<SUP>391</SUP> Today,
		police force untold millions of motorists off the roads each year to be
		searched or scrutinized without judicial warrant of any kind.<SUP>392</SUP> 
Any		police officer can generally find some pretext to justify a stop of any
		automobile.<SUP>393</SUP> In effect, road travel itself is subject to a near
		total level of police control,<SUP>394</SUP> a phenomenon that would have
		confounded the Framers, who treated seizures of wagons, horses and buggies as
		subject to the same constraints as seizures of other property.<SUP>395</SUP>
		 </P>
<P>The courts have laid down such a malleable latticework of exceptions in
		favor of modern police that virtually any cop worth his mettle can adjust his
		explanations for a search to qualify under one exception or another. When no
		exception applies, police simply lie about the facts.<SUP>396</SUP> "Judges
		regularly choose to accept even blatantly unbelievable police
		testimony."<SUP>397</SUP> The practice on the streets has long been for police
		to follow their hunches, seek entrance at every door, and then attempt to
		justify searches after the fact.<SUP>398</SUP> Justice Robert Jackson observed

revealed		to the courts or the public because the searches turn up

<P align="CENTER">ONE EXCEPTION: THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE?</P>
<P>Conventional wisdom suggests there is one important exception to the		long 
decline of Fourth Amendment protections: the exclusionary rule. Since		1914, the 
Supreme Court has required the exclusion of evidence seized in		violation of the 
Fourth Amendment from being used against a defendant in		federal court.<SUP>400 
</SUP>In 1961, this rule was applied to the states in		 <I>Mapp v. 
Ohio</I>.<SUP>401</SUP> Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court		expanded the 
exclusionary rule to other protections such as the Fifth and Sixth		Amendments 
in cases such as <I>Miranda v. Arizona</I>.<SUP>402</SUP></P>
<P>Textualists and originalists have lobbed a steady stream of vitriol		against 
the exclusionary rule for decades. No enunciation of such a rule, say		these 
critics, can be found in the writings or statements of the
		Framers.<SUP>403</SUP> Moreover, say such critics, the rule places a heavy
		burden on the efficiency of police (but simultaneously, somehow, fails to 
deter		them in any way), and unfairly frees a small but not insignificant 
percentage		of "guilty" offenders.<SUP>404</SUP> So-called "conservative" legal 
scholars		remember the Warren Court's imposition of the exclusionary rule upon 
the states		in the 1960s as a bare-knuckled act of judicial 
activism<SUP>405</SUP> and		argue that the Court "[took] it upon itself, 
<I>without constitutional		authorization</I>, to police the 
police."<SUP>406</SUP></P>
<P>The <I>Miranda</I> and <I>Mapp</I> decisions provoked an onslaught of
		hostility by police organizations and their sympathizers that has not subsided
		decades later. High-ranking authorities (not the least of which were Justices
		Harlan and White, who dissented in <I>Miranda)</I> wrote that such decisions
		put society at risk from criminals.<SUP>407</SUP> The <I>Miranda</I> rule,
		according to Justice White, would force "those who rely on the public 
authority		for protection" to "engage in violent self-help with guns, knives and 
the help		of their neighbors similarly inclined."<SUP>408</SUP> Even more 
outraged was		the chief of police of Garland, Texas, who responded, "We might as 
well close		up shop."<SUP>409</SUP></P>
<P>Yet the dire predictions that followed the <I>Miranda</I> and		 <I>Mapp</I> 
decisions were ultimately proved false.<SUP>410</SUP> Rather than		returning to 
what Justice White decried as "violent self-help" (as the		Constitution's 
framers truly intended), America continued its slide into		increased dependence 
upon police for the most mundane aspects of law		enforcement. If anything, 
reliance upon police for personal protection has		increased since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>I propose an altogether different interpretation of <I>Mapp</I>,
		 <I>Miranda</I>, and some of the Warren Court's other criminal procedure
		decisions. While I concede that this jurisprudence grossly violated certain
		constitutional principles (most importantly, principles of federalism), I
		submit that such rulings were attempts to bring constitutional law into accord
		with the alien threat posed by modern policing. Professional policing's 
arrival		upon the American scene required that the Court's Bill of Rights 
jurisprudence		splinter a dozen ways to accommodate it. Thus, <I>Mapp</I> and 
<I>Miranda</I>		were an application of brakes to a foreign element (modern 
policing) that is		itself <I>without constitutional authorization</I>.</P>
<P>In many ways, the Warren Court was the first U.S. Supreme Court to face
		criminal procedural questions squarely in light of the advent of professional
		policing. The <I>Miranda</I> and <I>Mapp</I> decisions, according to noted
		criminal law expert David Rudovsky, "at least implicitly acknowledged
		widespread police and prosecutorial abuse,"<SUP>411</SUP> a phenomenon that
		would have bedeviled the Framers. <I>Mapp's</I> holding was brought on more by
		the need to make the criminal justice system work fairly than by any other
		consideration.<SUP>412</SUP> The same realities gave way to the rule of
		 <I>Bivens v. Six Narcotics Agents</I>, in 1971, in which the Court conceded
		that an agent acting illegally in the name of the government possesses a far
		greater capacity for harm than any individual trespasser exercising his own
		authority (as prevailed as the common form of law enforcement in
		1791).<SUP>413</SUP></P>
<P>Furthermore, the notion that exclusion cannot be justified under an
		originalist approach is not nearly as well-founded as its harshest critics
		suggest.<SUP>414</SUP> Critics of the rule point to the 1914 case of <I>Weeks
		v. United States</I><SUP>415</SUP> as the rule's debut in Supreme Court
		jurisprudence.<SUP>416</SUP> However, the rule actually debuted in dicta in 
the		1886 case of<I> Boyd v. United States</I>.<SUP>417</SUP> Even this 
seemingly		late date of the rule's debut can be attributed to the Court's lack 
of criminal		appellate jurisdiction until the end of the nineteenth 
century.<SUP>418</SUP>		The reality is that <I>Boyd</I>, the Court's first 
suggestion of the rule,		represents, for practical purposes, the <I>very first 
Fourth Amendment case		 </I>decided by the Supreme Court. The exclusionary rule 
thus has a better		pedigree than it is credited with.<SUP>419</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">THE FIFTH AMENDMENT</P>
<P>In a previous article, I described the limitation of common law grand		jury 
powers by Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as an
		unconstitutional infringement of the Fifth Amendment Grand Jury
		Clause.<SUP>420</SUP> The fact that most criminal charges are now initiated 
not		by crime victims but by armed state agents who serve the state's interests
		represents a drastic alteration of Founding-era criminal
		procedure.<SUP>421</SUP> The suppression of grand jurors' lawful powers belies
		the intent of the Constitution that law enforcement officials be subject to
		stringent oversight by the citizenry through grand juries. Modern policing, in
		effect, acts as a middleman between the people and the judicial branch of
		government that was never contemplated by the Framers.</P>
<P>The Fifth Amendment also prohibits the compulsion of self-incriminating
		testimony.<SUP>422</SUP> Various competing interpretations ebbed and flowed
		from this provision until 1966, when the Supreme Court held that police are
		required to actually tell suspects about the Fifth and Sixth Amendments'
		protections before interrogating them.<SUP>423</SUP> The sheer volume of
		criticism by police organizations of the <I>Miranda</I> ruling over the next
		three decades indicates the strong state interest in keeping the 
Constitution's		protections concealed from the American public.</P>
<P>Modem police interrogation could scarcely have been imagined by the		Framers 
who met in Philadelphia in the late eighteenth century. Police tactics		such as 
falsifying physical evidence, faking identification lineups,		administering fake 
lie detector tests and falsifying laboratory reports to		obtain confessions are 
methods developed by the <I>professionals</I> of the		twentieth century. 
<SUP>424</SUP> Against such methods a modern suspect stands		little chance of 
keeping his tongue. Like the exclusionary rule and the		entrapment defense, the 
<I>Miranda</I> rule operates as an awkward leveling		device between the rights 
of American citizens and their now-leviathanic		government.</P>
<P>In 2000, the Supreme Court upheld (indeed, "constitutionalized") the
		 <I>Miranda</I> rule in the face of widespread predictions that the
		police-favoring Rehnquist majority would abandon the rule.<SUP>425</SUP> The
		Court delivered an opinion recognizing that "the routine practices of [police]
		interrogation [is] itself a relatively new development."<SUP>426</SUP> The
		 <I>Miranda</I> requirement, according to Justice Rehnquist, was therefore
		justified as an extension of <I>due process</I> — a far more sustainable
		course than one extending from the wording of the Fifth and Sixth
		Amendments.<SUP>427</SUP></P>
<P>The <I>Dickerson</I> decision illustrates the increasingly awkward peace
		between the Bill of Rights and the phenomenon of modern policing. Because the
		Framers did not contemplate wide-scale execution of government power through
		paid, full-time agents, modern jurisprudence reconciling the Bill of Rights
		with today's police practices seems increasingly farfetched. Justices Scalia
		and Thomas dissented from the <I>Dickerson</I> majority with well-founded
		textualist objections, arguing that the majority was writing a "prophylactic,
		extraconstitutional Constitution" to protect the public from
		police.<SUP>428</SUP> Yet in light of the extraconstitutional nature of modern
		police, the <I>Dickerson</I> majority opinion is no less consistent with the
		Framers' constitutional intent.</P>
<P align="CENTER">DUE PROCESS</P>
<P>Due process of law depends upon assurances that a level playing field		exists 
between rival adversaries pitted against each other.<SUP>429</SUP> The
		constitutional design pitted a citizen defendant against his citizen accuser
		before a jury of his (the defendant's) peers. The state provided only the
		venue, the process, and assurances that the rule of law would govern the
		outcome. By comparison, a modern defendant is hardly pitted in a fair fight,
		facing the vast treasury and human resources of the state. While the criminal
		justice system of the Founding era was victim-driven, and thus self-limiting,
		today's system is fueled by a professional army of police who measure their
		success in numbers of arrests and convictions.<SUP>430</SUP></P>
<P>Police themselves often ignore standard concepts of fairness, official
		regulations, and statutes in their war on crime.<SUP>431</SUP> Police agencies
		have even been known to develop institutional means to circumvent court
		attempts to equalize the playing field.<SUP>432</SUP> In the face of unwanted
		publicity or controversy surrounding police brutality cases, police 
departments		have been known to release arrest records to the media to vilify 
victims of		police misconduct.<SUP>433</SUP></P>
<P>The police model of law enforcement tilts the entire system of criminal
		justice in favor of the state. The police, though supposedly neutral
		investigators, are in reality an arm of the prosecutor's office.<SUP>434</SUP>
		Where police secure a crime scene for investigation, they in fact secure it<I>
		for the prosecution</I> alone and deny access to anyone other than the
		prosecution. A suspect or his defense attorneys often must obtain court
		permission to view the scene or search for evidence. Only such exculpatory
		evidence as by accident falls into the hands of the prosecution need be
		revealed to the suspect or defendant.<SUP>435</SUP> In cases where police
		misconduct is an issue, police use their monopoly over the crime scene to
		prepare the evidence to suit their version of events.<SUP>436</SUP></P>
<P><I>Mapp</I>, <I>Miranda</I> and <I>Dickerson</I> notwithstanding, the
		tendency of modern courts to work around police practices, rather than nullify
		or restrain them, poses the very threat to due process of law the Framers saw
		as most dangerous to liberty. Instead of viewing the system as a true
		adversarial contest with neutral rules, judges and lawmakers have decided that
		catching (nonpolice) lawbreakers is more important than maintaining a code of
		integrity.<SUP>437</SUP> The "sporting theory of criminal justice," wrote
		Justice Warren Burger, "has been experiencing a decline in our
		jurisprudence."<SUP>438</SUP> In its place is a system where the government
		views the nonpolice lawbreaker as a threat to its authority and places top
		priority on defeating him in court.<SUP>439</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">ENTRAPMENT</P>
<P>Abandonment of victim-driven, mostly private prosecution has led to
		consequences the Framers could never have predicted and would likely never 
have		sanctioned. Even in the most horrific examples of colonial criminal 
justice		(and there were many), defendants were rarely if ever entrapped into 
criminal		activity. The development of modern policing as an omnipotent power of 
the		state, however, has necessitated the simultaneous development of 
complicated		doctrines such as entrapment and "outrageous government conduct" as
		counterweights.</P>
<P>It was not until the late nineteenth century that any English or		American 
case dealt with entrapment as a true defense to a criminal
		charge.<SUP>440</SUP> (The case law until then had been virtually devoid of
		police conduct issues altogether).<SUP>441</SUP> Beginning in 1880, English
		case law slowly became involved with phenomena such as state agents inducing
		suspects to sell without proper certificates,<SUP>442</SUP> persuading
		defendants to supply drugs to terminate pregnancy,<SUP>443</SUP> and enticing
		people to commit other victimless crimes. Dicta in some English cases 
expressed		outrage that police might someday "be told to commit an offense 
themselves for		the purpose of getting evidence against someone."<SUP>444</SUP> 
Police who		commit such offenses, said one English court, "ought also to be 
convicted and		punished, for the order of their superior would afford no
		defense."<SUP>445</SUP></P>
<P>Entrapment did not arise as a defense in the United States until 1915,		when 
the conduct of government officers for the first time brought the issue		before 
the federal courts. In <I>Woo Wai v. United States</I>, the Ninth		Circuit 
overturned a conviction of a defendant for illegally bringing Chinese		persons 
into the United States upon evidence that government officers had		induced the 
crime.<SUP>446</SUP> Growth in police numbers and "anti-crime"		warfare was so 
rapid that in 1993, the Wyoming Supreme Court wrote that		entrapment had 
"probably replaced ineffectiveness of defense counsel and		challenged conduct of 
prosecutors as the most prevalent issues in current		appeals."<SUP>447</SUP></P>
<P>The growth of the use of entrapment by the state raises troubling		questions 
about the nature and purposes of American government. Rather than		"serving and 
protecting" the public, modern police often serve and protect the		interests of 
the state against the liberties and interests of the people. A		significant 
amount of police brutality, for example, seems aimed at mere		philosophical, 
rather than physical, opposition. Police dominance over the		civilian (rather 
than service to or protection of him) is the "only truly iron		and inflexible 
rule" followed by police officers.<SUP>448</SUP> Thus, any		person who defies 
police faces virtually certain negative repercussions,		whether a ticket, a 
legal summons, an arrest, or a bullet.<SUP>449</SUP> One		study found nearly 
half of all illegal force by police occurred in response to		mere defiance of an 
officer rather than a physical threat.<SUP>450</SUP></P>
<P>In the political sphere, police serve the interests of those in power
		 <I>against</I> the rights of the public. New York police of the late 
nineteenth		century were found by the New York legislature to have committed 
"almost every		conceivable crime against the elective franchise," including 
arresting and		brutalizing opposition-party voters, stuffing ballot boxes, and 
using		"oppression, fraud, trickery [and] crime" to ensure the dominant party 
held the		city.<SUP>451</SUP> In the twentieth century, J. Edgar Hoover's FBI 
agents		burglarized hundreds of offices of law-abiding, left-wing political 
parties and		organizations, "often with the active cooperation or tacit consent 
of local		police."<SUP>452</SUP> The FBI has also spent thousands of man-hours 
surveiling		and investigating writers, playwrights, directors and artists whose 
political		views were deemed a threat to the interests of the ruling political
		establishment.<SUP>453</SUP></P>
<P>Police today are a constant agent on behalf of governmental power. Both		in 
the halls of legislatures and before the courts, police act as lobbyists
		against individual liberties.<SUP>454</SUP> Police organizations, funded by
		monies funneled directly from police wages, lobby incessantly against
		legislative constraints on police conduct.<SUP>455</SUP> Police organizations
		also file <I>amicus curie</I> briefs in virtually every police procedure case
		that goes before the Supreme Court, often predicting dire consequences if the
		Court rules against them. In 2000, for example, the police lobby filed
		 <I>amicus</I> briefs in favor of allowing police to stop and frisk persons 
upon		anonymous tips, warning that if the Court ruled against them, "the 
consequence		for law enforcement and the public could be increased assaults and 
perhaps even		murders."<SUP>456</SUP></P>
<P align="CENTER">CONCLUSION</P>
<P>The United States of America was founded without professional police.		Its 
earliest traditions and founding documents evidenced no contemplation that		the 
power of the state would be implemented by omnipresent police forces. On		the 
contrary, America's constitutional Framers expressed hostility and contempt		for 
the standing armies of the late eighteenth century, which functioned as law
		enforcement units in American cities. The advent of modern policing has 
greatly		altered the balance of power between the citizen and the state in a way 
that		would have been seen as constitutionally invalid by the Framers. The
		implications of this altered balance of power are far-reaching, and should
		invite consideration by judges and legislators who concern themselves with
		constitutional questions.</P>

		Figures for earlier decades and centuries are difficult to obtain, but a few

<P><SUP>11</SUP> As a textual matter, the Constitution grants authority to		the 
federal government to define and punish criminal activity in only five
		instances. Article I grants Congress power (1) "[t]o provide for the 
Punishment		of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United 
States," art.		I, § 8, cl. 6; (2) "[t]o define and punish Piracies and Felonies

Legislation in all		Cases whatsoever, over" the District of Columbia and federal 
reservations.		 <I>id</I>. at cl. 17; <I>see also</I> Cohens v. Virginia, 19 
U.S. (6 Wheat.)		264, 426 (1821) ("Congress has a right to punish murder in a 
fort, or other		place within its exclusive jurisdiction; but no general right to 
punish murder		committed within any of the states"). Likewise, (5) Article III 
defines the		crime of "Treason against the United States" and grants to Congress 
the "Power		to declare [its] Punishment...." U.S. CONST. art. III, § 3.</P>
<P><SUP>12</SUP> Several early constitutions expressed a right of citizens		"to 
be protected in the enjoyment of life, liberty and property," and therefore
		purported to bind citizens to contribute their proportion toward expenses of
		such protection. <I>See</I> DELAWARE DEC. OF RIGHTS of Sept. 11, 1776, §		10; 
PA. CONST. of Sept. 28, 1776, Dec. of Rights, § VIII; VT. CONST. of		July 8, 
1777, Chap. 1, § IX. Other typical provisions required that the		powers of 
government be exercised only by the consent of the people, <I>see,		e.g</I>., 
N.C. CONST. of Dec. 18, 1776, § V, and that all persons invested		with 
government power be accountable for their conduct. <I>See</I> MD. CONST.		of 
Nov. 11, 1776, § IV.</P>
<P><SUP>13</SUP> The constitutions of several early states expressed the		intent 
that citizens were obligated to carry out law enforcement duties.		 <I>See, 
e.g</I>., DELAWARE DEC. OF RIGHTS of Sept. 11, 1776, § 10		(providing every 
citizen shall yield his personal service when necessary, or an		equivalent); 
N.H. CONST. of June 2, 1784, Part I, art. I, § XII (providing		that every member 
of the community is bound to "yield his personal service when		necessary, or an 
equivalent"); VT. CONST. of July 8, 1777, Chap. 1, § IX		(providing every member 
of society is bound to contribute his proportion		towards the expenses of his 
protection, "and to yield his personal service,		when necessary").</P>

<P><SUP>15</SUP> Originally, all criminal procedure fell under the rule of
		private vengeance. A victim or aggrieved party made a direct appeal to county
		authorities to force a defendant to face him.</P>
<P><I>See</I> ARTHUR TRAIN, THE PRISONER AT THE BAR 120 n. (1926). From		these 
very early times, "grand" or "accusing" juries were formed to examine the

		jury frequently acted as a trial jury as well, it eventually evolved into a

200 (Conn. 1790) (holding action for assault and battery was no		more than a 
civil case because the public was not joined). It was apparently		not unusual

civil, and to make judicial errors regarding procedural differences		between the 
two types of cases. <I>See</I> Meacham v. Austin, 5 Day 233 (Conn.		1811)

<P><SUP>67</SUP> Private prosecution was not without costs to taxpayers.		The 
availability of free courtrooms to air grievances tended to promote		litigation. 
In 1804, the Pennsylvania legislature acted to allow juries to make		private 
prosecutors pay the costs of prosecution in especially trifling cases.		Act of 
Dec. 8, 1804 PL3, 4 Sm L 204 (repealed 1860). Private persons were		thereafter 
liable for court costs if they omitted material exculpatory		information from a 
grand jury, thereby causing a grand jury to indict without		knowledge of 
potential defenses. <I>See</I> Commonwealth v. Harkness, 4 Binn.		194 (Pa. 
1811). This protection, like many others, was lost when police and		public 
prosecutors took over the criminal justice system in the twentieth		century. 
<I>See</I> United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36 (1992) (holding		prosecutor 
has no duty to present exculpatory evidence to grand jury).</P>
<P><SUP>68</SUP> In the American constitutional scheme, the states have
		'general jurisdiction,' meaning they may regulate for public health and 
welfare		and enact whatever means to enforce such regulation as is necessary and
		constitutionally proper. <I>See, e.g</I>., Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. 
Transit		Auth., 469 U.S. 528 (1985), National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 
U.S. 833		(1976) (both standing for the general proposition that states have

		life for their citizens). <I>See also</I> Lawrence Tribe, American
		Constitutional Law, §§ 6-3, 7-3 (2d ed. 1988). State and municipal		police

<P><SUP>118</SUP> The <I>Garner</I> decision has been interpreted in		different 
ways by different courts and law-making bodies. <I>See</I> Michael R.		Smith, 
<I>Police Use of Deadly Force: How Courts and Policy-Makers Have		Misapplied 
Tennessee v. Garner</I>, 1 KAN. J. L. &amp; PUB. POL'Y, 100, 100-01		(1998). 
Smith argues that many of these interpretations stem from inaccurate		readings 
of <I>Garner</I> and that lower courts have failed to hold police		officers 
liable according to the standard required by the Supreme Court. <I>See
		id</I>.</P>
<P><SUP>119<I></I> </SUP> On behalf of modern police, courts have adopted a
		qualified immunity defense to police misconduct claims. Essentially, where 
cops		can justify by plausible explanation that their conduct was within the 
bounds		of their occupational duties, there is a "good faith" defense. 
<I>See</I>		Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982); Procunier v. Navarette, 
434 U.S. 555		(1978); Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409 (1976); Wood v. 
Strickland, 420 U.S.		308 (1975). But as David Rudovsky points out, the "good 
faith" defense is an		artificial ingredient to normal tort liability. "The 
standard rule," notes		Rudovsky, "is that a violation of another's rights or the 
failure to adhere to		prescribed standards of conduct constitutes grounds for 
liability." David		Rudovsky, <I>The Criminal Justice System and the Role of the 
Police, in</I> THE		POLITICS OF LAW: A PROGRESSIVE CRITIQUE, 242, 248 (David 
Kairys ed., 1982). The		"good faith" defense for police is thus an artificial 
layer of tort immunity		protection not normally available to other types of 
litigants. Under the		standard rules of tort law, after all, a defendant's good 
faith, intent, or		knowledge of the law are irrelevant. <I>See id</I>. at 248.

COMMISSION		ON THE CAUSES AND PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE, VIOLENCE IN AMERICA: 
HISTORICAL AND		COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVES 97 (Graham &amp; Gurr, dir. 1969). 
Arguably, such		offenders qualified as felons and would have faced the death 
penalty under the		common law even if more conventional court processes were 
followed. That such		vigilante movements often followed rudimentary due process 
of law is attested		by historians such as Richard Maxwell Brown, who recounts 
that "vigilantes'		attention to the spirit of law and order caused them to 
provide, by their		lights, a fair but speedy trial." Richard Maxwell Brown, 
<I>supra</I> note 189,		at 164. The northern Illinois Regulator movement of 
1841, for example, provided		accused horse thieves and murderers with a lawyer, 
an opportunity to challenge		jurors, and an arraignment. <I>See id</I>. at 163. 
At least one accused		murderer was <I>acquitted</I> by a vigilante court on the 
Wyoming frontier.		 <I>See</I> Joe B. Frantz, <I>The Frontier Tradition: An 
Invitation to Violence,		in </I>NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE CAUSES AND PREVENTION 
OF VIOLENCE, VIOLENCE		IN AMERICA: HISTORICAL AND COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVES 
129-30 (Graham &amp; Gurr,		dir. 1969). Many accused were let off with whipping 
and expulsion rather than		execution in the early decades of vigilante justice. 
<I>See</I> Brown,		 <I>supra</I> note 189, at 164. Less than half of all 
vigilante groups ever		killed anyone. <I>See id</I>. Ironically, the move by 
vigilante groups toward		killing convicted suspects began in the 1850s, — 
corresponding closely		with the meteoric rise of professional policing. <I>See 
id</I>.</P>
<P>Vigilante movements occasionally developed to <I>rescue</I> the law from
		corrupt public officials who were violating the law. The case of the 
vigilantes		who arrested and hanged Sheriff Henry Plummer of Virginia City, 
Montana in 1864		is such an example. <I>See</I> LEW L. CALLAWAY, MONTANA'S 
RIGHTEOUS HANGMEN		(1997) (arguing the vigilantes had no choice but to take the

<I>supra</I> note 192, at 128. Vigilante movements did little more than		play 
catch-up to what can only be described as rampant frontier lawlessness.
		Five-thousand wanted men roamed Texas in 1877. <I>See id</I>. at 128. Major
		crimes often went totally unprosecuted and countless offenders whose crimes
		were well known lived openly without fear of arrest on the western frontier.

<P><SUP>302</SUP> 1761-1772 Quincy Mass. Reports (1763). Perhaps Amar's
		statement can be read as a commentary on the dearth of originalist scholarship
		among those who support strong protections for criminal suspects and
		defendants. "Originalism" as a means of constitutional interpretation is not
		always definable in a single way, and "originalists" may often contradict each
		other as to their interpretation of given cases. <I>See</I> Richard S. Kay,
		 <I>"Originalist" Values and Constitutional Interpretation</I>, 19 HARV. J.L.
		&amp; PUB. POL'Y 335 (1995). Professor Kay has identified four distinct
		interpretive methods as being "originalist" — any two of which might		produce 
differing conclusions: 1) original text, 2) original intentions, 3)		original 
understanding, and 4) original values. <I>See id</I>. at 336. This		being 
conceded, originalism has generally been the domain of "conservative"		jurists 
for the past generation, fueled by reactions to the methods of		adjudication 
employed by the Warren Court. <I>See id</I>. at 335.</P>
<P><SUP>303</SUP> 9 N.H. 239 (1838).</P>
<P><SUP>304</SUP> 3 Bin. 38, 43 (Pa. 1810).</P>
<P><SUP>305</SUP> Admittedly, two of Amar's cited cases present troubling
		statements of the law. The rule of Amar's first case, <I>Jones v. Root</I>, 72
		Mass. 435 (1856), is somewhat difficult to discern. Although the case may be
		read as a total rejection of required warrants (as Amar contends, <I>supra
		 </I>note 287, at 4-5 n.10), it may also be read as an adoption of the "in the
		presence" exception to the warrant requirement known to the common law. The
		court's opinion is no more than a paragraph long and merely upholds the
		instruction of a lower court that a statute allowing warrantless seizure of
		liquors was constitutional. <I>Jones</I>, 72 Mass. at 439. The opinion also
		upheld the use of an illustration by the trial judge that suggested the 
seizure		was similar to a seizure of stolen goods observed <I>in the 
presence</I> of an		officer. <I>See id</I>. at 437.</P>
<P>A second case may also be read to mean that the government may search		and 
seize without warrant, but might also be read as enunciating the "breach of
		peace" exception to the warrant requirement. <I>Mayo v. Wilson</I>, 1 N.H. 53
		(1817) involved a town tythingman who seized a wagon and horses of an apparent
		teamster engaged in commercial delivery on the Sabbath, in violation of a New
		Hampshire statute. Amar quotes <I>Mayo's</I> pronouncement that the New
		Hampshire Fourth-Amendment equivalent "does not seem intended to restrain the
		legislature ..." But elsewhere in the opinion, the New Hampshire Supreme Court
		stated that an arrest <I>required</I> a "warrant in law" — either a
		magistrate's warrant, or excusal by the commission of a felony or breach of
		peace. <I>Mayo</I>, 1 N.H. at 56. "[B]ut if the affray be over, there <I>must
		be an express warrant." Id</I>. (emphasis added). Not much support for Amar's
		thesis there.</P>
<P><I>Mayo</I> was decided only fourteen years after the dawn of judicial
		review in <I>Marbury v. Madison, 5</I> U.S. 137 (1803), during an era when the
		constitutional interpretations of legislatures were thought to have equal
		weight to the interpretations of the judiciary. <I>Cf</I>. HENRY J. ABRAHAM,
		THE JUDICIAL PROCESS 335-40 (7<SUP>th</SUP> ed. 1998) (describing the slow
		advent of the concept of judicial review). Indeed, the first act of a state
		legislature to be declared unconstitutional came only seven years earlier,
		 <I>see</I> Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. 87 (1810), and the first state court
		decision invalidated by the Supreme Court had come only one year earlier.
		 <I>See</I> Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304 (1816). The very heart of 
the		 <I>Mayo</I> decision that Amar relies on (the proposition that state
		legislatures have concurrent power of constitutional review with the 
judiciary)		was so thoroughly discredited soon afterward that Amar's 
extrapolation that		Founding era courts did not require warrants seems 
exceedingly far-fetched.		 </P>
<P>As judicial review gathered sanction, the doctrine apparently enunciated		in 
<I>Mayo</I> became increasingly discredited. <I>See</I> Ex Parte Rhodes, 79		So. 
462 (Ala. 1918) (saying "[t]here is not to be found a single authority,
		decision, or textbook, in the library of this court, that sanctions the
		doctrine that the legislature, a municipality, or Congress can determine what
		is a 'reasonable' arrest").</P>
<P><SUP>306</SUP> Amar cites six cases (all referred to in <I>United States		v. 
Watson</I>, 423 U.S. 411 (1976)), as standing for the proposition that state
		Fourth Amendment equivalents did not presume a warrant requirement. AMAR,
		 <I>supra</I> note 287, at 5 n. l1. The first case, <I>State v. Brown</I>, 5
		Del. (5 Harr.) 505 (Ct. Gen. Sess. 1853), is difficult to reconcile with 
Amar's		thesis that antebellum courts recognized no warrant requirement. 
<I>Brown</I>		upheld a <I>criminal</I> verdict against a night watchman who 
entered a		residence in pursuit of a fleeing chicken thief and instead falsely 
arrested		 — without warrant — the proprietor. The second case cited by Amar,
		 <I>Johnson v. State</I>, 30 Ga. 426 (1860), simply upheld a guilty verdict
		against a man who shot a policeman during a warrantless arrest for being an
		accomplice to a felony. The Georgia Supreme Court repeated the common law
		exception allowing that an officer may arrest felons without warrant. The 
third		case, <I>Baltimore &amp; O. R.R. Co. v. Cain</I>, 81 Md. 87, 31 A. 801 
(1895),		merely reversed a civil jury verdict for an arrestee on grounds that 
the		appellant railroad company was entitled to a jury instruction allowing for 
a		breach-of-peace exception to the warrant requirement. The fourth case, 
<I>Reuck		v. McGregor</I>, 32 N.J.L. 70 (Sup. Ct. 1866), reversed a civil 
verdict on		grounds of excessive damages — while <I>upholding civil 
liability</I> for		causing warrantless arrest of an apparently wrongly-accused 
thief. <I>Holley v.		Mix</I>, 3 Wend. 350 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1829), Amar's fifth 
case, offers little		support for Amar's thesis. <I>Holley</I> upheld a civil 
judgment against a		private person and an officer who arrested a suspect 
pursuant to an invalid		warrant. Finally, <I>Wade v. Chaffee</I>, 8 R.I. 224 
(1865), simply held that a		constable was not bound to procure a warrant where 
he had probable cause to		believe an arrestee was guilty of a felony, even 
though no fear of escape was		present.</P>
<P><SUP>307</SUP> Amar cites four cases as standing for the proposition		that 
state courts interpreted their state constitutional predecessors of the		Fourth 
Amendment's text as requiring no warrants for searches or seizures.		AMAR, supra 
note 287, at 5 n.10. <I>Jones v. Root</I>, 72 Mass. (6 Gray) 435		(1856), upheld 
a Massachusetts "no-warrant" statute in a one-paragraph opinion		explained 
<I>supra</I> note 306. In <I>Rohan v. Sawin</I>, 59 Mass. (5 Cush.)		281 (1850), 
Massachusetts' highest court found that a warrantless arrest		qualified under 
the "felon" exception to the warrant requirement. <I>Mayo v.		Wilson</I>, 1 N.H. 
53 (1817), is described <I>supra</I> note 306.</P>
<P>Finally, the 1814 Pennsylvania case of <I>Wakely v. Hart, 6</I> Binn.		316 
(Pa. 1814), resolved a civil suit brought by an accused thief (Wakely)		against 
his arresters upon grounds that the arrest had been warrantless and		Wakely had 
been guilty only of a misdemeanor. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court		upheld a 
jury's verdict for the arresters, upon the rather-fudged finding that		Wakely 
had fled from the charges against him and had been guilty of at least		"an 
offence which approaches very near to a felony," if not an actual felony.

<I>See</I> AMAR, <I>supra</I> note 287, at 12. The ratification debates		made it 
clear that no method of curbing "the insolence of office" worked as		well as 
juries giving "ruinous damages whenever an officer has deviated from		the rigid 
letter of the law, or been guilty of any unnecessary act of insolence		or 
oppression." Maryland Farmer, <I>Essays by a Farmer</I> (1), <I>reprinted in

Punitive		damages were apparently common in search and seizure trespass cases, 
and		provided "an invaluable maxim" for securing proper and reasonable conduct 
by		public officers. Today, however, municipalities never have to pay out 
punitive		damages. <I>See</I> Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 271

<P><SUP>373</SUP> Many Founding-Era constitutions contained statements
		declaring a right of remedy for every person. <I>See, e.g</I>., DEL. CONST. of
		1776, § 12 (providing that "every freeman for every injury done him in his
		goods, lands or person, by any other person, ought to have remedy by the 
course		of the law of the land"); MASS. CONST. of 1780, art. I, § XI (providing
		"Every subject of the commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having
		recourse to the laws, for all injuries or wrongs"); N.H. CONST. of 1784, part
		I, § XIV (stating "Every subject of this state is entitled to a certain
		remedy"). Some early proposals for the national Bill of Rights also included
		such remedy provisions. <I>See, e.g</I>., Proposed Amended Federal
		Constitution, April 30, 1788, <I>reprinted in</I> THE ORIGIN OF THE SECOND
		AMENDMENT: A DOCUMENTARY HISTORY OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS 1787-1792 790, 791

		officer immunity is provided in <I>Seaman v. Patten</I>, 2 Cai. R. 312 (N.Y.
		Sup. Ct. 1805). Early tax and custom enforcement agents were unsworn
		volunteers, having "generally received a portion of the spoil." <I>Id</I>. at
		315. Corresponding to this system, such agents acted at their own peril and
		were civilly liable for their every impropriety. This "hard rule" of high
		officer liability was still in force a generation after the Constitution was
		ratified, although courts began to hold officers less accountable for their
		mistakes when officers became sworn to perform certain ever-more-difficult

<P><SUP>383</SUP> <I>See</I> AMAR, <I>supra</I> note 287, at 20. Judges of		the 
Founding era appear to have been somewhat more reluctant than modern judges		to 
issue search and seizure warrants. For an early example of judicial scrutiny		of 
warrant applications, see <I>United States v. Lawrence</I>, 3 U.S. 42 (1795)
		(upholding refusal of district judge to issue warrant for arrest of French
		deserter in the face of what government claimed was probable cause). Today,
		search warrant applications are rarely denied. The "secret wiretap court"
		established by Congress to process wiretap applications in 1978, has rejected
		only one wiretap request in its 22-year life. <I>See</I> Richard Willing,

<P><SUP>391</SUP> The 1920's saw an explosion of police privilege to		oversee 
two separate — but often interrelated — elements of American		life: Prohibition 
and the automobile. <I>See</I> FRIEDMAN, <I>supra</I> note58,		at 300 (saying 
search and seizure became a particularly salient issue during		Prohibition). In 
1925, the Supreme Court, by split decision, released an		opinion that would grow 
within the next 75 years into an immense expansion of		police prerogatives while 
at the same time representing an enormous loss of		personal security for 
American automobile travelers. <I>Carroll v. United		States</I> upheld a 
warrantless search of an automobile for liquor as valid		under the infamous 
Volstad Act, enacted to breathe life into the Eighteenth		Amendment. 267 U.S. 
137 (1925). The Carroll opinion led lower courts to more		than one 
interpretation, <I>see</I> Francis H. Bohlen &amp; Harry Shulman,		 <I>Arrest 
With and Without a Warrant</I>, 75 U. Pa. L. Rev. 485, 488-89 (1927)		, but 
slowly became recognized as a pronouncement of an "automobile exception"		to the 
warrant requirement. <I>See</I> United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 822
		(1982).</P>
<P>Two decades after <I>Carroll</I>, Justice Robert H. Jackson tried in		earnest 
to force the genie back into the bottle by narrowing the automobile		exception 
to cases of serious crimes, but a 7-2 majority outnumbered him.		 <I>See</I> 
Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 180-81 (1949) (Jackson, J.,
		dissenting). Since <I>Brinegar</I>, the "automobile exception" has been a
		fixture of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, and has greatly expanded. The
		automobile exception now accounts for the broadest umbrella of warrant
		exceptions. <I>See, e.g</I>., California v. Acevedo, 500 U.S. 565 (1991)
		(allowing warrantless search of containers in automobiles even without 
probable		cause to search the vehicle as a whole). Indeed, the automobile 
exception has		expanded so far that it has made a mockery of Fourth Amendment 
doctrine. As		Justice Scalia pointed out in his <I>Acevedo</I> concurrence, an 
anomaly now		exists protecting a briefcase carried on the sidewalk from 
warrantless search		but allowing the same briefcase to be searched without 
warrant if taken into a		car. <I>Acevedo</I> at 581 (Scalia, J., 
concurring).</P>
<P><SUP>392</SUP> Police surveillance of American roadways has brought the		bar 
of justice far closer to most Americans than ever before. Few accounts of		the 
sheer scale of traffic stops are available, but anecdotal evidence suggests
		traffic encounters with police number in the hundreds of millions annually. In
		North Carolina alone, more than 1.2 million traffic infractions were recorded
		in a single year. <I>See</I> FRIEDMAN, <I>supra</I> note 58, at 279. Of actual
		traffic stops, no reliable estimate can be made.</P>

<P><SUP>394</SUP> In <I>Delaware v. Prouse</I>, 440 U.S. 648 (1979), the

		justice (Rehnquist) arguing that cops may do so. <I>Prouse</I>, 440 U.S. at

<P><SUP>398</SUP> Prior to the imposition of the exclusionary rule in		 <I>Mapp

<P><SUP>418</SUP> <I>See</I> AMAR, <I>supra</I> note 287, at 146		(explaining 
that the Supreme Court reported very few criminal cases of any kind		until the 
end of the 1800's).</P>
<P><SUP>419</SUP> In the course of researching other matters for this		article, 
I stumbled across a small number of <I>pre-Boyd</I> cases appearing to		stand 
for variations of the exclusionary rule. <I>See</I> In re May, 1 N.W.		1021 
(Mich. 1879) (ordering release of prostitute arrested without warrant);		People 
v. Crocker, 1 Mich. 31 (1869) (ordering discharge of defendant arrested		by 
unsigned warrant); Commonwealth v. Foster, 1 Mass. 488 (1805) (overturning
		jury's guilty verdict where defendants were arrested pursuant to faulty arrest
		warrant); State v. J.H., 1 Tyl. 444 (Vt. 1802) (ordering discharge of person
		arrested upon warrant where no clear evidence of complainant's oath appeared).
		 </P>
<P>The earliest case I discovered to mention the question of exclusion was
		 <I>Frisbie v. Butler</I>, 1 Kirby 213 (Conn. 1787), a case that preceded the
		Bill of Rights by four years. <I>Frisbie</I> found a warrant plainly illegal,
		but stated "yet, how far this vitiates the proceedings upon the arraignment,
		may be a question, which is not necessary now to determine." <I>Id</I>. at 
215.		While this case by no means applied the rule of exclusion, it quite 
clearly		establishes that exclusion was a consideration in the minds of 
Founding-era		judges.</P>
<P>And while the rules of the above cases are subject to interpretation,		they 
at least stand for the proposition that an unlawful seizure, by itself,		has an 
impact on a subsequent criminal prosecution. This rule is actually far		more 
favorable to criminal defendants than modern Supreme Court allows. See New		York 
v. Harris, 495 U.S. 14 (1990) (holding that police may detain a suspect		even 
though they improperly arrested him); Frisbie v. Collins, 342 U.S. 519		(1952) 
(holding an invalid arrest is not a defense to the offense charged).		 </P>
<P>I cannot believe that my list of cases is in any way exhaustive. While I
		have not undertaken any systematic study of this matter, the cases I cite
		suggest to me that the exclusionary rule (or some remedial rule quite similar
		to the exclusionary rule) may have far stronger historical roots than it is
		credited with.</P>
