<CENTER><STRONG>An Act To Provide For The More Efficient Government Of The Rebel 
States</STRONG></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P><I>Whereas</I>, no legal State governments or adequate protection for life or 
property now exists in the rebel States of Virginia, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas; and 
whereas, it is necessary that peace and good order should be enforced in said 
States until loyal and republican State governments can be legally established; 
Therefore - <BR><BR><I>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in Congress assembled</I>, That said rebel 
States shall be divided into military districts and made subject to the military 
authority of the United States as hereinafter prescribed; and for that purpose 
Virginia shall constitute the first district; North Carolina and South Carolina 
the second district; Georgia, Alabama, and Florida the third district; 
Mississippi and Arkansas the fourth district; and Louisiana and Texas the fifth 
district.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 2.</STRONG><I> And be it further enacted</I>, That 
it shall be the duty of the President to assign to the command of each of said 
districts an officer of the army not below the rank of brigadier general, and to 
detail a sufficient military force to enable such officer to perform his duties 
and enforce his authority within the district to which he is 
assigned.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 3.</STRONG> <I>And be it further enacted</I>, That 
it shall be the duty of each officer assigned as aforesaid to protect all 
persons in their rights of person and property, to suppress insurrection, 
disorder, and violence, and to punish, or cause to be punished, all disturbers 
of the public peace and criminals, and to this end he may allow local civil 
tribunals to take jurisdiction of and to try offenders, or, when in his judgment 
it may be necessary for the trial of offenders, he shall power to organize 
military commissions or tribunals for that purpose, and all interference, under 
color of State authority, with the exercise of military authority under this 
act, shall be null and void.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 4. </STRONG><I>And be it 
further enacted,</I> That all persons put under military arrest by virtue of 
this act shall be tried without unnecessary delay, and no cruel or unusual 
punishment shall be inflicted; and no sentence of any military commission or 
tribunal hereby authorized, affecting the life or liberty of any person, shall 
be executed until it is approved by the officer in command of the district, and 
the laws and regulations for the government of the army shall not be affected by 
this act, except in so far as they conflict with its provisions; Provided, That 
no sentence of death, under the provisions of this act, shall be carried into 
effect without the approval of the President.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 5. 
</STRONG><I>And be it further enacted</I>, That when the people of any one of 
said rebel States shall have formed a constitution of government in conformity 
with the Constitution of the United States in all respects, framed by a 
convention of delegates elected by the male citizens of said State twenty-one 
years old and upward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition, who have 
been resident in said State for one year previous to the day of such election, 
except such as may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion, or for 
felony at common law; and when such constitution shall provide that the elective 
franchise shall be enjoyed by all such persons as have the qualifications herein 
stated for electors of delegates; and when such constitution shall be ratified 
by a majority of the persons voting on the question of ratification who are 
qualified as electors for delegates; and when such constitution shall have been 
submitted to Congress for examination and approval, and Congress shall have 
approved the same; and when said State, by a vote of its legislature elected 
under said constitution, shall have adopted the amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress, and known as article 
fourteen; and when said article shall have become a part of the Constitution of 
the United States, said State shall be declared entitled to representation in 
Congress, and senators and representatives shall be admitted therefrom on their 
taking the oath prescribed by law; and then and thereafter the preceding 
sections of this act shall be inoperative in said State; Provided, That no 
person excluded from the privilege of holding office by said proposed amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States shall be eligible to election as a 
member of the convention to frame a constitution for any of said rebel States, 
nor shall any such person vote for members of such 
convention.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 6. </STRONG><I>And be it further enacted</I>, 
That until the people of said rebel States shall be by law admitted to 
representation in the Congress of the United States, any civil government which 
may exist therein shall be deemed provisional only, and in all respects subject 
to the paramount authority of the United States at any time to abolish, modify, 
control, or supersede the same; and in all elections to any office under such 
provisional governments all persons shall be entitled to vote, and none others, 
who are entitled to vote under the fifth section of this act; and no person 
shall be eligible to any office under any provisional governments who would be 
disqualified from holding office under the provisions of the third article of 
said constitutional amendment.<BR><BR>SCHUYLER COLFAX<BR>Speaker of the House of

"An Act To Provide For The More Efficient Government Of The Rebel States", 
Passed March Second, Eighteen Hundred And Sixty-Seven, And To Facilitate 
Restoration</STRONG></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P><I>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled</I>, That before the first day of 
September, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, the commanding general in each 
district defined by an act entitled "An act to provide for the more efficient 
government of the rebel States", passed March second, eighteen hundred and 
sixty-seven, shall cause a registration to be made of the male citizens of the 
United States, twenty-one years of age and upwards, resident in each county or 
parish in the State or States included in his district, which registration shall 
include only those persons who are qualified to vote for delegates by the act 
aforesaid, and who shall have taken and subscribed the following oath or 
affirmation: "I, __________, do solemnly swear, (or affirm), in the presence of 
Almighty God, that I am a citizen of the State of __________; that I have 
resided in said State for __________ months next preceding this day, and now 
reside in the county of __________, or the parish of __________, in said State, 
(as the case may be); that I am twenty-one years old; that I have not been 
disfranchised for participation in any rebellion or civil war against the United 
States, nor for felony committed against the laws of any State or of the United 
States; that I have never been a member of any State legislature, nor held any 
executive or judicial office in any State engaged in insurrection or rebellion 
against the United States, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof; that 
I have never taken an oath as a member of Congress of the United States, or as 
any officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as 
an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of 
the United States, and afterwards engaged in insurrection or rebellion against 
the United States, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof; that I will 
faithfully support the Constitution and obey the laws of the United States, and 
will, to the best of my ability, encourage others so to do: So help me God"; 
which oath or affirmation may be administered by any registering 
officer.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 2.</STRONG> <I>And be it further enacted</I>, That 
after the completion of the registration hereby provided for in any State, at 
such time and places therein as the commanding general shall appoint and direct, 
of which at least thirty days public notice shall be given, and election shall 
be held of delegates to a convention for the purpose of establishing a 
constitution and civil government for such State loyal to the Union, said 
convention in each State, except Virginia, to consist of the same number of 
members as the most numerous branch of the State legislature of such State in 
the year eighteen hundred and sixty, to be apportioned among the several 
districts, counties, or parishes of such State by the commanding general, giving 
to each representation in the ratio of voters registered as aforesaid as nearly 
as may be. The convention in Virginia shall consist of the same number of 
members as represented the territory now constituting Virginia in the most 
numerous branch of the legislature of said State in the year eighteen hundred 
and sixty, to be apportioned as aforesaid.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 3.</STRONG> 
<I>And be it further enacted</I>, That at said election the registered voters of

written or printed on the ballots by which they vote for delegates, as 
aforesaid, the words "For a convention", and those voting against such a 
convention shall have written or printed on such ballots the words "Against a 
convention". The persons appointed to superintend said election, and to make 
return of the votes given thereat, as herein provided, shall count and make 
return of the votes given for and against a convention; and the commanding 
general to whom the same shall have been returned shall ascertain and declare 
the total vote in each State for and against a convention. If a majority of the 
votes given on that question shall be for a convention, then such convention 
shall be held as hereinafter provided; but if a majority of said votes shall be 
against a convention, then no such convention shall be held under this act: 
Provided, That such convention shall not be held unless a majority of all such 
registered voters shall have voted on the questions of holding such 
convention.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 4.</STRONG> <I>And be it further enacted,</I> 
That the commanding general of each district shall appoint as many boards of 
registration as may be necessary, consisting of three loyal officers or persons, 
to make and complete the registration, superintend the election, and make return 
to him of the votes, list of voters, and of the persons elected as delegates by 
a plurality of the votes cast as said election; and upon receiving said returns 
he shall open the same, ascertain the persons elected as delegates, according to 
the returns of the officers who conducted said election, and make proclamation 
thereof; and if a majority of the votes given on that question shall be for a 
convention, the commanding general, within sixty days from the date of election, 
shall notify the delegates to assemble in convention, at a time and place to be 
mentioned in the notification, and said convention, when organized, shall 
proceed to frame a constitution and civil government according to the provisions 
of this act, and the act to which it is supplementary; and when the same shall 
have been so framed, said constitution shall be submitted by the convention for 
ratification to the persons registered under the provisions of this act at an 
election to be conducted by the officers or persons appointed, or to be 
appointed by the commanding general, as hereinbefore provided, and to be held 
after the expiration of thirty days from the date of notice thereof, to be given 
by said convention; and the returns thereof shall be made to the commanding 
general of the district.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 5.</STRONG> <I>And be it further 
enacted,</I> That if, according to said returns, the constitution shall be 
ratified by a majority of the votes of the registered electors qualified as 
herein specified, cast at said election, at least one-half of all the registered 
voters voting upon the question of such ratification, the president of the 
convention shall transmit a copy of the same, duly certified, to the President 
of the United States, who shall forthwith transmit the same to Congress, if then 
in session, and if not in session, then immediately upon its next assembling; 
and if it shall moreover appear to Congress that the election was one at which 
all the registered and qualified electors in the State had an opportunity to 
vote freely, and without restraint, fear, or the influence of fraud, and if the 
Congress shall be satisfied that such constitution meets the approval of a 
majority of all the qualified electors in the State, and if the said 
constitution shall be declared by Congress to be in conformity with the 
provisions of the act to which this is supplementary, and the other provisions 
of said act shall have been complied with, and the said constitution shall be 
approved by congress, the State shall be declared entitled to representation, 
and senators and representatives shall be admitted therefrom as therein 
provided.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 6. </STRONG><I>And be it further enacted,</I> That 
all elections in the States mentioned in the said "Act to provide for the more 
efficient government of the rebel States", shall, during the operation of said 
act, be by ballot; and all officers making the said registration of voters, and 
conducting said elections, shall, before entering upon the discharge of their 
duties, take and subscribe the oath prescribed by the act approved July second, 
eighteen hundred and sixty-two, entitled "An act to prescribe an oath of 
office"; Provided, That if any person shall knowingly and falsely take and 
subscribe any oath in this act prescribed, such persons so offending, and being 
thereof duly convicted, shall be subject to the pains, penalties, and 
disabilities which by law are provided for the punishment of the crime of wilful 
and corrupt perjury.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 7. </STRONG><I>And be it further 
enacted,</I> That all expenses incurred by the several commanding generals, or 
by virtue of any orders issued, or appointments made by them, under or by virtue 
of this act, shall be paid out of any moneys in the treasury not otherwise 
appropriated.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 8.</STRONG> <I>And be it further enacted,</I> 
That the convention for each State shall prescribe the fees, salary, and 
compensation to be paid to all delegates and other officers and agents herein 
authorized or necessary to carry into effect the purposes of this act, not 
herein otherwise provided for, and shall provide for the levy and collection of 
such taxes on the property in such State as may be necessary to pay the 
same.<BR><BR><STRONG>Sec. 9.</STRONG> <I>And be it further enacted,</I> That the 
word "article" in the sixth section of the act to which this is supplementary, 
shall be construed to mean "section".<BR><BR><BR>SCHUYLER COLFAX<BR>Speaker of
