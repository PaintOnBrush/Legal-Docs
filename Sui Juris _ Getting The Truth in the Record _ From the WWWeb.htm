    Things You Must Understand</A></B></FONT> 
    <P>Did you know there is no such thing as "Constitutional Rights"? The 
    Constitution does not give you any rights. Your Rights are given to you by 
    God, your Birthright, your Inheritance, Sovereign, and cannot be restricted 
    or taken from you. 
    <P>What the Constitution does in the first ten <A 
    href="http://www.barefootsworld.net/consti11.html">Articles of 
    Amendment</A>, known as the <A 
    href="http://www.barefootsworld.net/consti11.html"><B>"BILL OF 
    RIGHTS"</B></A>,&nbsp; is <B>RESTRICT GOVERNMENTS</B>, both Federal and 
    State, from interfering in the <B>Right of Sovereign Natural People</B> to 
    exercise their <B>Inherent Rights</B> freely. 
    <P>Learn what your Sovereign Inherent Rights are and how to exercise these 
    Rights in order to demand them in a courtroom and protect yourself. 
    <P>Increasingly, people find themselves divested of their rights in court, 
    entrapped through ignorance and fear in snares created by <A 
    href="http://www.barefootsworld.net/nockoets1.html">"Our Enemy, the 
    STATE"<A> to create fines, seize private property, children, inheritances 
    and freedom. People are finding that their attorneys, often paid huge sums 
    of money, do not aggressively defend them, but actively work for the system 
    as "officers of the court". 
    <P>Knowing the real nature of the court and what is happening against you is 
    half the battle in preventing the state from abusing you and your family. 
    Learn why you do not want anybody to "represent" you, how you give up your 
    Sovereignty when you allow anyone to represent you. Learn to tell the public 
    servants in black robes that you do not allow them to violate your Rights 
    and abuse you. Learn to tell the court that you do not voluntarily comply 
    with an unconstitutional Statutory Corporate Administrative process and that 
    you are not a "commodity" to "sustain" a "funding resource stream" for the 
    STATE. 
    <P>Learn how to go into a court, exercise your Sovereignty, claim your 
    Inherent Rights and make a Public Record of what has happened to you. 
    <P><B>Sui Juris</B> [At law: Latin - su i u ris : "of one's own right"] 1. 
    One who has all the rights to which a freemen is entitled; one who is not 
    under the power of another, as a slave, a minor, and the like. 2. To make a 
    valid contract, a person must, in general, be sui juris. Every one of full 
    age is presumed to be sui juris. --- Bouviers Law Dictionary 
    <P>Sui Juris is a Process to access the Public Record and force the facts of 
    your abuse to be heard. Learn to write your own motions and court documents, 
    and confront any level of government with which you have come into conflict. 
    Learn to demand your Constitutionally protected Inherent Rights in any legal 
    situation, as well as confront unlawful government policies. Learn how to 
    force public servants into accountability. 
    <P>A book, "Sui Juris," has been written in layman's terms, as simply as 
    possible, reasonable and easily understood. Once you know your Rights the 
    courts cannot deceptively manipulate you anymore. 
    <P>Sui Juris has forms to use, sample legal documents for a format to write 
    your own legal paperwork, and relevant information to paint a clear, full 
    picture of the nature of the fraud being openly conducted around you. Once 
    you see it, you will be outraged ! And they will not be able to exploit you.

    <P><B>Taking over your case, going into court sui juris, learning your 
    rights and the process in the court. Making the record, getting your 
    discovery. These are things <FONT color=red>YOU MUST DO!</FONT></B> </P>
    <P>You must realise that the Court you are standing in is an Admiralty/Law 
    Merchant Court under the Uniform Commercial Code, which recognizes only two 
    classes of entities, "Creditors" and "Debtors.", dealing only in the terms 
    and conditions of "Contractural Obligations." It is not a Constitutional 
    Court of proper jurisdiction to secure the Rights of Sovereign Citizens. 
    <B>YOU MUST ESTABLISH THE PROPER JURISDICTION!</B> </P>
    <P>This article is written to send to those, only days away from a hearing, 
    or often, even the next day... usually being exploited and rendered in the 
    court by their "own" attorneys.</P>
    <P>This information is for everyone in a court no matter what the issue. The 
    corrupted court process is the common theme we all face.</P>
    <P>Sui Juris book was written for this exact reason – to present simply to 
    the Sovereign Citizen the basic concept of what the court is, what their 
    rights are, what the process it, what their options are and how to proceed, 
    and what to do after the courts act against you.</P>
    <P>Everyone needs that information. This article is a primer, a "little" Sui 
    Juris book, laying out the basic information about the process and what they 
    are involved in.</P>
    <P>The first thing people have to realize is that the state courts and 
    agencies are only about money and profit margins, compelling contracts on 
    people and selling the proceeds for a profit and federal bounty.</P>
    <P>The problems you face are systemic, in that they are using administrative 
    courts to take people's children, homes, jobs, assess fines, payments and 
    judgments, countless ways they have set up to destroy families and children. 
    It is a citizen abuse industry, so far unaccountable and protected in the 
    courts while everything is stacked against the citizen.</P>
    <P>That is, <B>if</B> you don't know your rights - <B>and they are counting 
    on it.</B> So, you learn that <B>you</B> are the Sovereign in a 
    constitutional state, <B>you</B> have the rights to be free from attack by 
    the state, and the <B>state</B> has the burden of proof to proceed against 
    you.</P>
    <P>But you will find out that the attorney, or a public defender who is 
    assigned to your case, does not work for you, blocks you from making the 
    record of what has happened to you, and together with the civil services 
    agencies, locks you out completely from your own defense and does not defend 
    you.</P>
    <P>After you, acting on your own behalf sui juris, start getting your 
    discovery you will find evidence of "your own" attorney in collusion with 
    the agencies to make money for everybody - string you out, take the 
    services, take the children, your home, your job, your freedom, and abuse 
    you in the meantime, screwing with you every way they can to emotionally, 
    physically, mentally and financially destroy you.</P>
    <P>A word has been used that demands definition and expansion to define the 
    work that <FONT color=red><B>must be done</B></FONT> prior to trial. 
    <P><B>discovery</B> n. the entire efforts of a party to a lawsuit to obtain 
    information before trial through demands for production of documents, 
    depositions of parties and potential witnesses, written interrogatories 
    (questions and answers written under oath), written requests for admissions 
    of fact, examination of the scene, and the petitions and motions employed to 
    enforce discovery rights. The theory of broad rights of discovery is that 
    all parties will go to trial with as much knowledge as possible and that 
    neither party should be able to keep secrets from the other (except for 
    constitutional protection against self-incrimination). Often much of the 
    fight between the two sides in a suit takes place during the discovery 
    period. 
    <P><B>deposition</B> n. the taking and recording of testimony of a witness 
    under oath before a court reporter, in a place away from the courtroom 
    before trial. A deposition is part of permitted pre-trial discovery 
    (investigation), set up by one of the parties to a lawsuit demanding the 
    sworn testimony of the opposing party (defendant or plaintiff), a witness to 
    an event, or an expert intended to be called at trial by the opposition. If 
    the person requested to testify (deponent) is a party to the lawsuit or 
    someone who works for an involved party, notice of time and place of the 
    deposition can be given to the other side's attorney, but if the witness is 
    an independent third party, a subpoena must be served on him/her if he/she 
    is reluctant to testify. The testimony is taken down by the court reporter, 
    who will prepare a transcript if requested and paid for, which assists in 
    trial preparation and can be used in trial either to contradict (impeach) or 
    refresh the memory of the witness, or be read into the record if the witness 
    is not available. 
    <P><B>interrogatories</B> n. as part of the pre-trial discovery process, 
    either party to a lawsuit may send a set of written questions to the other 
    party. These questions (interrogatories) must be answered in writing under 
    oath or under penalty of perjury within a specified time (such as 30 days). 
    Several states ask basic "form" interrogatories on a printed form, with an 
    allowance for "supplemental" interrogatories specifically relevant to the 
    lawsuit. Normal practice is for the lawyers to prepare the questions and for 
    the answering party to have help from his/her/its attorney in understanding 
    the meaning (sometimes hidden) of the questions and to avoid wording in 
    his/her answers which could be interpreted against the party answering. 
    Objections as to relevancy or clarity may be raised either at the time the 
    interrogatories are answered or when they are used in trial. Most states 
    limit the number of interrogatories that may be asked without the court's 
    permission to keep the questions from being a means of oppression rather 
    than just a source of information. While useful in getting basic 
    information, they are much easier to ask than answer and are often 
    intentionally burdensome. In addition the parties may request depositions 
    (pre-trial questioning in front of a court reporter) or send "requests for 
    admissions" which must be answered in writing. 
    <P><B><FONT size=+1>Remember this:<BR>If it is not in the court record, IT 
    DOESN'T EXIST as far as the court is concerned ... Get it in the 
    record!!</FONT></B> 
    <P><B>You</B> have all the rights, but when there is a representative on 
    your name <B>you</B> are <B>not there</B> and the court acts as though there 
    is no human there with rights, no parents, only slaves and the STATE is 
    operating under the doctrine of <A 
    href="http://www.barefootsworld.net/parensp.html">Parens Patriae – Universal 
    Trustee – Government as Parent</A>. It is insane but that is what it is, 
    literally.</P>
    <P>People must learn the difference between <B>"represented status"</B>, 
    <B>"pro se"</B> and <B>"pro per"</B> or <B>"sui juris"</B> status in the 
    court. The deception is that <B>"pro se"</B> means literally <B>"represent 
    myself"</B> and you do <B>not</B> "represent" yourself - you <B>are</B> 
    yourself. Pro per means "for myself" and <B>Sui Juris</B> literally means 
    <B>"of my own right (with all the rights to which freemen are 
    entitled.)"</B> The difference is between living and being a non-entity. Do 
    not believe anyone in the court who tells you there is no difference in what 
    these terms mean in the court process.</P>
    <P>This website is here to teach people about court process, so they can 
    learn about their rights and go into a courtroom and understand the 
    deceptions that are being operated around them.</P>
    <P>Everyone in court must know that in order to defend, whether it is the 
    first hearing or a years-long case, <B>you must get your facts into the 
    court record,</B> and then file to get your discovery. These are the first 
    two steps to taking authority as the moving party in your case and beginning 
    to defend yourself.</P>
    <P><B>You</B> learn about your rights, and to be able to make good decisions 
    based on what you learn. We tell people all the time: Do <B>not</B> do 
    anything because we say it, or someone else says it, or some attorney or 
    judge says it. <B>You</B> learn and then <B>you</B> make your own best 
    decisions and know what you are doing. If you go into a court and don't 
    understand you have these rights, you are eaten alive instantly by the 
    attorneys and judges, whose game it is - <B>You are the prey and your assets 
    and freedom are the prize.</B></P>
    <P>So, you write your facts out in affidavit form (on the web you can put 
    <B>affidavit</B> or any other terms into a search engine for definition and 
    learn more about these points). And you file a FOIA/Privacy Act/ Discovery 
    paper to everyone who may have information about you relative to the case, 
    and you find out what they are using against you.</P>
    <P>Usually when you start getting your records you find they are filled with 
    lies and hearsay, but now you can use that in court to turn your case 
    around.</P>
    <P>So if you have not been to court yet - at the beginning like so many who 
    find this web page - then you are in the best position to end their schemes 
    real quick by demanding the <B>documents</B> that are supposed to be 
    there.</P>
    <P>They usually do not charge anyone with a crime and they usually have 
    <B>no</B> lawful paperwork, but if you have an attorney he will allow this 
    and not question it, and allow the court to proceed instead of standing 
    against it.</P>
    <P><B>You demand that if no one is charged with a crime there is no case at 
    all and that the case be dismissed immediately</B>. That is the <B>real</B> 
    bottom line in the courtroom and recently some citizens have learned this 
    and are using it and bringing themselves out of the beast's clutches by 
    being strong on this <B>one</B> point... (ed note: At this time you are 
    usually in a lower court but if they proceed, this is where it's best to 
    make the switch to a higher Court, a Court of General Jurisdiction.)</P>
    <P><B>Everything</B> in the Court (ed note: Of General Jurisdiction) has to 
    be based in credible evidence that you did something to another or someone 
    did something to another and there is a crime and charges. Without this, and 
    lawful warrants, they are outside of the law and they know it if you 
    confront it <B>out loud on the record</B>.</P>
    <P>If you are already being processed in a case, then you can write your 
    paper and call it <B>"Affidavit to set aside"</B> or <B>"Affidavit for 
    Review"</B> or <B>"Affidavit objecting to form of order"</B> or 
    <B>"Affidavit to rescind all signatures"</B> or <B>"Affidavit to sever all 
    bar restrictions or claims on your name"</B>, all kinds of other things... 
    the idea being that you get rid of the representative who is on your name 
    and file your own real paperwork sui juris into the court record with real 
    facts.</P>
    <P>You make the claim into the court that they are proceeding against you 
    without having produced all discovery, if that is the case. <B>It usually 
    is.</B> These are outlaw things they are doing to you, but it goes nowhere 
    unless you make the claims in your paperwork and orally on the record <B>out 
    loud</B> when you are <B>in</B> court. The record is the key they would 
    prevent you from using. Once you understand your rights you will make the 
    record in every hearing.</P>
    <P>The tool of process that people need to understand that works in the 
    court is that the most basic court rule is that undisputed testimony becomes 
    <B>fact</B> in the record. In other words, when you make the record of 
    things they are doing to you, and you write it <B>in</B> your papers and 
    <B>say it</B> in the court when you are in court, then they <B>know</B> that 
    they have to dispute your facts or else your facts become the "legal facts" 
    in the case.</P>
    <P>The games they play are all centered on controlling the record. As you 
    make your discovery, the other side of your making the record, you will see 
    the lies they are spinning in fabricated documents and reports to use 
    against you to make money for their agencies and to use against you.</P>
    <P>This is the most basic of court process but <B>you</B> have to do it. It 
    is simple. If you can tell someone what has happened to you and you can 
    write or type a paper, you can proceed in court sui juris.</P>
    <P>We see remarkable things every day by lay people who never imagined a 
    week before that they could go into court and handle their case so capably, 
    and lately have been winning as well. The judges <B>know</B> that you have 
    the absolute right to do the things being outlined here. They can't stand it 
    when people exercise their sovereign authority over public servants, judges 
    and agency officials, by holding them accountable, and by not complying with 
    their outlaw process.</P>
    <P>They create secret files, now they call this <B>"legal file"</B> and 
    <B>"social file"</B>. It's totally outlaw to have any records in the case 
    that are being used that are not disclosed to <B>all</B> parties 
    <B>equally</B>. This is one of the ways they violate your rights the 
    most.</P>
    <P><B>You</B> have to make an issue of it, in your papers and in the 
    courtroom <B>out loud</B> when you are in there. You say how they are hiding 
    records and keeping discovery undisclosed to you, and that it is in 
    violation of your rights and malicious prosecution to do this. <B>You have 
    to say it</B> or it is not there in the record.</P>
    <P>That goes for every issue that needs to be raised - the attorneys are the 
    ones who raise the issues and when you are sui juris you do the things a 
    good attorney <B>would</B> do if there were such a thing. They all work for 
    the <B>BAR</B> association, the judges are all <B>BAR</B> members or 
    structured by statutes to <B>not</B> confront another judge or attorney in a 
    courtroom nor to defend you and to <B>never</B> confront the outlaw process 
    going on. (ed note: <A 
    href="http://www.barefootsworld.net/sui_juris/hiding_behind_bar.html#britbar">BAR 
    acronym</A> for "<A 
    href="http://www.barefootsworld.net/sui_juris/hiding_behind_bar.html#britbar">British 
    Admiralty Registry...</A> with Oath subject to the Queen. Question these 
    links.)</P>
    <P>This information about process has been the most privately held secret of 
    the court agents for all time, and people did not see how to use it or how 
    it was being used against them. For most normal people words like 
    <B>"process"</B> and <B>"discovery"</B> are foreign terms and their use is 
    <B>completely unknown</B>. When you must deal with a court these terms are 
    key to understanding what is happening to you.</P>
    <P>Do not engage with them at all, only for necessary appointments, etc. 
    Learn to say to anyone who tries to talk to you <B>off the record</B> 
    "Anything you have to say to me you have to put in writing to the court and 
    we will respond there." and hang the phone up.</P>
    <P>You do <B>not</B> want to talk to them about <B>any court issue off the 
    record</B> and if you must, then you <B>record</B> your conversation, 
    meeting or if they get nasty and wont let you record, then you go home and 
    write an affidavit of the whole conversation that just took place, date that 
    and file that into the court record and serve it on the parties.</P>
    <P>You stop defending against their accusations and hearsay and learn that 
    real court is about only what is relevant to a criminal charge, and usually 
    there is no criminal charge at all. The people get entangled in all the "he 
    said she said" crap. We say they <B>"throw a wad of crap at the people and 
    see what sticks"</B>, and when people are vulnerable and usually poor, they 
    are helpless to the schemes and exploitation of the agencies robotic <B>"no 
    wrong door"</B> policies and databases. Once they get <B>one</B> encounter 
    with someone and get the info they <B>"reach out"</B> to the whole extended 
    family, assessing everyone, even the neighborhood!</P>
    <P><B>All</B> of this is in the Sui Juris book which also contains examples 
    of format to write your own papers. According to original jurisdiction of 
    First Congress case law, your papers have a standard that "any reasonable 
    people would understand." Facts are the key. Stating your facts that 
    incriminate the agents of the state, and that they can't dispute, is what 
    turns your case around. They do what they do because they can, and because 
    people are only now learning in a public knowledge way of this totally 
    abusive scheme going on in courts.</P>
    <P>So there are only two options dealing with this beast. You decide that 
    you are going to stand against it and fully defend yourself in the court all 
    the way through no matter what they do, or decide that you won't, can't, are 
    not going to and compromise, pay their fees, do the things they order you to 
    do, let them rape you and your children and you sit silently with a 
    representative for the state selling you out, you not standing at all. Those 
    are the two dynamics going on in the process.</P>
    <P>People can only claim their <B>Inherent Rights</B> themselves. These are 
    your God given rights, you eat your own food, you think your own thoughts 
    and you bear your own children. Your children are your blood and offspring 
    in reality, no matter that the judge writes that the state is the parent or 
    adopts the child out fifty times, your children are your flesh and blood, 
    your Family Body is where your Inherent Rights extend. <B>You</B> have to 
    claim them. No attorney or representative can make claims for other people. 
    The attorneys know all this, but the people until recent years did not 
    understand this process clearly to use it and not be ground up in the 
    system's machine.</P>
    <P>We say it a lot: <B>"now we see it, now we stop it"</B>. We restore our 
    constitutional process in the courts ourselves by going into the court and 
    <B>being</B> the solution, bringing to accountability the ones who are 
    violating our rights.</P>
    <P>So <B>learn</B> your rights, and consider this information seriously. 
    People from all over the world are living the same nightmares, identical in 
    process, same no court of remedy and aggression by criminals working for the 
    state, and corrupt courts when you try to bring redress and get your 
    children/home/lives/finances back.</P>
    <P>The way they work their whole world is on judicial orders. You have to 
    overwhelm the false and unseen record they are building with the facts that 
    make the record of your defense. (Ed: One small truth will crush a mountain 
    of lies.)</P>
