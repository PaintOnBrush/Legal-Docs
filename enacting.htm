Clause</FONT></B></P>
<P align=center><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Any bill, rule, regulation, code, or 
other document that purports to be a Law<BR>must contain an "Enacting 
Clause."</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Enacting Clauses are required by the Constitutions 
of 46 of the 50 States, and the Supreme Courts of the other 4 States have all 
ruled that Enacting Clauses are required, even though the Constitution doesn't 
require them.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The Constitution for the United States does not 
require Enacting Clauses, even though the Preamble to the Constitution is the 
Enacting Clause for the Constitution.</FONT></B></P>
<P align=center><IMG border=0 src="enacting_files/divid005.jpg" width=300 
height=5></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Enacting Clauses identify the Individual, or the 
group, that created the Law.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>This information will allow everyone to determine 
their legal or lawful relationship is to the Individual, or group, that is 
created the Law.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>If there is no legal or lawful relationship, then 
the law does not apply.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>If you live in Florida, you are not subject to the 
laws of California unless you happen to be visiting California</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Enacting Clauses also declare the authority the 
Individual, or group, claims in order to create the Law.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>If the Individual, or group, has no authority, or 
right, to create the law, then the law is not really a law and has no effect on 
anyone.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>As an example:<BR>The Janitor in the Senate Office 
Building has no authority to write a law, even though he works in the Senate 
Office Building.</FONT></B></P>

<P align=center><FONT size=3 face="PosterBodoni BT">Enacting Clauses have been 
used throughout history</FONT></P>
<P align=center><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The Ten Commandments has an Enacting 
Clause:</FONT></B></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=2 face=Arial><B>The Clause states:<FONT 
color=green>"I am the Lord thy God"</FONT></B></FONT></P>
<P align=center><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The Individual is the 
"Lord"</FONT></B></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=2 face=Arial><B>His authority is that He is our 
God</B></FONT></P>
<P align=center><IMG border=0 src="enacting_files/divid005.jpg" width=300

<P align=center><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The edict of Cyrus to allow the Jews 
to rebuild Jerusalem has an Enacting Clause:</FONT></B></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=2 face=Arial><B>The Clause states:<FONT 
color=green>"Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia"</FONT></B></FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=2 face=Arial><B>The Individual is 
"Cyrus"</B></FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=2 face=Arial><B>His authority is that He is the 
King</B></FONT></P>
<P align=center><IMG border=0 src="enacting_files/divid005.jpg" width=300 
height=5></P>
<P align=center><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>The Constitution for the united 
States or America has an Enacting Clause:</FONT></B></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=2 face=Arial><B>The Clause, which is in the Preamble 
to the Constitution, states:<FONT color=green>"We the 
People"</FONT></B></FONT></P>
<P align=center><B><FONT color=black size=2 face=Arial>The goup is 
"We"</FONT></B></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=2 face=Arial><B>Our authority is that we are the

<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Almost all constitutions prescribe the mode and 
process of making laws.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Generally, these include: </FONT></B></P>
<UL>
  <LI><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Giving the bill a Title that is reflective of 
  the purpose set forth in the bill</FONT></B> 
  <LI><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Placing the Enacting Clause between the Title 
  and the Body of the Bill</FONT></B> 
  <LI><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Reading the FULL bill on each of three 
  different days in each Legislative House, including the Title and the Enacting 
  Clause</FONT></B> 
  <LI><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>If Passed, the bill must be signed by the 
  Speaker of the House of Representatives and by the President of the 
  Senate</FONT></B> 
  <LI><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The votes must be recorded in the Journal for 
  the specific House</FONT></B> 
  <LI><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The bill must be signed by the governor of the 
  State, or the president of the United States, as the case may be</FONT></B> 
  <LI><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The completed bill must be recorded in the 
  office of the Secretary of State</FONT></B> 
  <LI><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The completed bill must be announced, by 
  publication, by the Secretary of State</FONT></B> 
  <LI><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>And, it is extremely important that every 
  publication of the Law must contain the Title, the Enacting Clause, and the 
  full Body of the Law.</FONT></B> 
  <LI><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>If the publication does not contain everything, 
  then there is no evidence on the face of the Law to prove that it was lawfully 
  established, who created the Law, and what authority they claim to be entitled 
  to create the Law.</FONT></B></LI></UL>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>If the publication does not contain these items, 
then the Law has not been properly published, as required,<BR>therefore, the Law 
is null and void and has no effect on anyone.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT><FONT color=green size=2 face=Arial>Written 
Laws, in all times and all countries, whether the edicts of absolute monarchs, 
decrees of Kings and Councils, or the enactments of representative bodies, have 
almost invariably, in some form, expressed upon their face the authority by 
which they were promulgated or enacted. The almost unbroken custom of centuries 
has been to preface laws with a statement declaring the enacting authority. -

<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The completed bill 
may also be subject to other procedures as are validly prescribed in the 
Constitution, or in the bill itself</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Then, and only then, can the bill be called a 
Law</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Then, and only then, can the Law be 
enforced</FONT></B></P>

<P align=center><FONT size=3 face="PosterBodoni BT">But, there is still a very 
basic decision that must be addressed</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT size=3 face=Arial><B></B></FONT><FONT size=2 
face=Arial><B>Who is subject to the Law?</B></FONT></P>
<P align=center><IMG border=0 src="enacting_files/divid005.jpg" width=300 
height=5></P>
<P><FONT size=2 face=Arial><B>Only those individuals who have a legal, or 
lawful, relationship to the Law makers are subject to any Law they 
create.</B></FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>A Citizen of France is not subject to the Laws of 
the United States, or of China, or of any other country around the world, unless 
he, or she, is living, or traveling in that country.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>A Citizen of the State of New York is not subject 
to the Laws of Utah, or of California, or of any other State, unless he, or she, 
is living, or traveling in that State.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>An individual living in a community is not subject 
to the Laws of the neighboring community, or of any other community, unless he, 
or she, is living, or traveling in that community.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Unless there is a legal, or lawful, relationship 
to the Law makers, Individuals are not subject to the Laws created by such law 
makers</FONT></B></P>
<P align=center><B><FONT size=4 face=Arial>That's why an Enacting Clause is 
required on any Law for it to be effective.</FONT></B></P>
