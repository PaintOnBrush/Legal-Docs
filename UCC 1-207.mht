    <P>This is a slightly condensed, casually paraphrased transcript of =
tapes of=20
    a seminar given in 1990 by Howard Freeman. We prepared it in order =
to make=20
    available the knowledge and experience of Mr. Freeman in his search =
for an=20
    accessible and understandable explanation of the confusing state of =
the=20
    government and the courts. It should be helpful to those who may =
have=20
    difficulty learning from lectures. Also it should help those who =
want to=20
    develop a deeper understanding of the information, without having to =
listen=20
    to three or four hours of recorded material.</P>
    <P>The frustration many feel about our judicial system can be =
overwhelming=20
    and frightening and cause fear based on a lack of understanding and=20
    knowledge. Those of us who have chosen a path out of bondage and =
into=20
    liberty face, eventually, the seemingly tyrannical power of a =
governmental=20
    agency and the mystifying awesome power of the courts. We learned =
that we=20
    must "get a good lawyer", that is becoming harder to find, if =
impossible.=20
    When defending ourselves from government, we find that the lawyers =
quickly=20
    take our money and then tell us, as the ship is sinking, "I can't =
help you=20
    with that - <B><I>I'm an officer of the court</I></B>."</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the only way for us to have a "snowball's chance" is =
to=20
    understand the rules of the "game" and to come to an understanding =
of the=20
    true nature of the Law. The lawyers have established and secured a =
virtual=20
    monopoly over this sphere of knowledge by implying that the subject =
is just=20
    too difficult for the average person to understand, and by creating =
a=20
    separate vocabulary out of English words of otherwise common usage. =
While it=20
    may, at times, seem hopelessly complicated, it is not that difficult =
to.=20
    grasp. Are lawyers really as smart as they would have us believe? =
Besides,=20
    anyone who has been through a legal battle against the government =
with the=20
    aid of a lawyer has come to realize that lawyers know =
<B><I>procedure, not=20
    law</I></B>.</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, =
master,=20
      thus saying thou reproachest us also. And he said, woe unto you =
also, ye=20
      lawyers! For ye made men with burdens grievous to be born, and ye=20
      yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers... Woe =
unto you,=20
      lawyers! For ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye entered =
not in=20
      yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.
      <P align=3Dright>(Luke 11:45-52)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Mr. Freeman admits that he is not a lawyer and as such, he has a =
way of=20
    explaining law to us that puts it well within our reach. Consider =
also that=20
    the framers of the Constitution wrote in language simple enough for =
the=20
    people to understand, specifically so that it would not have to be=20
    interpreted.</P>
    <P>So again we find, as in many other ways, the "buck stops here!" =
It is=20
    <B><I>we</I></B> who must take the responsibility for finding and =
putting to=20
    good use the TRUTH. It is <B><I>we</I></B> who must claim and defend =
our...=20
    [Creator]-given rights and freedom from those who would take them =
from us.=20
    It is <B><I>we</I></B> who must protect ourselves, our families and =
our=20
    posterity from intrusion by those who live parasitically from the =
labor,=20
    skill and talents of others.</P>
    <P>To these ends, Mr. Freeman offers a simple. hopeful explanation =
of our=20
    plight and a <B><I>peaceful method</I></B> of dealing with it. =
Please take=20
    note that this lecture represents one chapter in his book, which he=20
    continues to refine, expand, and improve. It is, as all bits of =
wisdom are,=20
    a point of departure from which to begin our own journey of =
discovery, so=20
    that we all might pass on to others greater knowledge and hope, and =
to...=20
    [the Creator] the gift of lives lived in peace, freedom and =
praise.</P>

    <P><FONT size=3D+2>Chapter 6: Without Prejudice UCC =
1-207</FONT></CENTER>
    <P>Black's. Without prejudice. Where an offer or admission is made =
"without=20
    prejudice," or a motion is denied or a suit dismissed "without =
prejudice,"=20
    it is meant as a declaration that no rights or privileges of the =
party=20
    concerned are to be considered as thereby waived or lost accept in =
so far as=20
    may be expressly conceded or decided.
    <P>A signing of "without prejudice" entitles the Sovereign Citizen =
to Thee=20
    Bill of Rights, which attach to his person or "personam" and those =
rights=20
    are not waived unless through actions on the part of the sovereign =
at a=20
    future date or a court decision in advance of your reservation. Your =

    political knowledge must defend your contracting needs and all =
controversies=20
    must be settled with written correspondence. You=92re right to avoid =

    consequences of statute or commercially assigned obligations put the =
burden=20
    on plaintiff to prove his statements with verified or sworn =
instruments.
    <P>Agency police power is voided upon notice of the "personam" =
Citizen.=20
    "Probable cause" rather than civil statute of "reasonable cause" is=20
    required. "Artificial" "persons" who obligate to the subject matter=20
    instrument are "made liable" to its delict. An "unconditional" =
signing gives=20
    the agency court in personam and subject matter jurisdiction per =
Rule 12(b).=20
    Without prejudice reserves your personam and takes away the =
"inferior" court=20
    requirement, of having both subject matter and in personam =
jurisdiction. The=20
    Article I court cannot judge an action until it clears the =
administrative=20
    level and has acquired both jurisdictions. Article III Judicial must =
try=20
    sovereign citizens by design, after criminal intent has been =
alleged.
    <P>Uniform Commercial Code 1-207. "Performance or Acceptance Under=20
    Reservation of Rights. (1) A party who with explicit reservation of =
rights=20
    performs or promises performance or assents to performance in a =
manner=20
    demanded or offered by the other party does not thereby prejudice =
the rights=20
    reserved. Such words as "without prejudice," "under protest" or the =
like are=20
    sufficient."
    <P>A reservation of Thee Bill of Rights is a demand and notice, =
which gives=20
    We Thee People our proper status as state citizens and a court of =
Article=20
    III Law.
    <P>Amendment VII: "In Suits at common Law, where the controversy =
shall=20
    exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be =
preserved, and no=20
    fact tried by jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of =
the=20
    united States, than according to the rules of the common law."
    <P>A sovereign Citizen cannot be tried in a statutory inferior court =
without=20
    his consent and your contracting without a reservation of rights =
ensures=20
    disaster of political status. The use of the UCC is for those =
contracts,=20
    which are commercially forced upon the Sovereign Citizen and are =
essential=20
    for proper remedy at Law. The W-4, drivers license, bank, school and =
agency=20
    protective services are the presumptive contractual systems and =
these are=20
    "engraft" of "Penumbra Doctrine" and the "implied powers" of Article =
I and=20
    Article II, which "makes" Admiralty, and puts you before the =
"inferior"=20
    courts with the burden of proving innocence. Penalties of perjury =
are of=20
    criminal intent and must be protected or the adversity of the issue =
will=20
    apply via your waiver.
    <P>Black's. An accord being a contract, the requirements of mutual =
assent=20
    and consideration must be met. Buob v. Feenaughty Machinery Co., 191 =
Wash.=20
    477, 71 P.2d 559, 564.
    <P>A contract signed under duress is unconscionable and must be =
represented=20
    "without prejudice" or the instrument is treated as "satisfaction =
and=20
    accord" before the trier of fact.
    <P>Black's. Unconcionability. Unconcionability is generally =
recognized to=20
    include an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the =
parties,=20
    to a contract together with contract terms, which are unreasonably =
favorable=20
    to the other party. Gordon v. Crown Central Petroleum Corp., =
D.C.Ga., 423=20
    F.Supp. 58, 61.
    <P>Procedural advantages are granted to the executor, which allows =
facts=20
    agreed upon to be carried out, even police power of court. The only =
reason I=20
    signed a W-4 was to engrave without prejudice upon it. My job =
requires the=20
    W-4 form and the reservation brings peace to the issue of being =
exempt.=20
    Without the reservation, I would have been assessed a $500 frivolous =

    penalty. My employer and the IRS are contracted entities and I do =
not wish=20
    to participate or "benefit" with them.
    <P>Remember, the perjury portion is a statute criminal matter. Once =
into the=20
    body of the contract, all corporate rights are protected and =
wiggling the=20
    facts are forbidden. The 5th Amendment cannot protect your waived =
rights,=20
    for court decisions advise the reservation must be made upon the =
instrument=20
    as a clear indicator of your intention. Your voluntary act of =
signature=20
    without your representation is your cause of worry. Since there is =
no place=20
    in the 1040 to put a claim for defense, the Citizen must write their =

    objections upon the "unit" or prima facie. The "Privacy Act" states =
that=20
    when a person is "made liable;" they are required to send a "return =
or tax=20
    statement." A reservation of rights breaks this "made liable" into=20
    Constitutional issues that the IRS cannot deal with.
    <P>Black's. Uniform Commercial Code. (1) If the court as a matter of =
law=20
    finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been =
unconscionable=20
    at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the =
contract, or may=20
    enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable =
clause or=20
    it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to =
avoid any=20
    unconscionable result. (2) When it is claimed or appears to the =
court that=20
    the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties =
shall=20
    be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its=20
    commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making =
the=20
    determination.
