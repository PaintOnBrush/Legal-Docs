Dear Mr. White , I am writing you regarding the notices I sent you seeking clarification in respect to the following parking tickets, Hickory street, ticket number 132300148 , Park Ave, ticket number 177763B and Salina Street S, ticket number 132702299.I acknowledged the receipt of said summons in the proper fashion not dishonoring these notices of claims for owed monies for whitch I requested clarification, NOT creating "DISPUTE" nor " CONFLICT" in dishonor, but offering conditional acceptance upon verification of your claim, I requested a signed LAWFUL two party contract that makes me liable ,along with a SIGNED ORIGINAL BILLS.I am not bound to the terms and condtions of ANY contract , nor am I signatory to any agreement whitch gives the related statutes the force of law, nor did I ever plea or agree or consent to such. A contract cannot be IMPOSED where one does not exist. The notices failed to provide any evidence of complaing party alleging UNDER OATH and PENALTY OF PERJURY the violation of lawful right or damage or injury to their person or property.As such there was no valid cause of action, no standing, no corpus delicti and thus no jursidiction authority given to any court by transference of allegations sworn under oath and additionally no " TRUE BILL ". If there is no complaining party alleging under oath these two elements of corpus delicti the third element, redress ability of the court, also does not exist. Only a grand jury can issue a true bill for a vailid summons.I honored summons and did not make conflict and simply sought presenment of the above following documentations, for whitch I only received notice of ," DENIED " then stating I did not make a presentment for whitch under oath signed, notarized and sent registered mail I clearly did make as evidence will show . My Notices for conditional acceptance therefor puts you in default Judgement. It was assumed as my notice clearly stated that failure to provide such signed two party contract and signed original bill along with under oath complaining party that ANY AND ALL points not in contention will be contrued as and mutually understood by shared understanding by acquiescence, which would create permanent irrevocable estoppel with all respect to all matters not in contention. All responses were to be signed under oath, bond and full commericial liability to be VALID.They where not Mr. White .Mr. White such notices were indeed sent to you,signed under oath, notarized and registered mail as evidence will show , yet my car was then seized by the city .It is my understanding that you are the supervisor and in charge of such matters, is this true ?
Mr. White, I hereby give notice of liability and intent to file suit in Common law court for subsequent damages I incurred as a result of my car being booted and seized by city with out a Lawful grand jury Indictment to lawfully do so. 

On this day of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ Sept 5,2013 ,Sincerly Kelly Hitchcock
