        <h2>The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)        </h2>
        <p>The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act is the main law for consumers and companies  as it relates to the credit reporting system we have here in the United States. It not only protects consumers by specifying their rights, it also lists the responsibilities of companies who collect the credit information, distribute the credit reports, and use the information.</p>
        <p>In general the Fair Credit Reporting Act covers more than just credit reporting companies such as credit bureaus. It now defines and covers all consumer reporting agencies that gather, retain, compile, issue, and use credit reports, insurance reports, employee background reports, tenant screening, bank bad check and overdraft reports, and other consumer reports based on consumer reporting information such as consumer credit experiences, court records, and other personal consumer information. </p>
