      rights under statute allowing defendant charged with misdemeanor to waive 
      trial before district judge and to elect trial before magistrate judge, 
      where the relevant portion of the consent form was three sentences long, 
      and only one of the sentences addressed defendant's right to an Article 
      III judge." U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3, sec. 1 etseq; 18 U.S.C.A. sec 3401(b);

      <P align="left">"In its most fundamental or strict sense, 'jurisdiction' 
      means an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case, an absence 
      of authority over the subject matter or the parties, but the term may also 
      refer to the situation where a court that has jurisdiction over the 
      subject matter has no power to act except in a particular manner, or to 
      give certain kinds of relief, or to act without the occurrence of certain 
      procedural prerequisites; action 'in excess of jurisdiction' by a court 
      that has jurisdiction in a fundamental sense is not void, but only 
      voidable." People v. Burnett, 83 Cal.Rptr.2d 629, 71 Cal.App 151

      failed to appear in court to be arraigned on accusatory instrument." -Id
      <BR>&nbsp;</P>

      <P align="left">"A court cannot acquire jurisdiction to try a person for 
      an act made criminal only by an unconstitutional law, and thus, an offense 
      created by an unconstitutional statute, is no longer a crime and a 
      conviction under such statute cannot be a legal cause for imprisonment."

      <P align="left">"Jurisdiction is determined solely from face of

      <P align="left">"As a prerequisite for presiding over a case , a court 
      must have jurisdiction over the subject matter of an offense and of the

      <P align="left">"Before a court may exercise judicial power to hear and

      <P align="left">"There was no merit to defendant's contention that
