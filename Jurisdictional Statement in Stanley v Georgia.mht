Section=20
26-6301 and it was that section as reenacted in 1956 which was held to =

unconstitutional in Simpson v. State supra. The fact that the 1963 Act=20

Sec. 26-6301 and further provided that the Chapter, should be amended by =

Whether a person has knowledge of a fact is a matter peculiarly within =
the mind=20
