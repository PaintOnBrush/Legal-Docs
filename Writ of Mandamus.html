<p>The WRIT OF MANDAMUS  stems from English Law, coming from British court system. It is a highly prerogative writ  issued by the High Court of Justice. It is from a Latin word meaning  root – writ. In English Law, it  contained a special command  or law (in the king’s name), directed towards the inferior courts,corporations or individuals. It orders them to carry out a particular act in the duty of the office which they’re bound by law to do. It has a legal right to be enforced. The direct orders coming from the sovereign to the subjects that commands doing specific actions were ordinary in those times. The mandamus originally pertained to this particular class of orders. It  was common culture for the court of the King&#8217;s bench (where a lawful duty existed without any practical means to enforce that), to readily order a desired performance by the writ. Mandamus, is actually a special discretionary remedy. It is the application which is made in good faith. The petitioner has to convince the Court that he has the legal right to  abide by legal duties as distinct from the sheer discretion of the concerned authority.  This would be the right to satisfy if it is fair and legal.  The mandamus is generally issued as an authority by pressure of the law to carry out a certain duty, in spite of the written demand not being carried out. The writ of mandamus happens when it is essential to nullify an illegal order.</p>

<p>There are basically 3 types of mandamus. The first one is an alternative mandamus. It is a particular type of mandamus that&#8217;s issued on the initial application for release. It  orders a defendant to either carry out the action needed or just to come before the court to show reasons for performing it in the first place. The second category is the peremptory mandamus. It is a rather absolute as well as unqualified command put on the defendant for compelling the accomplishment of an act in question. It’s generally issued as the defendant starts to default on, or somehow fails to exhibit acceptable reasons to answer the alternative mandamus. The third one is the continuing mandamus. This is a special category of mandamus that had been originally issued to the lower authorities in favor of general public interests. It requests the officials  to smoothly carry out the lawful tasks expeditiously.  It must be sustained for an unspecified period to prevent the miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>Under the legal system of Australia, mandamus remains widely and easily available through the section 75(v) in the Australian Constitution. In England and Wales, mandamus was at first known as the &#8216;writ of mandamus.&#8217; More recently, it is known as the &#8216;order of mandamus.In the United States, the legal system, requires the Writ of Mandamus be enforceable judicially. It has to be a legally protected right before one suffering an injustice or grievance can petition the court for a Writ of Mandamus. A person suffering a grievance is considered to have suffered a grievance when denied a legal right by someone (usually someone in authority) who has a legal obligation to act or refrain from acting on an issue.</p>
<p>In The United States, a Writ of Mandamus has to be judicially enforceable. It is a legally protected right of someone suffering an injustice to ask for the mandamus. A person is considered to have a grievance when he is denies a legal right by someone (usually in authority) who has a legal obligation to act or refrain from doing something. It is essentially a judicial remedy for a defect in the judicial system.</p>
<p>As with any legal issue or concern, contacting a good law firm or attorney is wise to get the advise you need for your particular circumstance. Getting several opinions is always a good idea. Get your questions answered. trust but verify.</p>
