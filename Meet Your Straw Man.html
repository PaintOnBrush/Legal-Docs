<b>Meet Your Straw Man</b> <br>
by Moses G. Washington <br>
revised on 10/27/03 <br><br>

<font color=#00CC33>Disclaimer <br><br>

The material in this essay is for educational purposes <u><b>only</b></u> and not to be construed as legal 
advice about what you should or should not do. The information herein is to assist you in 
performing your own due diligence before implementing any strategy. Formal notice is hereby 
given that: <br><br>

(TSUF) in writing of any word, phrase, reference or statement which is inaccurate, incorrect, 
misleading or not in full compliance with state and federal law and to give TSUF 30 days to

law. <br><br></font>

As a child, you have had an imaginary friend. You may be surprised to learn that evidence exists 
that you have had a make-believe twin from the time your mother and father permitted a Birth 
Certificate to be filed for you. This make-believe friend is not real, but artificial. It is a straw 
man, an artificial entity that has a name very similar to yours. Here is a definition of straw man:<br><br>

<ul>
<font color=#3300FF> "A 'front'; a third party who is put up in name only to take part in a transaction. Nominal party to a 
transaction ..." [Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition]<br><br>
</ul>

<ul>
"The term is also used in commercial and property contexts when a transfer is made to a party, 
the straw man, simply for the purpose of retransferring to the transferor in order to accomplish 
some purpose not otherwise permitted." [Barron's, 3rd Edition]<br><br></font>
</ul>

So, in layman's terms, what is a straw man? The straw man is an artificial person. The straw man 
was created by law shortly after you were born via the registration of the application for your 
birth certificate. The name for the straw man is your name in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. You 
will notice that the inscription on the birth certificate is your name in all-capital letters. The 
English language has precise rules of grammar that make no provision for writing proper nouns 
in all-capital letters. So, your name spelled with all-capital letters is a fictitious name. Your straw 
man has a same-sounding name as your name, but is an artificial entity which exists only "by 
force of or in contemplation of law." The all-caps name is not your "true name" which consists 
of the given (Christian) name plus the surname (family name), and appears with only initial 
letters capitalized. The all-caps version of your name is a TRADE NAME, the name under which 
you "do business."<br><br> 

We may also say that the straw man is a "person" according to the legal dictionary. <br><br>

<ul>
 <font color=#3300FF>"Person. 1. a human being. 2. An entity (such as a corporation) that is recognized by law as having the rights and duties of a human being…" [Blacks Law Dictionary, 7th Edition] <br><br>
</ul></font>

The straw man may also be said to be an "artificial person" which is also defined in the legal 
dictionary. <br><br>

<ul>
<font color=#3300FF> "An entity, such as a corporation, created by law and given certain legal rights and duties of a human being; a being, real or imaginary, who for the purpose of legal reasoning is treated more or less as a human being. – Also termed fictitious person; juristic person; legal person; moral person." [Blacks Law Dictionary, 7th Edition]<br><br></font>
</ul>

A straw man may also be thought of as a "legal fiction."<br><br> 

<ul>
<font color=#3300FF> "Legal fiction. Assumption of fact made by court as basis for deciding a legal question. A situation contrived by the law to permit a court to dispose of a matter …" [Black’s Law Dictionary 5th Edition] <br><br></font>
</ul>

As we explore further, we must distinguish between the straw man (an it or person), and the real, 
flesh and blood being (human being) which we will call a "man." "Man" has a legal definition.<br><br> 

<ul>
<font color=#3300FF>"A human being. A person of the male sex. A male of the human species above the age of puberty. In the most extended sense the term includes not only the adult male sex of the human 
species, but women and children. … In feudal law, a vassal; a tenant or feudatory." [Blacks Law 
Dictionary, 5th Edition]<br><br></font>
</ul> 

So we conclude that "man" is a term of nature. But who created nature? Some would say God, 
others would say the Creator (a term often used by the founder of our country), while others 
might hold a different view. On the other hand, we see "person" as a term of the civil law. Who 
is the creator of civil law? <br><br>

<ul>
<font color=#3300FF>"Civil law … a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power of a state … the civil or municipal law of the Roman empire." [Ballentine’s Law Dictionary, 3rd Edition] <br><br></font>
</ul>

So kings, emperors or legislative bodies acting in a sovereign capacity are the "creators" of civil 
law. When our government acts as a sovereign, it is acting outside it's constitutional authority.<br><br> 

So we see that a man and a person are very different terms identifying very different things. If 
you study Roman civil law, you will see that it originates and uses fictions of law – that is, 
concepts that are contrary to the natural order of things, and based upon presumptions that are 
untrue. You will realize that this person recognized in the civil law is a fictional entity. You will 
come to see the vast difference between man and person. So the straw man is a person, a public 
name that is recognized in a civil society. <br><br>

We've mentioned "legal fiction" and "fiction of law", so let's see how these are defined.<br><br> 

<ul>
<font color=#3300FF>"Fiction of law. An assumption or supposition of law that something which is or may be false is 
true, or that a state of facts exists which has never really taken place. An assumption, for 
purposes of justice, of a fact that does not or may not exist. A rule of law which assumes as true, 
and will not allow to be disproved, something which is false, but not impossible." [Black’s Law 
Dictionary 5th Edition]<br><br></font>
</ul> 

This distinction between a man and a person is a difficult concept to grasp. But a proper 
understanding of the relationship between the government, the man and the straw man is 
essential to gaining increased freedom. While the concept of these relationships is very simple, 
there are some foundational principles that must be explored.<br><br> 

We have mentioned that the straw man is an artificial entity or person. But there are several types 
of organizations or artificial entities. There are corporation soles, aggregate corporations, 
municipal corporations, revocable living trusts (sole), and unincorporated business organizations. 
Many people use these entities for various reasons including maintaining personal control over 
their assets; protection from lawsuits and judgments; avoidance of probate; avoidance of estate 
taxes; reduction in tax liability; and many other reasons. We will look into the difference 
between a sole entity and an aggregate entity; the construction of these entities and the results of 
that construction as it apply to the straw man. <br><br>

In all organizations there are two basic operational positions: 1) the stock 
holder/owner/beneficiary (we will call this the beneficiary position); and 2) The 
officer/president/chairman/trustee (we will call this the operational position). A sole corporation, 
as defined by Black’s Law Dictionary, is one consisting of one person only and his successors in 
some particular station, who are incorporated by law in order to give them some legal capacities 
and advantages, particularly that of perpetuity, which in their natural state as persons they could 
not have. In a corporation sole, one person holds both operational positions of the organization. 
A corporation sole may be established under legislative authority. It is considered by statute a 
citizen of the government. As such, the safe guards of the bill of rights do not extend to corporate 
soles. The courts have warned that statutory licensed sole proprietorships are in a fact a 
government agency by definition of how they are created. Most people who chose a sole 
organization do so because they maintain personal control over their assets.<br><br> 

An aggregate corporation such as corporations or business trusts, according to Black's Law 
Dictionary, is composed of a number of individuals vested with corporate powers. With an 
aggregate organization, different parties must hold the beneficiary and operational positions. If 
the same party holds them, they are a sole organization. Family members are always counted as 
one party, therefore would be a sole organization. In an aggregate organization, the one who is in 
control is immune from damages or liabilities of the beneficiaries. In an aggregate corporation, 
the holder of the first operative position controls the assets for the holder of the second operative 
position. The control of the assets has been turned over to someone else's control.<br><br> 

The founder of the wealthy Rockefeller family said one his secrets to wealth was to "own 
nothing, but control everything". In other words, always function from an aggregate relationship. 
Do not own the straw man; control the straw man. If you are not the beneficiary/owner of the 
straw man you are not liable for his debts or obligations. If you are in control, you have the 
highest lien hold interest on the straw man; you must be paid before anyone else collects from 
the straw man, and you cannot go to jail for his misdoing. A look at the structure of the straw 
man entity shows the ownership/control relationship, and which position it is best to hold. Prior 
to the redemption process [redemption is a term used among freedom loving people to describe 
the process of regaining control of your straw man], the man is considered both a beneficiary in 
the relationship and surety for the straw man. After redemption, the man is no longer a 
beneficiary, and is no longer surety. After redemption, the man is the controller and creditor with 
the highest lien hold interest in the straw man. The man is now in an aggregate relationship with 
the straw man. He does not own the straw man but he controls the straw man by the primary lien 
hold interest. <br><br>

In this country, the power was granted to government by the people. Power is granted to the 
government by the people individually - to create States, and by the people as a whole to create 
the National government. Once the people decided individually to create States, they can only 
change the policy or law of the State as people collectively. That is because they have agreed to 
become part of the public. They are one person in a larger body of people that act collectively. 
The people are in the State and National government at that same time. The public government is 
an artificial entity. The government is owned and controlled by the same people. So the 
government is a sole organization, not an aggregate organization. As long as a man is dealing 
publicly, he is in a sole relationship with the public. <b>The straw man, being artificial, lives in 
the artificial place called the public.</b> At the same time as people are acting collectively in the 
larger body of people called the State and National government, they maintain their ability to act 
individually on a private basis. The people did not give up the rights they did not delegate to the 
government - they retained those rights. Any man can contract privately as they see fit and 
government cannot interfere with the private contracts of men. <u><b>The straw man lives in the public 
side of government. He is part of the public government, and functions under the laws of the 
public.</b></u> This is necessary and proper because the creator of an entity has the right to control it. [Personal edit from site owner: The Straw Man could not have come into existence without your parent's signature and your continuance of use of it. Therefore it does not belong solely to the government and you could make a claim to it as the government never would.] 
Since the government created the straw man, it is only right that the straw man live under the 
rules of it's creator. <b>But once the straw man has been redeemed, the government is no longer in 
control of the straw man. He is now controlled by the man using his right to private contracts.</b> 
<b>The man has left the public as a beneficiary in sole relationship to the straw man to live 
privately as creditor in an aggregate relationship with the straw man.</b> As far as this 
relationship is concerned, the straw man is privately controlled. The straw man still exists as a 
public entity because that is the only world in which he has reality. His relationship with the man 
is private. <u>The relationship with the man being is controlling because the man has a higher 
priority lien on the straw man than the government.</u> <br><br>

Now that we understand who the straw man is, it is appropriate to ask who benefits from the 
creation of the straw man? We will see that the straw man benefits the creator (the government), 
any company that uses it and you.<br><br> 

The government began to benefit from the straw man in 1933. In the Article on the U.S. 
Bankruptcy, we've already seen evidence that the United States went bankrupt in 1933. When 
this happened, the governors of all the states met to discuss what should be done. The state 
governors made a "pledge" to the federal government, to fund the bankruptcy. They pledged the 
assets and the energy of the people belonging to the state governments. They would back the 
"government" and secure the national debt. But there was one problem: The states could only 
speak for the people in their public capacity. They could not pledge private, living human beings 
or property. So it was necessary to create a "bridge" between the living people and the creditors 
for the bankruptcy. The answer was to create straw men to stand in the place of the people. Now 
the only problem was devising a scheme whereby the people would agree to contract with the 
straw man as its surety.<br><br> 

When the governors made the pledge, they agreed to register the application form for the birth 
certificates of the people with the U.S. Department of Commerce. The application form for the 
birth certificate is the security instrument (collateral) used to back the pledge. The straw man, the 
legal fiction was created by using the name on the birth certificate and writing it in all capital 
letters, the designation for a legal fiction. Then, because of the "pledge", the people were 
determined to be the representative and surety for the legal fiction. This is how they made us 
responsible to pay back the debt of the United States.<br><br> 

When the "government" or any corporation uses any process whatsoever, they are using it 
against the legal fiction, which they want the people to think is them. But when a name is written 
in all capital letters, IT IS NOT the name of a real person! It is the designation of a legal fiction - 
that is an entirely separate entity. A living human cannot be a legal fiction, and a legal fiction 
cannot be a living human. One is real or natural, the other is created by "law." Because the entire 
thing is based on paying the bankruptcy, the straw man is the debtor and the "government" is 
agent for the creditor, the international bankers who own the Federal Reserve.<br><br> 

Whenever a government agency (such as a court) determines liability, it is a liability of the legal 
straw man since everything is done in commerce. The people are presumed, as evidenced by the 
pledge of their governors, to be the surety for the straw man and they must pay the liability.<br><br> 

Now let's see how the straw man benefits others. Our straw man though of as a "transmitting 
utility" which we define as “an agent solely utilized for the purpose of transmitting commercial 
activity for the benefit of the Secured Party”. Government and big business have set up a system 
so that the only way a man can access the goods and services of the nation is through the straw 
man. The straw man serves as a utility through which goods and services may be transmitted to 
you. You are forced to interface with society through your straw man.<br><br> 

You will notice that the straw man's name is used on virtually all public documents, including 
but not limited to: birth certificate, driver’s license, passport, Social Security card, bank account 
(checks and statements), credit cards, the checks you receive from your employer, legal 
documents, any letter from the government entity at any level, etc. You will discover that 
government agencies, banks and other corporations, courts and tax agencies deal with you 
exclusively through the straw man. These organizations insist on dealing with you only via an 
all-caps version of your name in any and all key documents, contracts, accounts, and agreements 
with them. <br><br>

One of the many "benefits" and services made available through your straw man is your Social 
Security Number (SSN). The SSN is a "public" number associated with a "public persona," your 
straw man. The SSN is a benefit because it allows you to open a bank account or to get a job. A 
federal law was passed in 1994 that made it a requirement to give your SSN to get a driver's 
license. It would be difficult (though not impossible) to do any of these things without using the 
SSN. All of these things, and many more, can be thought of as "benefits" granted to the straw 
man. <br><br>

But these benefits come with a price. It should be obvious that the straw man has not body, and 
that you benefit from the consumption/use of the goods and services made available through the 
straw man. At this point, you probably do not hold title to your straw man (the redemption 
process can correct this problem). Since these things are true, it is also true that you are the one 
responsible for discharging the public liabilities associated with the "benefits" that you enjoy 
courtesy of your straw man. These public liabilities include but are not limited to income tax, 
social security tax, plus any and all debts that the straw man incurs. <br><br>

For further evidence that the straw man is not you, look at your personal checks. Here is an 
example of a check. <br><br>
 
<img src="check.jpg" height="200" width="500"><br><br>

Notice the two read arrows. Their first arrow points to the all-caps name, John’s straw man. You 
will not find your true name on your checks. The second arrow points to the signature line that 
ends with the letters "MP" which stands for "micro-print". If you look carefully at the signature, 
you will notice that it is not a solid line. The line is made up of some words and spaces that are 
repeated over and over again as shown here. <br><br>
 
The next image shows a section of the signature line magnified 60 times. You can clearly see 
that the words that make up the line are "AUTHORIZED SIGNATURE." (You can also read 
about security features on checks on the "Deluxe" site.) <br><br>

 <img src="microprt.jpg"><br><br>

The reason the signature line on personal checks is made up of the words "AUTHORIZED 
SIGNATURE" is because it is a physical impossibility for the account holder (your straw man) 
to sign the check. Remember, your straw man has no hands with which to sign the check. The 
banks know that every signature appearing on a personal check is the signature of the flesh-and-
blood agent, the authorized representative, you. However, the words are printed in micro-print to 
disguise the fact that you are the authorized representative rather than the principal on the 
account. When you sign the check or any other document for the straw man, you are actually an 
accommodating party, i.e. surety, and therefore 100% liable for everything the principal (straw 
man) is liable for. Further proof that you are liable for the benefits you receive through your 
straw man.<br><br> 

Do not despair, there is a way out of this malaise. There are a couple of elements to a strategy to 
gain freedom. One element is to copyright your name (both your true name, the all-caps version 
and all it's derivatives). A second element is to use UCC filings to take control of your straw man 
(a process that is often called redemption). <br><br>

Names are nothing more than property. No one is his TRADE NAME (all-caps spelling of your 
name), nor is anyone his true name. A name can be trademarked, service-marked, and 
copyrighted by the owner for the purpose of restricting others form unauthorized use and unjust 
enrichment at the expense of the owner. If you are 18 or older, you, the flesh-and-blood man or 
woman, own your name and you may copyright it under the common law.<br><br> 

After copyrighting your name, no one will be able to use your name to enrich themselves without 
first gaining your agreement. Let's say a police officer pulled you over and wanted to give you a 
ticket. You can warn the officer that he is using your copyrighted name for financial benefit and 
that is a violation of your copyright. You should also inform him that to persist in the use of your 
copyrighted material without your permission carries an automatic penalty of $500,000. You 
have just formed a legally binding verbal contract with the officer. If the officer then persists in 
using your name without permission, he has breached the contract. You then have the right, 
under UCC article 9, to default judgment against them using non-judicial proceedings to collect 
on the debt that he owes you. This is a very powerful concept that can be used in dozens to 
hundreds of ways. <br><br>

The copyright notices also establishes a private contract between you and your straw man 
whereby you offer services to the straw man (e.g. signing documents for it) in exchange for 
certain considerations. You become the creditor over your straw man who becomes the debtor to 
you. You can file a UCC financing statement to receive official, government acknowledgment of 
this private contract. This UCC is a financing statement which creates an interest in property that 
secures payment/performance of an obligation by your straw man for the services you render to 
it. This UCC filing establishes a seniority position of claim over other creditors who may make a 
claim based upon date and time of filing. In this way, if any party ever attacks your straw man’s 
assets, you will have a superior claim on it.<br><br>

Exemption" and "Redemption".<br> <br>
