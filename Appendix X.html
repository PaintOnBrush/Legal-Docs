"An "ex post facto law" is defined as a law which provides for the infliction of punishment upon a
person for an act done which, when it was committed, was innocent; a law which aggravates a
crime or makes it greater than when it was committed; a law that changes the punishment
or inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when it was committed; a law that
hangs the rules of evidence and receives less or different testimony than was required at the time
of the commission of the offense in order to convict the offender; a law which, assuming to regulate
civil rights and remedies only, in effect imposes a penalty or the deprivation of a right which, when
done, was lawful; a law which deprives persons accused of crime of some lawful protection to
which they have become entitled, such as the protection of a former conviction or acquittal, or of
the proclamation of amnesty; every law which, in relation to the offense or its consequences, alters
the situation of a person to his disadvantage? Wilensky v. Fields, Fla, 267 So.2d 1,5."

</p>
<p>The following sites should be used in court as much as possible to discredit the process
being used in today's courts - the Law has always been there to protect the families, but the
corrupt system does not follow the Law, or enforce the Law equally. The rules being used to
deprive everyone's rights in the courts are unconstitutional, and the place the agency must be
challenged is at jurisdictional level. Without a crime, and charging someone with a crime, and
evidence of a crime, and an injured party, lawful warrant, probable cause and due process, the
judge is acting outside of his jurisdiction, and this is the case in most instances. Without
jurisdiction, it is a crime for the court to take your children, and lawfully they should be
returned.
</p>
<p><br>
You must challenge jurisdiction and once jurisdiction has been challenged, the court
cannot lawfully proceed until a hearing on jurisdiction is held. It is a violation of due process to
refuse this , or to bring you into any hearing without complete discovery. The court must answer
all questions (motions) before the court. You must demand these things, or they will not happen.
</p>
<p><br>
Where is the warrant? Where is the Petition? Where is the affidavit of Probable Cause must
accompany the Petition? Most often, the child stealing agencies do not have any of these things,
and are not operating in a lawful court of judicial due process.
</p>
<p><br>
Share these sites, demand your rights, as a sovereign Natural Person, do not give your
rights away by allowing a bar member to “represent” you to the court - he does not have
sovereign rights in the courtroom - only you do for yourself and your minor children, full rights,
sui juris, to "represent" them in the court.

</p>

</p>
<p><br>
"The Court stressed, "the parent child relationship is an important interest that undeniably
warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection." A parent's interest
in the companionship, care, custody and management of his or her children rises to a
constitutionally secured right, given the centrality of family life as the focus for personal meaning
and responsibility Stanley V Illinois 405 Us 645, 651; 92S or 1208, (1972)
