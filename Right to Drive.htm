      size=2 face=Verdana>For many years Professionals within the criminal 
      justice System have acted upon the belief that traveling by motor vehicle 
      upon the roadway was a privilege that was gained by a citizen only after 
      approval by their respective state government in the form of the issuance 
      of a permit or license to that Particular individual. Legislators, police 
      officers and court officials are becoming aware that there are now court 
      decisions that prove the fallacy of the legal opinion that" driving is a 
      privilege and therefore requires government approval, i.e. a license". 
      Some of these cases are:</FONT></DIV>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana><U>Case # 1</U> - "Even the 
      legislature has no power to deny to a citizen the <U>right</U> to travel 
      upon the highway and transport his property in the ordinary course of his 
      business or pleasure, though this right may be regulated in accordance 
      with the public interest and convenience.

      <BR>("Regulated" here means traffic safety enforcement, stop lights, 
      signs, etc. NOT a privilege that requires permission i.e.- licensing, 
      mandatory insurance, vehicle registration, etc.)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana><U>Case # 2</U> - "The right of 
      the citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his 
      property thereon, either by carriage or by automobile, is not a mere 
      privilege which a city may prohibit or permit at will, but a common right 
      which he has under the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
      happiness."- <U>Thompson v Smith 154 SE 579.</U></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>It could not be stated more 
      conclusively that Citizens of the states have a <U>right</U> to travel, 
      without approval or restriction (license), and that this right is 
      protected under the U.S. Constitution. Here are other court decisions that 
      expound the same facts:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana><U>Case # 3</U> - "The right to 
      travel is a part of the liberty of which the citizen cannot be deprived 
      without due process of law under the 5th Amendment." 
      -&nbsp;<U><ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><ST1:PLACE>Kent</ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana><U>Case # 4</U> - "Undoubtedly 
      the right of locomotion, the right to remove from one place to another 
      according to inclination, is an attribute of personal Iiberty, and the 
      right, ordinarily, of free transit from or through the territory of any 
      State is a right secured by the l4th Amendment and by other provisions of 
      the Constitution." - <U>Schactman v Dulles, 96 App D.C. 287, 
      293.</U></FONT></P>
      <P><U><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>FUNDAMENTAL 
      RIGHT</FONT></U></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>As hard as it is for those of 
      us in Law enforcement to believe, there is no room for speculation in 
      these court decisions. The American citizen does indeed have the 
      inalienable right to use the roadways unrestricted in any manner as long 
      as they are not damaging or violating property or rights of 
      another.</FONT></P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Government, in 
      requiring the people to file for "drivers licenses, vehicle registrations, 
      mandatory insurance, and demanding they stop for vehicle inspections, 
      DUI/DWI roadblocks etc. without question, are "restricting", and therefore 
      violating, the Peoples common law right to travel.&nbsp;</FONT>
      <DIV></DIV>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Is this a new legal 
      interpretation on this subject of the right to travel? Apparently not. The 
      American Citizens and Lawmen Association in conjunction with The U.S. 
      Federal Law Research Center are presently involved in studies in several 
      areas involving questions on constitutional law. One of the many areas 
      under review is the area of "Citizens right to travel." In an interview a 
      spokesmen stated: "Upon researching this subject over many months, 
      substantial case law has presented itself that completely substantiates 
      the position that the "right to travel unrestricted upon the nations 
      highways" is and has always been a fundamental <U>right</U> of every 
      Citizen."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>This means that the "beliefs 
      and opinions" our state legislators, the courts, and those of as involved 
      in the law enforcement profession have acted upon for years have been in 
      error. Researchers armed with actual facts state that U.S. case law is 
      overwhelming in determining that - to restrict, in any fashion, the 
      movement of the individual American in the free exercise of their right to 
      travel upon the roadways, (excluding "commerce" which the state 
      Legislatures are correct in regulating), is a serious breach of those 
      freedoms secured by the U.S. Constitution, and most state Constitutions, 
      i.e - <U>it is Unlawful.</U></FONT></P>
      <P><U><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>THE REVELATION THAT THE 
      AMERICAN CITIZEN HAS ALWAYS HAD THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO TRAVEL RAISES 
      PROFOUND QUESTIONS TO THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN MAKING AND ENFORCING STATE 
      LAWS.</FONT></U></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>The first of such questions may 
      very well be - If the States have been enforcing laws that are 
      unconstitutional on their face, it would seem that there must be some way 
      that a state can <U>legally</U> put restrictions, such as - licensing 
      requirements, mandatory insurance, vehicle registration, vehicle 
      inspections, D.W.I. roadblocks, to name just a few, on a Citizens 
      constitutionally protected right. Is that not so?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>For the answer to this question 
      let us Iook, once again, to 
      the&nbsp;<ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><ST1:PLACE>U.S.</ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> 
      courts for a determination on this very issue.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>The case of <U>Hertado 
      v.&nbsp;<ST1:STATE><ST1:PLACE>California</ST1:PLACE></ST1:STATE>, 
      110&nbsp;<ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><ST1:PLACE>U.S.</ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> 
      516.</U> states very plainly: "The State cannot diminish rights of the 
      people."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>"the assertion of federal 
      rights, when plainly and reasonably made, is not to be defeated under the 
      name of local practice."- <U>Davis v. Wechsler, 
      263&nbsp;<ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><ST1:PLACE>U.S.</ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> 
      22, 24.</U></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Would we not say that these 
      judicial decisions are straight to the point - that there is <U>no lawful 
      method</U> for government to put restrictions or Iimitations on rights 
      belonging to the people?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Other cases are even more 
      straight forward:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>"Where rights secured by the 
      Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation 
      which would abrogate them."<BR>- <U>Miranda 
      v.&nbsp;<ST1:STATE><ST1:PLACE>Arizona</ST1:PLACE></ST1:STATE>, 
      384&nbsp;<ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><ST1:PLACE>U.S.</ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> 
      436, 491.</U></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>"The claim and exercise of a 
      constitutional right cannot be converted into a crime.· - <U>Miller 
      v.&nbsp;<ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><ST1:PLACE>U.S.</ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION>, 
      230 F 2d 486, 489.</U></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>"There can be no sanction or 
      penalty imposed upon one because of this exercise of Constitutional 
      rights."- <U>Sherar v. Cullen, 481 F. 945.</U> ( There is no question that 
      a citation/ticket issued by a police officer, for no drivers license, no 
      current vehicle registration, no vehicle insurance etc. which carries a 
      fine or jail time, is a penalty or sanction, and is indeed "converting a 
      Right into a crime".)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>We could go on, quoting court 
      decision after court decision, however, In addition, the Constitution 
      itself answers our question- "Can a government <U>legally</U> put 
      restrictions on the rights of the American people at anytime, for any 
      reason"? (Such as in this particular case - when the government believes 
      it to be for the safety and welfare of the people).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>The answer is found in 
      <U>ARTICLE SIX</U> of the U.S. Constitution:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>"This Constitution, and the 
      Laws of the&nbsp;<ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><ST1:PLACE>United 
      States</ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> which shall be made in Pursuance 
      thereof;..shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the judges in every 
      State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any 
      State to the Contrary not withstanding". (This tells us that the U.S. 
      Constitution is to be upheld over any state, county, or city Iaws that are 
      in opposition to it.)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>In the same Article it goes on 
      to say just <U>who</U> it is within our governments that is bound by this 
      Supreme Law:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>"The Senators and 
      Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State 
      Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United 
      States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, 
      to support this Constitution;". - <U>ART. 
      6&nbsp;<ST1:COUNTRY-REGION><ST1:PLACE>U.S.</ST1:PLACE></ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> 
      CONST.</U></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>We know that Police officers, 
      are a part of the Executive branch. We are "Executive 
Officers".</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Article 6 above, is called the 
      SUPREMACY CLAUSE, and it clearly states that, under every circumstance, 
      the above listed officials in these United States <U>must</U> hold this 
      documents tenets <U>supreme</U> over any other laws, regulations, or 
      orders. Every U.S. Police officer knows that they have sworn a oath to the 
      people of our nation that we will not only protect their lives and 
      property, but, that we will uphold, and protect their freedoms and rights 
      under the Supreme laws of this nation, - the U. S. 
Constitution.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>In this regard then, we must 
      agree that those within government that restrict a Citizens rights, (such 
      as restricting the peoples right to travel,) are acting in violation of 
      his or her oath of office and are actually committing a crime against such 
      Citizens. Here's an interesting question. Is ignorance of these laws an 
      excuse for such acts by officials?</FONT></P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 
      face=Verdana>If we are to follow the "letter of the law (as we are sworn 
      to do), this places officials that involve themselves in such unlawful 
      acts in a unfavorable legal situation. For it is a felony and federal 
      crime to violate, or deprive citizens of their Constitutionally protected 
      rights.&nbsp;</FONT>
      <DIV></DIV>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Our system of law dictates the 
      fact that there are only two ways to legally remove a right belonging to 
      the people. These are - #1 - by lawfully amending the constitution, or #2 
      - by a person <U>knowingly</U> waiving a particular right.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Some of the confusion in our 
      present system has arisen because many millions of people have waived 
      their right to travel "unrestricted" upon the roadways of the states and 
      opted into the jurisdiction of the state for various reasons. Those who 
      have <U>knowingly</U> given up these rights are now <U>legally</U> 
      regulated by state law, the proper courts, and "sworn, constitutionally 
      empowered officers-of-the-law," and must acquire proper permits, 
      registrations, insurance, etc.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>There are basically two groups 
      of people in this category:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>#1 - Any citizen that involves 
      themselves in "commerce," (business for private gain), upon the highways 
      of the state.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Here is what the courts have 
      said about this:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>"...For while a citizen has the 
      right to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property 
      thereon, that right does not extend to the use of the highways, either in 
      whole or in part, as a place for <U>private gain</U>. For the latter 
      purpose no person has a vested right to use the highways of the state, but 
      is a privilege or license which the legislature may grant or withhold at 
      its discretion..." - <U>State v Johnson, 243 P. 1073, 1078.</U></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Other U.S. court cases that 
      confirm and point out the difference between the "right" of the citizen to 
      travel and a government "privilege" are - Barney v Board of Railroad 
      Commissioners; State v City of Spokane, 186 P. 864.; Ex Parte Dickey 
      (Dickey v Davis), 85 S.E. 781.; Teche Lines v Danforth, 12 So.2d 
      784.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>There are numerous other court 
      decisions that spell out the <U>JURISDICTION</U> issue In these two 
      distinctly different activities. However, because of space restrictions we 
      will leave it up to officers to research it further for themselves. (See 
      last page for additional references).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>#2 - The second group of 
      citizens that are legally under the jurisdiction of the state is the 
      individual citizen who has voluntarily and <U>knowingly</U> waived their 
      right to travel "unregulated and unrestricted" by requesting placement 
      under such jurisdiction through the acquisition of a state - drivers 
      license, vehicle registration, mandatory insurance, etc. (In other words 
      "by contract only".)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>We should remember what makes 
      this "legal," and not a violation of the individuals common law right to 
      travel "unrestricted" is that they <U>knowingly</U> volunteer, freely, by 
      contract, to waive their right. If they were forced, coerced or 
      unknowingly placed under the states powers, the courts have said it is a 
      clear violation of their rights.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>This in itself raises a very 
      interesting question. What percentage of the people in each state have 
      filed, and received, licenses, registrations, insurance etc. after 
      erroneously being advised by their government that it was 
      <U>mandatory</U>?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Many of our courts, attorneys 
      and police officials are just becoming informed about this important issue 
      and the difference between "Privileges vs. Rights". We can assume that the 
      majority of those Americans carrying state licenses, vehicle registrations 
      etc., have no knowledge of the rights they waived in obeying laws such as 
      these that the U.S. Constitution clearly states are unlawful, i.e. "laws 
      of no effect". In other words - "<U>LAWS THAT ARE NOT LAWS AT 
      ALL.</U>"</FONT></P>
      <P><U><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>OUR SWORN 
DUTY</FONT></U></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>An area of serious 
      consideration for every police officer, is to understand that the most 
      important law in our land he has taken an oath to protect, defend, <U>AND 
      ENFORCE</U>, is not state laws, nor city or county ordinances, but, that 
      law that supersede all other laws in our nation, - the U.S. Constitution. 
      If laws in a particular police officer's state, or local community are in 
      conflict with the SUPREME LAW of our nation, there Is no question that the 
      officer's duty is to "uphold the U.S. Constitution."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>What does this mean to the 
      "patrol officer" who will be the only sworn "Executive Officer" on the 
      scene, when knowledgeable Citizens raise serious objections over 
      possession of insurance, drivers licenses and other restrictions? It 
      definitely means these officers will be faced with a hard decision. (Most 
      certainly if that decision effects state, city or county revenues, such as 
      the issuing of citations do.)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Example: If a state legislator, 
      judge or a superior tells a police officer to proceed and enforce a 
      contradictory, (illegal), state law rather than the Supreme Law of this 
      country, what is that "sworn officer" to do? Although we may not want to 
      hear it, there is but one right answer, - "the officer is duty bound to 
      uphold his oath of office" and obey the highest laws of the nation. 
      <U>THIS IS OUR SWORN DUTY AND IT'S THE LAW</U>!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Such a strong honest stand 
      taken by a police officer, upholding his or her oath of office, takes 
      moral strength of character. It will, without question, "<U>SEPARATE THE 
      MEN FROM THE BOYS.</U>" Such honest and straight forward decisions on 
      behalf of a government official have often caused pressure to be applied 
      to force such officers to set aside, or compromise their morals or 
      convictions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>As a solace for those brave 
      souls in uniform that will stand up for law and justice, even when it's 
      unpopular, or uncomfortable to do so...let me say this. In any legal 
      stand-off over a sworn official "violating" or "upholding" their oath of 
      office, those that would side with the "violation" should inevitable 
      <U>lose.</U></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Our Founding Fathers assured 
      us, on many occasions, the following: Defending our freedoms in the face 
      of people that would for "expedients sake," or behind the guise, "for the 
      safety and welfare of the masses," ignore peoples rights, would forever 
      demand <U>sacrifice</U> and <U>vigilance</U> from those that desired to 
      remain free. That sounds a little like - "Freedom is not 
      free!"</FONT></P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>Every police 
      officer should keep the following court ruling, that was covered earlier, 
      in mind before issuing citations in regard to "mandatory licensing, 
      registration and insurance" - verses - "the right of the people to travel 
      unencumbered":</FONT>
      <DIV></DIV>

      <P><FONT color=#000000 size=2 face=Verdana>And as we have seen, "traveling 
      freely," going about ones daily activities, is the exercise of a <U>most
