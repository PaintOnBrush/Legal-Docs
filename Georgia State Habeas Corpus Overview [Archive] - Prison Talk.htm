      <DIV class=posttext>STATE HABEAS CORPUS IN GEORGIA:<BR><BR><BR>I. 
      INTRODUCTION<BR><BR>A state habeas corpus action is by far the most 
      important postconviction remedy available to an individual under 
      conviction and sentence. An underlying premise of these materials is that 
      most criminal defense attorneys never prepare or litigate a state habeas 
      corpus petition. One purpose of these materials is to explain how criminal 
      defense attorneys play a critical role in laying the foundation for a 
      successful state habeas corpus action.<BR><BR>Another purpose of these 
      materials is to provide the reader with a basic understanding of state 
      habeas corpus actions and to familiarize the reader with the basic 
      statutes and doctrines pertaining to the filing and litigation of a state 
      habeas corpus action. There are many nuances pertaining to this area of 
      the law, and the materials herein do not attempt to address all of those 
      nuances. Additionally, these materials do not address the filing and 
      litigation of a state habeas corpus petition which challenges a death 
      sentence. <BR><BR>The format of these materials in Sections II, III, IV, 
      and V will be to first pose a relevant question concerning state habeas 
      corpus actions; to provide the reader with a succinct answer to the 
      question; to provide the reader with the text of the statute relevant to 
      the question if there is such a statute; and finally in some instances to 
      provide the reader with practice suggestions concerning the filing and 
      litigation of state habeas corpus actions. <BR><BR>II. WHAT IS HABEAS 
      CORPUS?<BR><BR>Literally speaking, habeas corpus is Latin for “that you 
      have the body”. A writ of habeas corpus is employed most frequently to 
      bring an imprisoned person before a court in order to ensure that the 
      person’s imprisonment is constitutional. In Georgia, habeas corpus actions 
      are governed by the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 9-14-40 through § 9-14-53. 
      <BR><BR>III. WHY STATE HABEAS CORPUS ACTIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO TRIAL 
      ATTORNEYS<BR><BR>When a trial attorney’s client is convicted and sentenced 
      based upon a trial which was unfair and unconstitutional, and the client’s 
      conviction and sentence are affirmed on direct appeal, a state habeas 
      corpus action provides that client with the best opportunity to vacate the 
      conviction and sentence, to vindicate the client’s constitutional rights, 
      and to provide the client with a new trial.<BR><BR>PRACTICE NOTE: State 
      habeas corpus actions in most cases represent the client’s last 
      opportunity to call witnesses and develop a record in order to demonstrate 
      that the client’s conviction and sentence are unconstitutional. 
      <BR><BR>IV. WHY TRIAL ATTORNEYS ARE IMPORTANT TO STATE HABEAS 
      ACTIONS<BR><BR>Obviously the goal of a trial attorney is to win the 
      client’s case at trial. A secondary goal is to preserve the record in case 
      the client does not prevail at trial and a direct appeal is necessary. A 
      further goal of the trial attorney should be to protect the record for a 
      possible state habeas corpus action in case the client’s direct appeal is 
      not successful. <BR><BR>When a client’s case is reviewed during a state 
      habeas corpus action or during a federal habeas corpus action, that review 
      will be limited to a determination of whether the client's state or 
      federal constitutional rights were violated during the client’s trial or 
      during the client’s direct appeal. Consequently, trial counsel, in 
      preserving error, should base their objections on state and federal 
      constitutional grounds when appropriate. <BR><BR>PRACTICE NOTE: Always 
      consider filing a motion for new trial in order to constitutionalize 
      issues in the motion for new trial which were not constitutionalized 
      during the trial. <BR><BR>V. STATE HABEAS CORPUS ACTIONS: BASIC DOCTRINES 
      AND STATUTES<BR><BR>A. PERSONS ELIGIBLE TO SEEK RELIEF<BR><BR>1. 
      Individuals Who Are In Physical Custody<BR><BR>Relief may be sought by the 
      filing of a state habeas corpus application by any individual imprisoned 
      based upon a sentence imposed by a Georgia court who contends that the 
      individual is in custody as the result of the denial of the individual’s 
      state or federal constitutional rights.<BR><BR>§ 9-14-42(a): Any person 
      imprisoned by virtue of a sentence imposed by a state court of record who 
      asserts that in the proceedings which resulted in his conviction there was 
      a substantial denial of his rights under the Constitution of the United 
      States or of this state may institute a proceeding under this 
      article.<BR><BR>2. Individuals Who Are Not In Physical 
      Custody<BR><BR>Relief may also be available to an individual who is not in 
      physical custody but who is suffering from adverse collateral consequences 
      (e.g., being on probation, not being able to vote) as a result of the 
      individual’s conviction and/or sentence. See Hardison v. Martin, 254 Ga. 
      719, 334 S.E.2d 780 (1989). <BR><BR>B. STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS APPLICABLE 
      TO THE FILING OF A STATE HABEAS CORPUS PETITION<BR><BR>1. State Statute Of 
      Limitations<BR><BR>a. Felony convictions which have become final[1] 
      (http://www.prisontalk.com/forums/newthread.php?do=newthread&amp;f=1338#_ftn1) 
      on or before July 1, 2004<BR><BR>For felony convictions which became final 
      on or before July 1, 2004, the action must be filed on or before July 1, 
      2008.<BR><BR>b. Felony convictions which have become final subsequent to 
      July 1, 2004<BR><BR>For felony convictions which become final subsequent 
      to July 1, 2004, the action must be filed within four years of the 
      conviction having become final.<BR><BR>c. Misdemeanor convictions 
      <BR><BR>For most misdemeanor convictions, the actions must be filed within 
      one year of the conviction becoming final. For misdemeanor convictions of 
      traffic offenses, the actions must be filed within 180 days of the date 
      the conviction becomes final. <BR><BR>§ 9-14-42(c): Any action brought 
      pursuant to this article shall be filed within one year in the case of a 
      misdemeanor, except as otherwise provided in Code Section 40-13-33, or 
      within four years in the case of a felony, other than one challenging a 
      conviction for which a death sentence has been imposed or challenging a 
      sentence of death, from: <BR><BR>(1) The judgment of conviction becoming 
      final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for 
      seeking such review; provided, however, that any person whose conviction 
      has become final as of July 1, 2004, regardless of the date of conviction, 
      shall have until July 1, 2005, in the case of a misdemeanor or until July 
      1, 2008, in the case of a felony to bring an action pursuant to this Code 
      section.<BR><BR>§ 9-14-42(d): At the time of sentencing, the court shall 
      inform the defendant of the periods of limitation set forth in subsection 
      (c) of this Code section.<BR><BR>§ 40-13-33(a): Any challenge to a 
      misdemeanor conviction of any of the traffic laws of this state or the 
      traffic laws of any county or municipal government which may be brought 
      pursuant to Chapter 14 of Title 9 must be filed within 180 days of the 
      date the conviction becomes final.<BR><BR>PRACTICE NOTE: At the time of 
      sentencing, counsel should be certain that their client has been advised 
      of the applicable state statute of limitation. If the sentencing court has 
      not so advised, counsel should remind the sentencing court of its 
      obligation to do so under § 9-14-42(d)<BR><BR>2. Federal Statute Of 
      Limitations<BR><BR>There is a one year statute of limitations for seeking 
      federal habeas corpus relief. The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death 
      Penalty Act (hereinafter the "AEDPA") became effective on April 24, 1996 
      and amended 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d) by imposing a one-year statute of 
      limitations for the filing of a federal habeas corpus petition under 28 
      U.S.C. § 2254. The practical effect of this provision is to require an 
      individual in state custody who seeks federal habeas corpus relief to file 
      the individual’s federal habeas corpus petition within one year of the 
      date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review 
      or the expiration of the time for seeking such review. Before an 
      individual in state custody can pursue federal habeas corpus relief, that 
      individual must exhaust state remedies, which is usually the filing and 
      the litigation of a state habeas corpus action. While the individual in 
      state custody exhausts the available state remedies, the one-year statute 
      of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d) is tolled. Attached hereto 
      as Appendix 4 is a timeline depicting the effect, under 28 U.S.C. § 
      2244(d), of the filing of a state habeas corpus action on the deadline for 
      the filing of a federal habeas corpus petition.<BR><BR>28 U.S.C. § 
      2244(d):<BR><BR>(1) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an 
      application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to 
      the judgment of a State court. The limitation period shall run from the 
      latest of --<BR><BR>(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the 
      conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such 
      review;<BR><BR>(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an 
      application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or 
      laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from 
      filing such State action;<BR><BR>(C) the date on which the constitutional 
      right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right 
      has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively 
      applicable to cases on collateral review; or<BR><BR>(D) the date on which 
      the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been 
      discovered through the exercise of due diligence.<BR><BR>(2) The time 
      during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or 
      other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is 
      pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this 
      subsection.<BR><BR>PRACTICE NOTE: In order for a client to receive the 
      benefit of newly decided case law, counsel can extend the time of the 
      conviction becoming final by: (1) always filing the appropriate type of 
      appeal to the Supreme Court of Georgia and (2) by filing a petition for 
      writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States. Keep in mind 
      that "final" is defined as the conclusion of direct review or the 
      expiration of the time for seeking such review. <BR><BR>C. JURISDICTION 
      OVER AND VENUE FOR A STATE HABEAS CORPUS ACTION <BR><BR>Superior courts 
      have exclusive jurisdiction of habeas corpus actions. If the petitioner is 
      in custody in the State of Georgia, venue lies in the county in which the 
      petitioner is being detained. If the petitioner is in custody in another 
      state or under the authority of the United States, venue lies in the 
      county in which the conviction was imposed. If the petitioner is not in 
      custody, venue lies in the county in which the conviction was imposed. 
      <BR><BR>§ 9-14-43: A petition brought under this article must be filed in 
      the superior court of the county in which the petitioner is being 
      detained. The superior courts of such counties shall have exclusive 
      jurisdiction of habeas corpus actions arising under this article. If the 
      petitioner is not in custody or is being detained under the authority of 
      the United States, any of the several states other than Georgia, or any 
      foreign state, the petition must be filed in the superior court of the 
      county in which the conviction and sentence which is being challenged was 
      imposed.<BR><BR>PRACTICE NOTE: Counsel for a petitioner incarcerated in 
      the State of Georgia has some ability to control the venue in which the 
      state habeas corpus action is litigated.<BR><BR><BR>D. LIMITATIONS ON 
      NUMBER OF STATE HABEAS CORPUS ACTIONS MAY BE FILED<BR><BR>With a few 
      exceptions, a petitioner only has one opportunity to obtain relief through 
      a state habeas corpus action. Any grounds not raised in the original 
      petition or the amended petition will be waived.<BR><BR>§ 9-14-51: All 
      grounds for relief claimed by a petitioner for a writ of habeas corpus 
      shall be raised by a petitioner in his original or amended petition. Any 
      grounds not so raised are waived unless the Constitution of the United 
      States or of this state otherwise requires or unless any judge to whom the 
      petition is assigned, on considering a subsequent petition, finds grounds 
      for relief asserted therein which could not reasonably have been raised in 
      the original or amended petition.<BR><BR>PRACTICE NOTE: While counsel 
      should advise individuals not to proceed pro se in a state habeas corpus 
      action if the individual might be able to proceed with counsel at a later 
      date but within the applicable state statute of limitations, this course 
      of action creates the danger that by following such advice, the individual 
      will lose the right to seek relief in federal court at a later date as a 
      result of the statute of limitations under the AEDPA. (See Section V 
      (B)(2) above).<BR><BR>E. THE FORM THAT MUST BE USED FOR FILING A STATE 
      HABEAS CORPUS PETITION, THE REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS THERETO AND OPTIONAL 
      SUPPORTING LEGAL ARGUMENTS THAT MAY ACCOMPANY ITS FILING <BR><BR>Form HC-1 
      from the Administrative Office of the Courts must be utilized when filing 
      a state habeas corpus petition. That form is available online at 
      www.georgiacourts.org (http://www.georgiacourts.org). (Use the drop down 
      menu for “Court Forms”; select “Inmate Forms”, and at the bottom there 
      will be a section entitled, “Inmate/Habeas Corpus Forms”). This form must 
      be signed by the petitioner in the presence of a notary public. <BR><BR>If 
      the petitioner is requesting to proceed in forma pauperis, a motion to 
      proceed in forma pauperis must be filed with the petition and must include 
      a print-out of the petitioner’s prison account. <BR><BR>§ 9-14-44: A 
      petition brought under this article shall identify the proceeding in which 
      the petitioner was convicted, give the date of rendition of the final 
      judgment complained of, clearly set forth the respects in which the 
      petitioner's rights were violated, and state with specificity which claims 
      were raised at trial or on direct appeal, providing appropriate citations 
      to the trial or appellate record. The petition shall have attached thereto 
      affidavits, records, or other evidence supporting its allegations or shall 
      state why the same are not attached. The petition shall identify any 
      previous proceedings that the petitioner may have taken to secure relief 
      from his or her conviction and, in the case of prior habeas corpus 
      petitions, shall state which claims were previously raised. Argument and 
      citations of authorities shall be omitted from the petition; however, a 
      brief may be submitted in support of the petition setting forth any 
      applicable argument. The petition must be verified by the oath of the 
      applicant or of some other person in his or her behalf.<BR><BR>PRACTICE 
      NOTE: The contents of the petition can be amended by the petitioner at any 
      time prior to the hearing on the petitioner’s state habeas corpus action. 
      See O.C.G.A. § 9-11-15(a); Nelson v. Zant, 261 Ga. 358, 359, 405 S.E.2d 
      250 (1991).<BR><BR>F. PARTIES TO BE SERVED WITH HABEAS PETITION AND 
      SUPPORTING PAPERS<BR><BR>If the petitioner is in custody, the petition 
      must be served upon the person having custody of the petitioner 
      (typically, the warden of the petitioner’s institution). If the petitioner 
      is under the custody of the Georgia Department of Corrections 
      (hereinafter, the GDOC), an additional copy of the petition must be served 
      upon the Attorney General of Georgia. If the petitioner is under the 
      custody of some authority other than the GDOC, an additional copy must be 
      served upon the district attorney of the county in which the petition is 
      filed. <BR><BR>§ 9-14-45: Service of a petition brought under this article 
      shall be made upon the person having custody of the petitioner. If the 
      petitioner is being detained under the custody of the Department of 
      Corrections, an additional copy of the petition shall be served on the 
      Attorney General. If the petitioner is being detained under the custody of 
      some authority other than the Department of Corrections, an additional 
      copy of the petition shall be served upon the district attorney of the 
      county in which the petition is filed. Service upon the Attorney General 
      or the district attorney may be had by mailing a copy of the petition and 
      a proper certificate of service.<BR><BR><BR>PRACTICE SUGGESTION: Check 
      with the clerk of court to make sure that you have complied with that 
      county’s particular service requirements for service upon the warden of 
      the petitioner’s institution, if the petitioner is in custody.<BR><BR>G. 
      TIME FOR RESPONDENT TO ANSWER THE PETITION<BR><BR>Unless the time is 
      extended by the superior court, the respondent must answer the petition 
      within twenty days of the filing and docketing of the petition. <BR><BR>§ 
      9-14-47: Except as otherwise provided in Code Section 9-14-47.1 with 
      respect to petitions challenging for the first time state court 
      proceedings resulting in a sentence of death, within 20 days after the 
      filing and docketing of a petition under this article or within such 
      further time as the court may set, the respondent shall answer or move to 
      dismiss the petition. The court shall set the case for a hearing on the 
      issues within a reasonable time after the filing of defensive 
      pleadings.<BR><BR>H. ENTITLEMENT TO A NON-EVIDENTIARY HEARING<BR><BR>The 
      petitioner is entitled to a non-evidentiary hearing on the issues raised 
      in the petition. The superior court is required to schedule the hearing 
      within a reasonable amount of time after the filing of defensive 
      pleadings. (See OCGA § 9-14-47 in Section G above). With respect to the 
      petitioner’s right to an evidentiary hearing, see Section V(N) below. 
      <BR><BR>PRACTICE NOTE: Keep in mind that there is some flexibility as to 
      when the state habeas corpus action is litigated. If the petitioner is not 
      prepared to proceed at the time of the hearing, the petitioner can move to 
      dismiss the action without prejudice and can re-file the state habeas 
      corpus action at a later date. See O.C.G.A. § 9-11-41(a).<BR><BR>I. 
      DEFENSES LIKELY TO BE ASSERTED BY THE RESPONDENT<BR><BR>1. Procedural 
      Default <BR><BR>The respondent may assert that the petitioner failed to 
      make a timely motion or objection to the constitutional error or otherwise 
      failed to comply with Georgia procedural rules at trial or on appeal. 
      <BR><BR>§ 9-14-48(d): The court shall review the trial record and 
      transcript of proceedings and consider whether the petitioner made timely 
      motion or objection or otherwise complied with Georgia procedural rules at 
      trial and on appeal and whether, in the event the petitioner had new 
      counsel subsequent to trial, the petitioner raised any claim of 
      ineffective assistance of trial counsel on appeal; and absent a showing of 
      cause for noncompliance with such requirement, and of actual prejudice, 
      habeas corpus relief shall not be granted. In all cases habeas corpus 
      relief shall be granted to avoid a miscarriage of justice. If the court 
      finds in favor of the petitioner, it shall enter an appropriate order with 
      respect to the judgment or sentence challenged in the proceeding and such 
      supplementary orders as to rearraignment, retrial, custody, or discharge 
      as may be necessary and proper.<BR><BR>2. Res Judicata<BR><BR>The 
      respondent may assert that the petitioner raised the issue on direct 
      appeal, that the decision was decided on direct appeal adversely to the 
      petitioner, and that the issue, therefore, is precluded from review during 
      the state habeas corpus action. Hall v. Vargas, 278 Ga. 868, 608 S.E.2d 
      200 (2005). <BR><BR>J. OVERCOMING THE RESPONDENT’S DEFENSES<BR><BR>1. 
      Procedural Default: Cause and Prejudice <BR><BR>The defense of procedural 
      default may be overcome if the petitioner demonstrates that there was 
      adequate cause for the noncompliance with the Georgia procedural rules and 
      that there was actual prejudice from the constitutional error. (See OCGA § 
      9-14-48(d) in Section V(I)(1) above).<BR><BR>2. Res Judicata: New Facts Or 
      New Case Law<BR><BR>The defense of res judicata may be overcome if the 
      petitioner demonstrates that the petitioner can carry the burden of proof 
      based upon a change in the facts or a change in the case law which have 
      occurred since the issue was decided on direct appeal. See Bruce v. Smith, 
      274 Ga. 432, 434, 553 S.E.2d 808, 810 ( 2001).<BR><BR>3. Miscarriage Of 
      Justice<BR><BR>The petitioner is entitled to relief regardless of the 
      defenses asserted by the respondent if the petitioner can demonstrate that 
      the failure to grant relief will result in a miscarriage of justice. See 
      OCGA § 9-14-48(d). See also Valenzuela v. Newsome, 253 Ga. 793, 795-797, 
      325 S.E.2d 370, 373-374 (1985)(“we must not become so engrossed in the 
      searching out of procedural faults which sometimes intrude in convicting 
      the guilty that we forget the core purpose of the writ--which is to free 
      the innocent wrongfully deprived of their liberty. Hence, on rare 
      occasion, the writ must pass over procedural bars and the requirements of 
      cause and prejudice, when that shall be necessary to avoid a miscarriage 
      of justice”).<BR><BR>K. THE BURDEN OF PROOF AND WHO SHOULDERS IT<BR><BR>In 
      a habeas corpus proceeding, the burden of proof is on the petitioner. The 
      petitioner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the conviction 
      under attack is invalid because a constitutional right was violated. 
      Gaither v. Gibby, 267 Ga. 96, 97, 475 S.E.2d 603 (1996).<BR><BR>L THE 
      METHODS OF PROOF<BR><BR>The case may be proven through the utilization of 
      depositions, oral testimony, sworn affidavits, or other evidence. 
      <BR><BR>§ 9-14-48:<BR><BR>(a) The court may receive proof by depositions, 
      oral testimony, sworn affidavits, or other evidence. No other forms of 
      discovery shall be allowed except upon leave of court and a showing of 
      exceptional circumstances.<BR><BR>(b) The taking of depositions or 
      depositions upon written questions by either party shall be governed by 
      Code Sections 9-11-26 through 9-11-32 and 9-11-37; provided, however, that 
      the time allowed in Code Section 9-11-31 for service of cross-questions 
      upon all other parties shall be ten days from the date the notice and 
      written <BR>questions are served.<BR><BR>PRACTICE NOTE: Keep in mind that 
      there is a fair amount of flexibility in how to prove the petitioner’s 
      case during the state habeas corpus action.<BR><BR>M. CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER 
      WHICH ADDITIONAL AFFIDAVITS ARE ADMISSIBLE AFTER FILING OF 
      PETITION<BR><BR>A superior court judge may resolve disputed questions of 
      fact based upon sworn affidavits standing alone. In order for the 
      affidavits to be admissible, however, the petitioner must adhere to the 
      strict requirements of O.C.G.A. §9-14-48(c).<BR><BR>§ 9-14-48(c): If sworn 
      affidavits are intended by either party to be introduced into evidence, 
      the party intending to introduce such an affidavit shall cause it to be 
      served upon the opposing party at least ten days in advance of the date 
      set for a hearing in the case. The affidavit so served shall include the 
      address and telephone number of the affiant, home or business, if known, 
      to provide the opposing party a reasonable opportunity to contact the 
      affiant; failure to include this information in any affidavit shall render 
      the affidavit inadmissible. The affidavit shall also be accompanied by a 
      notice of the party's intention to introduce it into evidence. The 
      superior court judge considering the petition for writ of habeas corpus 
      may resolve disputed issues of fact upon the basis of sworn affidavits 
      standing by themselves.<BR><BR>PRACTICE NOTE: Affidavits provide the 
      petitioner with the ability to prove the case in an economical and 
      controlled manner. Of course, the respondent may choose to subpoena the 
      affiant, but the petitioner will have committed the affiant to the 
      information contained in the affiant’s affidavit. <BR><BR>N. PETITIONER’S 
      RIGHT TO AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING<BR><BR>A state habeas corpus petition may 
      be dismissed without an evidentiary hearing only when the petition is 
      without merit on its face. See Rickett v. State, 276 Ga. 609, 581 S.E.2d 
      32 (2003); Mitchell v. Forrester, 247 Ga. 622, 278 S.E.2d 368 
      (1981).<BR><BR>An evidentiary hearing is usually required when a claim of 
      ineffective assistance of counsel has been raised, because such claims 
      usually cannot be resolved based upon the content of the petition. Zant v. 
      Dick, 249 Ga. 799, 294 S.E.2d 508, 509 (1982). <BR><BR>PRACTICE NOTE: Keep 
      in my mind that certain claims are usually not procedurally defaulted 
      prior to the filing of a state habeas corpus action. These include claims 
      of ineffective assistance of counsel, violations of Brady v. Maryland, 373 
      U.S. 83 (1963), prosecutorial misconduct, juror misconduct, and judicial 
      misconduct. With respect to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, 
      the habeas attorney investigate and assess all such claims, including 
      claims concerning trial counsel, motion for new trial counsel, and direct 
      appeal counsel. Oftentimes claims of ineffective assistance of counsel can 
      be utilized as conduits to other constitutional errors that may be 
      procedurally defaulted.<BR><BR>O. THE DECISION BY THE SUPERIOR COURT 
      <BR><BR>In rendering a decision, it is incumbent upon the superior court 
      to make written findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the 
      decision is based.<BR><BR>§ 9-14-49: After reviewing the pleadings and 
      evidence offered at the trial of the case, the judge of the superior court 
      hearing the case shall make written findings of fact and conclusions of 
      law upon which the judgment is based. The findings of fact and conclusions 
      of law shall be recorded as part of the record of the 
      case.<BR><BR>PRACTICE NOTE: With the superior court’s permission, it is 
      usually a good idea to prepare proposed findings of fact and conclusions 
      of law which set forth the reasons as to why the petitioner is entitled to 
      relief.<BR><BR>P. COURT POSSESSING JURISDICTION ON APPEAL FROM THE 
      DECISION OF THE SUPERIOR COURT<BR><BR>The Supreme Court of Georgia has 
      exclusive jurisdiction over appeals in habeas corpus actions brought 
      pursuant to O.C.G.A. §9-14-40 et seq..<BR>§ 9-14-52(a): Appeals in habeas 
      corpus cases brought under this article shall be governed by Chapter 6 of 
      Title 5 except that as to final orders of the court which are adverse to 
      the petitioner no appeal shall be allowed unless the Supreme Court of this 
      state issues a certificate of probable cause for the appeal.<BR><BR>Q. 
      PETITIONER’S RIGHT TO APPEAL SUPERIOR COURT DENIAL OF HABEAS PETITION NOT 
      ABSOLUTE<BR><BR>The petitioner does not have an absolute right to an 
      appeal from an adverse decision by the superior court. Within thirty days 
      from the entry of the order denying relief, the petitioner must file a 
      notice of appeal with the clerk of the superior court and, also within 
      that timeframe, must file a written application for a certificate of 
      probable cause (“CPC”) to appeal with the clerk of the Supreme Court of 
      Georgia. If the CPC is granted, the decision by the superior court will be 
      reviewed by the Supreme Court of Georgia. If the CPC is denied by the 
      Supreme Court of Georgia, the decision by the superior court will not be 
      reviewed on appeal by the Supreme Court of Georgia.<BR><BR>§ 9-14-52(b): 
      If an unsuccessful petitioner desires to appeal, he must file a written 
      application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal with the clerk 
      of the Supreme Court within 30 days from the entry of the order denying 
      him relief. The petitioner shall also file within the same period a notice 
      of appeal with the clerk of the concerned superior court. The Supreme 
      Court shall either grant or deny the application within a reasonable time 
      after filing. In order for the Supreme Court to consider fully the request 
      for a certificate, the clerk of the concerned superior court shall 
      forward, as in any other case, the record and transcript, if designated, 
      to the clerk of the Supreme Court when a notice of appeal is filed. The 
      clerk of the concerned superior court need not prepare and retain and the 
      court reporter need not file a copy of the original record and a copy of 
      the original transcript of proceedings. The clerk of the Supreme Court 
      shall return the original record and transcript to the clerk of the 
      concerned superior court upon completion of the appeal if the certificate 
      is granted. If the Supreme Court denies the application for a certificate 
      of probable cause, the clerk of the Supreme Court shall return the 
      original record and transcript and shall notify the clerk of the concerned 
      superior court and the parties to the proceedings below of the 
      determination that probable cause does not exist for appeal.<BR><BR>R. 
      RESPONDENT’S RIGHT TO APPEAL SUPERIOR COURT GRANTING OF HABEAS PETITION IS 
      ABSOLUTE <BR><BR>If the decision by the superior court is adverse to the 
      respondent, the respondent has an absolute right to an appeal to the 
      Supreme Court of Georgia. <BR><BR>§ 9-14-52(c): If the trial court finds 
      in favor of the petitioner, no certificate of probable cause need be 
      obtained by the respondent as a condition precedent to appeal. A notice of 
      appeal filed by the respondent shall act as a supersedeas and shall stay 
      the judgment of the superior court until there is a final adjudication by 
      the Supreme Court; provided, however, that, while such case is on appeal, 
      the petitioner may be released on bail as is provided in criminal cases 
      except when the petitioner has been convicted of a crime which the Supreme 
      Court has jurisdiction to consider on direct appeal. The right to bail and 
      the amount of bond shall be within the discretion of the judge of the 
      superior court in which the sentence successfully challenged under this 
      article was originally imposed.<BR><BR>S. PETITIONER’S RIGHT TO PETITION 
      THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI<BR><BR>The 
      petitioner, within 90 days from the final order entered by the Supreme 
      Court of Georgia, can file a petition for writ of certiorari in the 
      Supreme Court of the United States. (See Rule 13.1 of the Rules of the 
      Supreme Court of the United States). The filing of a petition for writ of 
      certiorari continues to toll the one year statute of limitations under the 
      AEDPA. (See Section V(B)(2)).<BR><BR>VI. CONCLUSION<BR><BR>In most cases, 
      the most important postconviction remedy available to an individual under 
      conviction and sentence is a state habeas corpus action. Hopefully the 
      preceding materials have impressed the reader with this fact and have 
      provided the reader with information which will be helpful in representing 
      clients at trial and in state habeas corpus actions. <BR><BR><BR>[1]

      <DIV class=posttext>thanks for posting that. When I saw your screen name 
      as "Paralegal USA" I wondered if the information would be general, or 
      relevant to the federal system only, but it's very state-specific to 
      Georgia too. It looks like excellent coverage of this topic.<BR><BR>I 
      heard that Habeas actions aren't just for people physically in custody. 
      They can be used when your freedom is limited by any past conviction or 
      sentence, even for collateral consequences that don't rear their heads and 
      become problems until later. <BR><BR>But then, how would the 4-year state 
      Statute of Limitations work? By the time somebody does their time and gets 
      out of prison and then discovers some other right that they've lost, the 
      time to sue for Habeas will be up.</DIV></DIV>
