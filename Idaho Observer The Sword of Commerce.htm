<P>From the February 2001 Idaho Observer: 
<HR>

<P><B>The Sword of Commerce </B> 
<P><B>By Hari Heath  </B> 
<P> Very few citizens pay any attention to the foundations and  limitations of 
governmental authority. Most assume that  government can do what it does.  Fewer 
still do anything to  turn back the tide of a government that has breached the 
 levy of the Constitution. And what is this tide that has  ruptured the 
foundations of our nation? An exponentially  expanding socialism which wields 
the sword of commerce. 
<P> Socialism is that scheme by which our individual rights,  secured by a 
republic, are converted to privileges granted  by those who operate a democracy; 
the form of governance  where the liberty and property of the individual is 
 surrendered under the pretense of the common good. The  common good, of course, 
is defined by the socialists who  seek to revoke your rights and grant 
privileges to you as  they see fit. So what does this have to do with commerce? 
 It's as simple as two of our American icons, the car and  the gun.  
<P> First the car  
<P> If you ask almost anyone today whether the law requires a  driver to be 
licensed before they can drive a car on the  highway, the answer will be a 
resounding yes. How do we  know it's true? By constant reinforcement of the 
idea, we  believe it. For generations it has been a  "requirement." Turning 16 
and getting your  drivers license has become the great American rite of 
 passage.  
<P> Policemen everywhere are ready to pull you over for any   "violation" and 
ask the first question, may I see  your license? The court calendars are filled 
with people  caught driving without "privileges." TV shows and  newspapers 
reinforce the belief that "it's the  law." But is it?  How did our right to 
travel become a  privilege? Let's look at the origins of this  "law" and see if 
the believers really have  anything to believe in.  In the beginning, we rode 
horses.  No one needed a license for that.  
<P> Traveling was such a fundamental right, that everyone took  it for granted.  
Then came the contraption known as the  automobile. As the technology progressed 
and availability  increased, the freedom of travel became available to anyone 
 who could afford the means to start,  stop and steer.  The  automobile has done 
much to change the face of American  society. It also has been the source of 
many  "problems" in our society.   
<P> With any freedom comes responsibility. Those who fail to  assume their 
responsibilities are the food that socialist  governments feed upon.  Automotive 
transport has many  benefits, but its negative side has become a great public 
 trough providing the three phases of hegelian opportunity:  Find or create the 
problem; offer the solution; extract the  price.  
<P> Compelled responsibility is the corner stone of socialist  government.  
There is a problem with such unbridled  socialism. Governments were originally 
formed by  constitutions which limit their intrusions and protect the  rights of 
the citizenry. Those pesky rights to life,  liberty, property and the pursuit of 
happiness can get in  the way of the free flow of legislation. The constitutions 
 provide and specify the subjects that can be legislated on.  
<P> Most constitutions predate the automobile. How would  government control the 
automobile when the constitutions do  not grant them any authority to do so? 
Constitutions can be  amended, but using that process would admit to the many 
 limitations of government. Government doesn't want to have  to amend the 
constitution every time it grapples for  another increase in power.  
<P>The socialists have another solution. Abandon   constitutional limitations 
when it is inconvenient to their  goals and lay down new laws under the guise of 
beneficial  and necessary purposes. Few will claim their rights  trampled by 
such laws until well after they are gone.   
<P> Slowly this method creeps, like a vine crawling up a brick  wall, until its 
roots have permeated the mortar, its leaves  cover the wall, and the weed of 
socialism is the only part  of the wall still visible. The Constitution, like 
the  bricks in the wall, becomes the obscure foundation for the  many leaves and 
tangled vines of the parasitical plant and  its new facade. Once in place, it is 
difficult to remove  and almost always grows back. 
<P> The Sword of Commerce 
<P> Back in the days when government was a public servant, not  the public's 
master, the roadways belonged to the people  who had a long-standing right to 
use them. The control of  automotive transport began when the private use of the 
 public highway resulted in profits. Article 7, Section 2 of  the Idaho 
Constitution authorizes a license tax upon  persons and corporations doing 
business in this state. In  the early years of automotive history, many local 
and state  jurisdictions around the country used a similar authority  to license 
and tax the commercial use of the public roads.  The courts agreed with this 
constitutionally valid and  limited authority to license commercial travel: 
<P> "The statutory requirement that licenses be procured  for motor vehicles 
used upon the highways is based on the  servitude put on the highways by such 
use and the advantage  which the improved highways may afford the business in 
 which the motor vehicle is employed." Patterson vs.  Southern Ry. Co., 198 S.E. 
364, 214 N.C. 38. 
<P> "The privilege of using the streets and highways by  the operation thereon 
of motor carriers for hire can be  acquired only by permission or license from 
the state or  its political subdivisions." Black's Law Dictionary,  6th Ed., 
p.920. 
<P> Under current law, the Congress continues to base its  definition of a motor 
vehicle on commercial use:  "'Motor vehicle' means every description of carriage 
 or other contrivance propelled or drawn by mechanical power  and USED FOR 
COMMERCIAL PURPOSES on the highways in the  transportation of passengers, 
passengers and property, or  property or cargo;" Title 18, U.S.C.  sec. 31.  
<P> In the beginning, courts across the country also recognized  that 
government's power to license under commerce was  limited to just that -- 
commerce: 
<P> "The right of a citizen to travel upon the public  highways and to transport 
his property thereon in the  ordinary course of life and business is a common 
right  which he has under his right to enjoy life and liberty, to  acquire and 
possess property, and to pursue happiness and  safety. It includes the right in 
so doing to use the  ordinary and usual conveyances of the day; and under the 
 existing modes of travel includes the right to drive a  horse-drawn carriage or 
wagon thereon, or to operate an  automobile thereon, for the usual and ordinary 
purposes of  life and business. It is not a mere privilege, like the  privilege 
of moving a house in the street, operating a  business stand in the street, or 
transporting persons or  property for hire along the street, which a city may 
permit  or prohibit at will." Thompson vs.  Smith, 154 S.E.  579 at 583. 
<P> "No statutory duty lies to apply for, or to possess a  driver license for 
personal travel and transportation as  defendant is not within the class of 
persons for whose  benefit or protection the statute was enacted." Routh  v.  
Quinn, 20 Cal 2d 488. 
<P> Courts also recognized that private travel is fundamental  right: "The right 
to travel on the public highways is  a constitutional right." Teche Lines v. 
Danforth,  Miss. 12 So 2d 784, 787.  
<P> "The right to travel is part of the 'liberty' that a  citizen cannot be 
deprived without due process of  law." Kent v.Dulles 357 U.S. 116; U.S. v. Laub 
385  U.S. 475  
<P> "The use of the highways for the purpose of travel and  transportation is 
not a mere privilege, but a common and  fundamental Right of which the public 
and the individual  cannot be rightfully deprived." Chicago Motor Coach  vs.  
Chicago, 169 NE 22; Ligare vs. Chicago, 28 NE 934;  Boon vs. Clark, 214 SSW 607; 
25 Am.Jur. (1st) Highways  Sect.163.  
<P> "Operation of a motor vehicle upon public streets and  highways is not a 
mere privilege but is a right or liberty  protected by the guarantees of Federal 
and State  constitutions." Adams v. City of Pocatello 416 P2d 46.  
<P> "The right of a citizen to travel upon the public  highways and to transport 
his property thereon, by  horse-drawn carriage, wagon, or automobile is not a 
mere  privilege which may be permitted or prohibited at will, but  a common 
right which he has under his right to life,  liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness." Slusher v.  Safety Coach Transit Co., 229 Ky 731, 17 SW2d 1012.  
<P> "The claim and exercise of a constitutional Right  cannot be converted into 
a crime." Miller vs. U.S.,  230 F. 486, 489.  
<P> "The right to travel is part of the 'liberty' of which  a citizen cannot be 
deprived without due process of law  under the Fifth Amendment." Kent v.  
Dulles, 357 U.S.  116 (1958). 
<P> "Where activities or enjoyment, natural and often  necessary to the well 
being of an American citizen, such as  travel, are involved, we will construe 
narrowly all  delegated powers that curtail or dilute them ... to repeat,  we 
deal here with a constitutional right of the  citizen," Edwards v.  California, 
314 U.S. 160 (1941). 
<P> The socialists tried early on to step beyond their limits  of regulating 
commercial travel. This conversion of the  citizen's rights through a compelled 
licensing scheme was  initially stopped by the courts:  "Where a private 
 statute exists of which the intent is regulation of  commercial common 
carriers, the particular agency enforcing  that private statute, shall not apply 
it by trickery and  deceit, to persons who are not noticed by the statute as 
 persons regulated and taxed, nor should it permit any party  to do so in 
violation of a person's right to stay out of  compelled license/contract, when 
he is not a person subject  to the statute, unless clearly within its words." 
 State v. Ebershart, 179 P 853, 246 P 2d 1011.  
<P> In time, however, the courts would join the socialist cause  and ignore 
their previous rulings like this one.  
<P> If courts all the way to the Supreme Court have ruled that  "the right of a 
citizen to travel upon the public  highways" is a "constitutional right,"  "not 
a mere privilege which may be permitted or  prohibited at will,"  and "no 
statutory duty lies  to apply for, or to possess a driver license for personal 
 travel" and such a right is "protected by the  guarantees of the Federal and 
State constitutions"  which "cannot be converted into a crime," then  why do you 
need a license to drive your private car on our  public highway? 
<P> It's simple. Socialists get elected to the legislature. Car  wrecks, school 
shootings, bombed federal buildings,  environmental degradation, the poor, the 
sick, the tired  and hungry, give many a cause to the  "there-ought-to-be-a-law" 
mentality of our  socialist saviors. Using the "problem" of the day  as the 
cause for their mission, they unshackle themselves  from their constitutional 
constraints and legislate, piece  by piece, the legal strait-jacket which 
confines the  liberties of the formerly free citizenry.   
<P> And the media beats the drum while socialists in the  legislature pipe the 
tune.  
<P> There are many subjects in the Constitution which the  legislature is 
authorized, and in some cases, even required  to legislate on. The subjects they 
are authorized to  legislate on are enumerated in the Constitution to keep the 
 legislature from making laws on any subject it wishes to  meddle in.  Even 
though the constitution has been amended  more than a hundred times for other 
purposes, there is no  provision in the Idaho Constitution allowing the state to 
 license drivers for operating a private automobile.  However, the legislature 
routinely ignores the  Constitution. An ambigious law was passed compelling the 
 citizenry to "purchase" a license before being  permitted to use the public 
highways. 
<P> Our modern day courts act in lockstep with these socialist  edicts and 
ignore constitutional facts and higher court  rulings.  
<P> How do I know? I attempted to prove I was innocent of  driving without 
"privileges" because the law said  I had a right to travel and only commercial 
travel could be  licensed. I was threatened with shackles and jail for 
 mentioning such laws, like the rulings above, to a jury.  The same jury that 
was not allowed to see such laws, then  found me "guilty" when I failed "to 
possess  a drivers license for personal travel."  
<P> The right of citizens to travel upon the public highways  which is 
"protected by the guarantees of the Federal  and State constitutions" have been 
"converted  into a crime." My attempt to defend myself by  mentioning the law 
also became a crime. And it all began  with commerce. 
<P> Truth and law are denied whenever they threaten the vines  of socialism. The 
drivers license has become a  multi-million dollar industry of government and a 
primary  mechanism by which our masters in government control our  movement and 
identify their property -- the citizen. Such  vested interests cannot be 
disturbed with law in this great  age of socialism.  The faithful believers in 
this ever  burgeoning socialism continue to look only at the vines and  leaves 
of the parasitical facade.  
<P> Placated by plentiful possessions, we look no further. Our  rights begin to 
dissolve when we fail to demand them. They  recede when our children are taught 
that only privileges  exist. When those children become adults the privileges of 
 socialism become the new law and all rights are gone.  Beginning with the 
authority to regulate commerce, our  "right" to travel has been converted 
 incrementally, over generations, to a  "privilege." 
<P> The gun 
<P> So what's the connection between the car and the gun? Most  people believe 
that everyone needs a license to drive a  car. Many would think you're nuts for 
the preposterous  notion that you have a right to travel without being 
 licensed. Show them the law and they will still think  you're nuts. They would 
rather believe in that which feeds  them. By providing the faithful with a sense 
of security  and giving comfort to those in need, the socialists have  created 
quite a following. 
<P> The control of the automobile began in the early 1900s.  Many generations 
later these unconstitutional license laws  have found favor with the converts to 
the socialist  democracy.  
<P> Gun control is a much more recent invention. In 1967 a  14-year-old boy 
could order a rifle and ammunition from the  Sears catalog and then pick it up 
at the Post Office. Then  came the Gun Control Act of 1968. An adult citizen 
could no  longer mail a gun. Neither could they cross state lines and  purchase 
a gun without having it shipped to someone in  their state who held a "Federal 
Firearms  License."  
<P> And how did Congress assume the authority to control guns  and license gun 
dealers? The "Commerce Clause" of  the Constitution. "The... power... to 
regulate  commerce... among the several states..." has become  the basis for the 
federal infringement of the right to keep  and bear arms.  The vine of socialism 
isn't about to stop  here. Having sunk its roots into the Commerce Clause,  it 
 will grow to control all aspects of the gun. But only if we  fail to rip that 
weed off the wall that is our  Constitution.   
<P> In the wake of the 1968 Gun Control Act,  many more  entanglements have 
sprouted. Import bans on "assault  rifles." Taxes on ammunition. Limitations on 
magazine  capacity. Background checks. Waiting periods. All under the 
 socialists creed, "for the common good." Many  more infringements are promised 
as the vine of socialism  grows around the right to keep and bear arms. And it 
all  began with commerce. 
<P> Can you spell infringe? Then look it up in the dictionary.  Will you allow 
the belief in the socialists cause to  prevail, or demand your rights under the 
Constitution? For  want of actually looking, all most people will ever see is 
 the leaves on the vines of socialism. Seeing is believing,  so they say, and 
the faithful converts to socialism  continue to believe in that untended weed 
which is choking  the foundations of our country. Our rights are fading like  a 
sunset turning into darkness.   
<P> Look back on the history of how the "right" to  travel was converted into a 
"privilege." Can we  prevent that history from repeating itself on our right to 
 keep and bear arms? Will you allow your children to believe  they must have 
permission from the government to own a gun?  
<P> Whether or not this generation takes a stand will determine  what rights are 
left for all future generations. Get out  your pruning shears and cut back the 
vines of socialism.  With thousands hacking at the roots, the entanglements 
 choking out our liberty can be removed from the wall of our  Constitution.  
Yes, the car and the gun are dangerous  contrivances which require competency 
and responsibility in  their operation, but so is the legislature.  Pre-emptive 
 laws deprive liberty. Is it government's purpose to control  everyone's conduct 
or to provide a remedy for misconduct?  What is more dangerous, the automobile 
and the gun, or the  legislature with the sword of commerce in its hands? 
<P> "The individual may stand upon his constitutional  rights as a Citizen. He 
is entitled to carry on his private  business in his own way. His power to 
contract is  unlimited. He owes no duty to the state or to his neighbors  to 
divulge his business, or to open his door to an  investigation, so far as it may 
tend to incriminate him. He  owes no such duty to the state, since he receives 
nothing  therefrom, beyond the protection of his life and property.   His rights 
are such as existed by the law of the land long  antecedent to the organization 
of the state. ...He owes  nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass 
upon  their rights." Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43 (1905)
