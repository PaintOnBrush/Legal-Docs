      size=5>To understand "Acceptance for Value" you must first understand 
      contracts. For this purpose we will stick with the basics. There are two 
      types of contracts:&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG>Simple</STRONG> and 
      <STRONG>Adhesion</STRONG>.<BR><BR>
      <CENTER>SIMPLE CONTRACTS<BR></CENTER><BR>A <STRONG>simple</STRONG> 
      contract is one in which two parties negotiate an agreement. It is 
      bilateral in that each party gives up something and gets something of 
      equal value in return. It normally is purely up to the parties' discretion 
      as to what the value is. If a dispute develops over the interpretation of 
      the contract, the courts will weigh the evidence, and whichever way the 
      scale tips (however small the tip), then the heavier side wins the 
      game.<BR><BR>
      <CENTER>ADHESION CONTRACTS</CENTER><BR>An <STRONG>adhesion</STRONG> 
      contract is also bilateral, but it is offered on a "take it or leave it" 
      basis, with no opportunity for negotiating the terms. Insurance and lease 
      contracts are good examples of adhesion contracts. To protect the offeror, 
      every detail of the contract must be specified. If a dispute develops over 
      the interpretation of the contract, the courts will decide all points in 
      the contract in favor of the offeror, and will decide all points not 
      covered in the contract to be in favor of the offeree.<BR><BR>Let's say 
      that you hire someone to paint your house. You have specified that it will 
      be painted yellow, that the job will be finished in three days, and that 
      the painter will notify you when it is done. The specifications are not 
      negotiated because you offered to the painter the contract on a 
      take-it-or-leave-it basis.<BR><BR>The painter accepts the contract and 
      paints the house exactly as specified, within three days, and notifies you 
      that it is finished as specified.<BR><BR>Then...he presents his bill. It 
      is for 3 times as much as you were expecting. You decide to go to 
      court.<BR><BR>The court looks as the contract and notes that the adhesion 
      contract was completed according to specification, but has nothing in it 
      about the value. Because you, the offeror, failed to specify the value, 
      the value decision must be in favor of the painter, no matter what is 
      fair. The painter accepted your contract for the value he perceived, and 
      you pay.<BR><BR>If the contract has been a negotiated contract instead of 
      an adhesion contract, the court would have listened to both sides equally, 
      then make a decision as to what would have been a fair value to 
      pay.<BR><BR>
      <CENTER>TRAFFIC TICKETS ARE ADHESION CONTRACTS</CENTER><BR>When a traffic 
      ticket is offered by the State through its officer, it is an adhesion 
      contract offered on a take-it-you-can't-leave-it basis. The terms are 
      specified and you have no opportunity to negotiate: You must perform to 
      their specification and satisfaction.<BR><BR>That's their side of the 
      deal. Lucky for you, in their enthusiasm to specify what you must do and 
      give up, they failed to specify what they must give up (i.e. pay) for the 
      privilege of commandeering your life. You accept their offer for the value 
      that it has, and you now specify that value because they failed to specify 
      it in their adhesion contract.<BR><BR>
      <CENTER>EVERY CONTRACT HAS TWO SIDES</CENTER><BR>When you accept the 
      contract for value, both sides must fulfill their obligations. In the case 
      of a traffic ticket, you MUST pay the fine, get a driver's license, fix 
      the license plate, or whatever it calls for. On the other hand, the State 
      must pay you the value you placed on the ticket, whatever that value may 
      be. Failure by either side to perform its obligation constitutes an 
      actionable breach of contract.<BR><BR>See <A

      for Value Mean?</A> for a more technical explanation based on UCC and
