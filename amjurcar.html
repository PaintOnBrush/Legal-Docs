<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">While there are many definitions of the
term "automobile," 1&nbsp; the courts have taken the commonly
understood meaning of the term. 2&nbsp; Basically, an automobile is a
self-propelled vehicle which does not run upon fixed rails or tracks.
3&nbsp;&nbsp; Some definitions add the further requirement that the
vehicle be designed for carrying persons or property on a highway.
4&nbsp;&nbsp; A further defining feature has been the number of wheels,
it being said that to the average person and to the public mind it is
common knowledge that the word "automobile" indicates a motor-driven
vehicle mounted on four wheels, 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as distinguished
from one mounted on two or three wheels, such as a motorcycle or a
bicycle. 6&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Footnote 1. For the purposes of federal
statutory provisions concerning the disclosure of automobile
information, the term "automobile" is defined to include any passenger
car or station wagon.&nbsp; 15 USCA &sect;&nbsp; 1231(c).<br>
<br>
For purposes of federal statutory provisions dealing with automobile
fuel economy, an automobile is defined as a four wheeled vehicle that
is propelled by fuel or by alternative fuel, manufactured primarily for
use on public streets, roads and highways, except a vehicle operated
only on a rail line, within certain weight limits.&nbsp; 49 USCA

[7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"Motor vehicle" is a broad term that
has no universally accepted meaning. 7&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been
considered to be much broader than the word "automobile," and to
include various vehicles which cannot be classified as automobiles.
8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Generally, a motor vehicle must be self-propelled
9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and must not operate on tracks or
rails. 10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some jurisdictions exclude vehicles
powered by human or animal power. 11 &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The term motor vehicle necessarily excludes trains 12&nbsp; or subways,
13&nbsp;&nbsp; but may either include 14&nbsp;&nbsp; or exclude
trackless trolleys. 15&nbsp;&nbsp; And most jurisdictions limit the
meaning of the phrase "motor vehicles" to transportation on land, not
water 16&nbsp; or air, 17&nbsp; although it has been held that a
motorboat is a motor vehicle within the meaning of federal bankruptcy
law. 18 <br>
<br>
Some jurisdictions have a requirement that a vehicle, in order to be
deemed a "motor vehicle," must have been designed for use upon a
highway, 19&nbsp; or be commonly or generally used to transport persons
and property over the public highways. 20 <br>
<br>
The term motor vehicle has been held to include a bus, 21&nbsp;&nbsp; a
utility van, 22&nbsp; a go-cart constructed of metal tubing, powered by
a lawnmower-type engine, 23&nbsp;&nbsp; and a motor-driven sprinkler
truck. 24 <br>
<br>
A golf cart may be considered a motor vehicle if it is operated on the
highways, 25&nbsp; but not when it is driven on a golf course. 26 <br>

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The operation of a motor vehicle upon
the public highways is not a fundamental right, but only a privilege
68&nbsp;&nbsp; which the state may grant or withhold at pleasure in the
course of its regulation and control of public ways. 69 &nbsp;<br>
<br>
&#776; Observation: Because the right to operate a motor vehicle is not a
fundamental one, the state must show only a legitimate interest, rather
than a compelling interest, to restrict or regulate the right. 70 <br>
<br>
Owners and operators of motor vehicles have the right to use the public
highways on an equal footing with the owners and operators of other
vehicles, 71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except as legislative restrictions have
been imposed in reference to the size or other features of such
vehicles. 72 &nbsp;<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">In the absence of a statute or

upon any portion of a public highway or street at any time of the day

operating a vehicle thereon are mutual, reciprocal, and equal.
79&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither may use the public way in disregard of the right
of the other to use it, and each must accommodate his or her movements
to the other's lawful use of it; each must anticipate the other's
possible presence, and each must recognize the dangers inherent in the
manner in which it may lawfully be used by the other. 80&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, in many jurisdictions statutes or ordinances have been enacted
which somewhat restrict the use of highways and streets by pedestrians,

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">It is well settled that the use of
highways and streets by vehicular or pedestrian traffic may be limited,
controlled, and regulated by the responsible public authority in the
exercise of the police power whenever, and to the extent, necessary to
provide for and promote the safety, peace, health, morals, and general
welfare of the people. 83&nbsp; Use of public highways and streets is
subject to such reasonable and impartial regulations adopted pursuant
to the police power as are calculated to secure to the general public
the largest practical benefit from the enjoyment of the right of use,
84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to provide for their safety while they
are upon such public ways in the enjoyment of such right. 85&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The use of the highways and streets by vehicular or pedestrian traffic
is subject to reasonable regulation by the state under the police power
with which it is vested, 86&nbsp;&nbsp; and by municipalities
87&nbsp;&nbsp; and by administrative bodies or officials 88&nbsp;&nbsp;
acting under a delegation of such power to them by the state.&nbsp;
Moreover, such use of highways and streets is subject to regulation by
the federal government within the limits of the power granted to it by
the Constitution of the United States. 89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
the power to regulate vehicles and their use of the public ways may not
be used indirectly to control and regulate the business of the user.
90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor will the regulation and control of the use of
highways and streets by vehicular or pedestrian traffic be assumed by
the courts, since such matters involve the exercise of legislative and
administrative functions. 91 &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Subsequent subdivisions of this article contain a discussion of
particular subjects of automotive regulation, including the licensing
of vehicles and drivers, 92&nbsp;&nbsp; equipment, weight, and size
regulations, 93&nbsp;&nbsp; and traffic regulations. 94 &nbsp;<br>

Who May Regulate Motor Vehicles [16-23]</span><br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&sect; 16&nbsp; Federal regulation</span>&nbsp;
[7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The power of the federal government to
regulate interstate commerce 1&nbsp;&nbsp; gives it control over motor
vehicles engaged in business between one state and another in the same
degree as such control exists as to any other class of vehicles engaged
in the same occupation. 2&nbsp; Examples of such federal regulation
include the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, whose purpose is to reduce
traffic accidents and deaths and injuries from traffic accidents by
prescribing motor vehicle safety standards for motor vehicles and
equipment in interstate commerce, and by undertaking and supporting
necessary safety research and development; 3&nbsp;&nbsp; the Highway
Safety Act of 1966, which establishes various programs, such as alcohol
awareness programs, to increase highway safety; 4&nbsp;&nbsp; the
National Driver Registry Act, which establishes a central national
clearinghouse for information on drivers; 5&nbsp;&nbsp; the National
Motor Vehicle Title Information System, which establishes a national
clearinghouse of information on motor vehicle titles; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;
statutes requiring state participation in an international registration
plan and an international fuel tax agreement; 7&nbsp;&nbsp; the Motor
Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act; 8&nbsp;&nbsp; the Theft Prevention
Act; 9&nbsp;&nbsp; the Consumer Information Act, which requires the
Secretary of Transportation to collect and disseminate information on
vehicle safety, crash worthiness, repair costs, operating costs and
insurance costs; 10&nbsp; and the Consumer Product Safety Act, whose
purposes are to protect the public against unreasonable risks of
injury, to assist consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of
consumer products, to develop uniform safety standards, to minimize
conflicting state and local regulations, and to promote research and
investigation into the causes and prevention of product-related deaths,
illness, and injuries, all with respect to consumer products including
motor vehicles. 11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also statutes for:&nbsp;
establishing a conference on advanced automotive technologies in order
to explore new technologies to improve the competitiveness of the
American automobile industry; 12&nbsp;&nbsp; providing a cash award and
medal for advances in motor vehicle research and development;
13&nbsp;&nbsp; establishing adult education programs to increase the
literacy of commercial drivers; 14&nbsp;&nbsp; and providing for the
withholding of apportionments to states that do not meet specified
requirements regarding the operation of motor vehicles by intoxicated
minors. 15 &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Congress, in the exercise of its power to regulate interstate commerce,
can require a municipality to permit interstate commerce by motor
vehicles to pass over its streets. 16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, Congress has no general power to enact police regulations
operative within the territorial limits of a state, and it generally
cannot take the power to enact such regulations from the states or
attempt any supervision over regulations of the states established
under the police power. 17&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fact that the federal
government contributes to the building of roads in a state, or
establishes a national park which encompasses a state highway, does not
take from the state the power to regulate the use of such roads.
18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if a subject comes within one of the
enumerated powers granted to the federal government by the Constitution
of the United States, Congress can legislate concerning the subject to
provide regulations similar to those enacted in the states under the
police power. 19 &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The regulation of motor carriers by the federal government pursuant to
the provisions of the Federal Motor Carrier Act, the Commercial Vehicle
Safety Act, 20&nbsp;&nbsp; and the Motor Carrier Safety Act
21&nbsp;&nbsp; is treated in another article. 22&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The federal government, through acts of Congress, may regulate and
control the operation of motor vehicles insofar as they are acting as
governmental agencies in performing governmental functions or duties.
23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, there are several
statutes regulating the use of government owned vehicles,
24&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring safety devices in government owned vehicles,
25&nbsp;&nbsp; and controlling expenses related to government owned
motor vehicles. 26 &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Congress has properly delegated to the commissioners of the District of
Columbia the power to regulate the movement of vehicles on the public
streets thereof. 27 <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">&sect; 17&nbsp; &#8211; Pre-emption of state
and local regulation</span>&nbsp; [7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY
TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The Motor Vehicle Safety Act
28&nbsp;&nbsp; does not generally pre-empt the field of regulation of
motor vehicle safety, 29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but it does pre-empt state
standards relating to the same subject that are either more or less
stringent than the federal standards. 30 Only state statutes that
conflict with federal safety standards are pre-empted. 31&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thus, pre-emption should only occur where compliance with both the
federal and local regulations is impossible. 32&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,
while a state may be pre-empted from establishing its own standards, it
is not pre-empted from enforcing the federal standards. 33&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thus, federal safety standards on motorcycle helmets do not pre-empt
state laws requiring motorcycle riders to wear helmets, 34&nbsp; but
the state cannot prescribe helmets that differ from those in the
federal regulations. 35&nbsp;&nbsp; State laws requiring proof of
compliance with federal standards before automobiles not originally
designed for the United States market may be licensed and registered
are also not pre-empted by the federal regulations.

[7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The use of public highways by motor
vehicles does not amount to an absolute and unqualified right, 37&nbsp;
but is subject to regulation and control by a state, not only because
they operate upon public property, 38&nbsp;&nbsp; but also under the
police power of the state, which it is the legislature's province to
exercise in appropriate circumstances. 39&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, state
legislatures, by virtue of their inherent police powers and plenary
jurisdiction over public ways, may enact reasonable regulations
governing the conduct of the owners and drivers of vehicles operated
thereon, 40&nbsp; and calculated to promote care on the part of highway
users, 41 which regulations may extend to nonresidents as well as
residents. 42&nbsp; And in regulating the use of public highways, the
state has traditionally been afforded exceptionally broad discretion.
43 <br>
<br>
In the exercise of its power to regulate and control the public
highways, a state legislature may prohibit the use on the highways of
such vehicles as are dangerous to the general traveling public.
44&nbsp;&nbsp; The legislature cannot, however, prevent citizens from
using the public highways in the ordinary manner, and the fact that the
vehicle used for the movement of persons or things along the highways
is novel will not justify its exclusion. 45 <br>
<br>
&#776; Observation: It has been held that state motor vehicle law may not
apply to motor vehicle traffic on private property. 46 <br>
<br>
The fact that the federal government contributes to or assists the
state in the building of highways does not take from or limit the power
of the state in the exercise of its police power or other right to
regulate and control the use of such highways by vehicular or other
traffic. 47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">&sect; 19&nbsp; Municipal or local
regulation</span>&nbsp; [7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The police power of the state to
regulate and control the use of its highways may be delegated to
municipalities for exercise by them in the interest of public safety
and the promotion of the general welfare. 48&nbsp;&nbsp; A municipality
to which the power to regulate the use of its streets has been
delegated by constitutional provision or legislative enactment may
adopt regulations governing the operation of motor vehicles within its
limits, provided such regulations are reasonable, 49&nbsp;&nbsp; and
are not in conflict with the principles of constitutional law
50&nbsp;&nbsp; or valid statutes governing the subject. 51&nbsp; But a
city may not attempt to regulate beyond its jurisdiction. 52 <br>
<br>
&#776; Observation: Any power delegated to cities to regulate traffic in
their jurisdiction is strictly construed. 53 <br>
<br>
The grant of authority to a local government to regulate traffic is not
exclusive and will not preclude state law. 54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Moreover, a state may withdraw its delegation of authority to a city to
regulate traffic. 55 <br>
<br>
By the enactment of a general law covering a specific phase of motor
vehicle regulation, the state may impliedly deprive local authorities
of the power to pass ordinances which would be inconsistent with such
law. 56&nbsp;&nbsp; However, simply because a state undertakes to
impose certain regulations applicable to the entire state, a
municipality is not necessarily deprived of the power of imposing other
regulations adapted to its own peculiar conditions, if these are not
inconsistent with those of a general character prescribed for the
entire state. 57&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, a state statute may expressly
give a city authority to regulate in a certain area and indicate that
the city's regulatory authority supersedes any inconsistent state law
provisions. 58&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
There is some support for the view that there is an implied grant of
police power to every municipality organized under the laws of a state,
unless the legislature has provided that municipal corporations shall
have only such powers as are expressly conferred upon them by statute.
59&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the latter provision is made, it must appear, in
order to find authority of a municipality to adopt an ordinance
regulating the use of automobiles, that a charter provision or statute
exists which is broad enough to cover the terms of the ordinance.

statutes</span>&nbsp; [7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Municipalities to which the power to
regulate the use of their public ways by motor vehicles has been
delegated by statute may enact such regulations so long as they are not
in conflict with or repugnant to state legislative enactments governing
the use of such vehicles; 64&nbsp;&nbsp; but such regulations are
invalid if they are in conflict with statutes relating to the subject.
65&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Where the state has retained the power to provide general laws
regulating traffic on the highways of the state, legislation enacted
pursuant to such right cannot be curtailed, infringed upon, or annulled
by local authorities, 66&nbsp; and where there is conflict between such
a state statute and a municipal ordinance, the statute prevails.
67&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rule applies even in a jurisdiction where the
municipality is granted the authority under the constitution to make
and enforce laws respecting municipal affairs, subject only to the
provisions of its charter, the regulation of traffic not being deemed a
"municipal affair" within the meaning of the constitutional grant of
authority. 68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, if the state
statute, fairly construed, does not purport to be exclusive of the
power of a municipality to make and enforce traffic regulations for the
municipality, the fact that the municipal regulations are more
stringent than the traffic regulations provided by statute does not
invalidate them. 69 <br>
<br>
Whether or not a local government may enact an ordinance at variance
with a state statute depends on whether the state intended to pre-empt
the field. 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, an ordinance should stand
unless there is an actual conflict between the ordinance and the
statute or unless the legislature has clearly pre-empted the field so
as to preclude any municipal actions. 71&nbsp;&nbsp; A conflict exists
when the local regulation is facially inconsistent with the state law,
72&nbsp; such as when the ordinance prohibits an act permitted by
statute or permits an act prohibited by statute. 73 <br>
<br>
The matter of conflict between state and local regulations is further
considered in reference to specific regulations discussed in subsequent
sections of the article.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">&sect; 22&nbsp; Regulation by public
officers and boards</span>&nbsp; [7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY
TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A statute or ordinance placing
discretionary power in an administrative agency must furnish standards
for those who administer such power. 74&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly,
legislative power to promulgate regulations governing motor vehicles
and traffic upon public ways cannot be delegated to administrative
officers or boards, to be exercised in their uncontrolled discretion.
75&nbsp;&nbsp; However, no unconstitutional delegation of legislative
power to regulate motor vehicles and traffic upon public ways is
involved in leaving it to the discretion of administrative officers or
boards to accomplish in detail what is authorized or required by the
law in general terms, so long as such discretion is limited with
clearly defined standards and policies to be implemented; 76&nbsp; and
there are many regulations respecting motor vehicles and traffic upon
public ways which may be prescribed or promulgated by a public officer
or board acting under powers granted by the legislature. 77&nbsp;
Courts will generally uphold provisions permitting public officers or
boards to determine conditions under which a law respecting motor
vehicles or traffic upon public ways may or may not apply or to alter
such regulations to meet peculiar local conditions.
78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The exercise of functions of a ministerial character in connection with
motor vehicle and traffic regulation may be delegated by the
legislature to the highway department, 79&nbsp; to a state department
of transportation, 80&nbsp; to the motor vehicle commissioner or
administration, 81&nbsp; to park commissioners, 82&nbsp; to police
boards, 83&nbsp;&nbsp; or to the such other public officers or boards
as it deems fit. 84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the extent that the
legislature has the power to delegate the power to perform an
administrative function to a board or commission, it has also the power
to revoke or change such delegation. 85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
local power to regulate cannot be taken away and conferred on another
authority without clear statutory expression. 86 <br>
<br>
The fact that there is no provision for an appeal from the action of
public authorities in promulgating regulations respecting motor
vehicles or traffic upon public ways does not necessarily render them
invalid. 87 &nbsp;<br>

[7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">There is some question as to the extent
to which the power to direct traffic upon the public ways may be
delegated to police officers. 88&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, an ordinance
which imposes upon police officers the duty of enforcing the provisions
of a traffic ordinance, but gives them the discretion to direct traffic
as public safety or convenience may demand in times of an emergency,
89&nbsp; or to expedite traffic or safeguard pedestrians, 90&nbsp; is
valid and constitutional, and is not open to the objection that it is
an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to police officers,
or that it deprives motorists of their liberty without due process of
law.&nbsp; Such an ordinance is upheld on the theory that the subject
is one which does not admit of rigid or fixed regulations which will
operate automatically and with entire impartiality without the
intervention of a directing intelligence. 91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some
instances, however, provisions conferring such power of direction have
been declared invalid upon the ground that they vested in the officer
an unnecessary discretion and power of discrimination. 92<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">&sect; 24&nbsp; Generally</span>&nbsp;
[7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">In common with other police
regulations, 93 statutes and ordinances regulating vehicles and their
use on the public highways and streets must be reasonable. 94&nbsp;
Moreover, the regulation must be reasonably related to a proper
legislative goal. 95&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Whether such a statute or ordinance is reasonable is to be determined
in view of the general conditions existing at the time the question
arises, 96&nbsp; and neither exact precision nor scientific calculation
is essential to render regulations of highway traffic reasonable.
97&nbsp; Such regulations may be reasonable notwithstanding that they
operate harshly against particular persons, 98&nbsp; and, generally
speaking, the burden of showing that they are unreasonable is on those
who deny their validity. 99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
&#776; Observation: Traffic ordinances are presumed to be valid.
1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Statutes and ordinances regulating vehicles and their use on the public
highways and streets must also be definite in specifying the conduct
which is condemned or prohibited, to the end that the persons concerned
may know how to comply with the requirements of the statutes.
2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In determining the validity of local traffic regulations, it is
necessary to balance the effect of the ordinance in promoting health,
safety and welfare of the community against the hardships and
difficulties it causes to individuals.&nbsp; An evidentiary hearing may
be required. 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in making such determinations, the
courts will take judicial notice of matters of common knowledge. 4

In action challenging the constitutionality of anticruising ordinances,
municipalities satisfactorily demonstrated that cruising ordinances
were not unconstitutionally broad, based on findings that cruising
ordinances were narrowly tailored to deal with unquestioned problems
associated with cruising, ordinances were limited in time to those
hours of day where cruising was shown to be problem, they were limited
to those streets where municipalities experienced cruising, they set
forth standards for cruising&#8211;three vehicular passes of control point

classification</span>&nbsp; [7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY
TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Statutes and ordinances regulating
vehicles and their operation upon the public ways must not unjustly
discriminate between individuals or classes. 5&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the
applicability of such laws may be limited in accordance with a
reasonable classification of persons, subjects, or places.
6&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, for safety purposes, users of the highways may
constitutionally be classified according to the character and extent of
their use, and, if so classified, may be subjected to regulation.
7&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, a classification having a basis in practical
convenience is not unconstitutional because it may be lacking in purely
theoretical or scientific uniformity.
8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because most traffic ordinances
do not create a suspect classification, 9&nbsp;&nbsp; the
classifications will be upheld so long as they bear a rational
relationship to a legitimate state purpose. 10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Motor vehicles have been recognized as properly and reasonably forming
a separate class of instrumentalities for legislative purposes.
11&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, a statute or ordinance is not
unconstitutional as being special legislation merely because it
legislates solely upon the question of the operation of automobiles,
and does not attempt to regulate the operation of all vehicles using
the public highways. 12&nbsp;&nbsp; Separate classifications for
motorcycles have been upheld in many circumstances, 13&nbsp; although
prohibitions of motorcycles on park roads have sometimes been struck
down as unconstitutional classifications. 14 <br>
<br>
Separate classification of snowmobiles has also been upheld. 15 <br>
<br>
Buses form a separate and distinct class of conveyance, and therefore
regulation of such vehicles is not discriminatory because streetcars,
taxicabs, and the like, are excluded from their operation.
16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So too, as a general rule, "jitneys" may be
subjected to different regulations than those applicable to privately
owned automobiles, 17&nbsp; although an ordinance prohibiting jitneys
has been held to be unconstitutional classification on the ground that
it bore no substantial relationship to traffic safety. 18 <br>
<br>
A distinction may also be made between private carriers who transport
their own property for compensation and those who transport their own
property without compensation.

to vehicles engaged in transportation for hire</span>&nbsp; [7A Am Jur
2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The use upon the public highways of
motor vehicles engaged in transportation for hire may be prohibited,
restricted, or conditioned by the controlling public authority.
20&nbsp; This rule applies to private contract carriers 21&nbsp; as
well as to common carriers. 22&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
With respect to the applicability of the constitutional prohibition
against unreasonable classifications, 23&nbsp;&nbsp; it has been
expressly recognized that buses form a separate and distinct class of
conveyance, and that therefore regulations pertaining to such vehicles
are not discriminatory because streetcars, taxicabs, and the like, are
excluded from their operation. 24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So too, as a
general rule, "jitneys" may be subjected to different regulations than
those applicable to privately owned automobiles, 25&nbsp; although an
ordinance prohibiting jitneys has been held to be unconstitutional
classification on the ground that it bore no substantial relationship
to traffic safety. 26&nbsp;&nbsp; A distinction may also be made
between private carriers who transport their own property for
compensation and those who transport their own property without
compensation. 27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Matters relating to the regulation of the business of transportation
for hire, such as requirements for special licenses or permits or
certificates of convenience and necessity, the regulation of rates and
charges, and the establishment of schedules and routes, are discussed
in other articles. 28&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&sect; 27&nbsp; Regulations affecting
interstate commerce</span>&nbsp; [7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY
TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">In the absence of an act of Congress
covering the subject, a state may impose upon vehicles using its
highways in interstate commerce nondiscriminatory regulations for the
purpose of insuring the public safety and convenience, and for the
protection and conservation of the use of such highways. 29&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even though a local regulation materially interferes with interstate
commerce, great leeway is allowed local authorities where traffic
control and the use of highways are involved and where there is no
conflicting federal regulation. 30&nbsp; For example, state
legislatures have great leeway in providing safety regulations for all
vehicles, interstate as well as local, 31&nbsp; such measures carrying
a strong presumption of validity when challenged in the courts.
32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
If a statute is neutral on its face, has only indirect or incidental
effects on interstate commerce, and regulates evenhandedly, the statute
will be upheld unless the burden on such commerce is clearly excessive
in relation to the putative local benefits. 33&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, a
state highway safety measure affecting interstate commerce will, absent
federal entry into the field, be upheld, unless from the whole record
it can be concluded that the total effect of the state law furthers the
purpose of safety so marginally and interferes with commerce so
substantially that it must be invalid. 34&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Taken into consideration with other factors, the cost involved in
complying with state regulations applicable to interstate commerce may
be relevant to the issue of a burden on commerce. 35&nbsp; However,
even though a state which adopts a safety measure requiring a motor
carrier design which is out of line with the requirements of almost all
other states may sometimes place a great burden of delay and
inconvenience on those interstate motor carriers entering or crossing
its territory, such a new safety measure may be so compelling that the
innovating state need not be the one to give way. 36&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
A statute which clearly discriminates against interstate commerce is
unconstitutional unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by
a valid factor unrelated to economic protection. 37&nbsp; Thus, state
regulations of motor vehicles engaged in transportation for hire which
unreasonably interfere with or discriminate against interstate commerce
are invalid. 38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a state goes beyond the
regulation of the manner of use of highways, and purports to determine
the persons by whom an interstate highway may be used, its regulation
may be attacked successfully on the ground of an imposition of a burden
on interstate commerce. 39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the
reasonableness of regulations as applied to motor vehicles must be
judged with a proper regard to the safety and convenience of the
public, in view of local conditions, on the one hand, and the
necessities of those engaged in interstate transportation, on the
other. 40&nbsp;&nbsp; Such regulations, although they may entail some
degree of inconvenience or interference, will not be regarded as a
direct and unlawful burden upon interstate commerce. 41&nbsp; On the
other hand, in exercising its power to regulate the use of highways by
motor vehicles moving in interstate commerce, one state cannot
establish standards which would derogate from the equal power of other
states to make regulations of their own. 42&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Municipalities retain considerable authority to regulate how motor
vehicles engaged in interstate commerce shall be operated over their
streets, 43&nbsp;&nbsp; and may require that such vehicles obey traffic
and other general safety regulations. 44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Title to, or ownership of, a motor
vehicle may be evidenced by possession of a bill of sale,
45&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate of title, 46&nbsp;&nbsp; or certificate of
registration, 47&nbsp;&nbsp; relating to such vehicle, although such
documents do not ordinarily establish conclusively the ownership of
such a vehicle, but are merely prima facie evidence thereof.
48&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the mere fact that one has possession of a
motor vehicle is not conclusive evidence of ownership and of the right
of disposal, 49&nbsp; although a rebuttable presumption of ownership is
created thereby. 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of ownership is one
of fact to be decided by the factfinder. 51 &nbsp;<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">&sect; 29&nbsp; Certificates of title</span>&nbsp;
[7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">In many states the statutes provide a
system of registering the title to motor vehicles not unlike the
Torrens system of registering title to real property. 52&nbsp;&nbsp;
Such statutes constitute an authorized exercise of the police power on
the part of the legislature, and do not violate any of the provisions
of the Federal Constitution. 53&nbsp;&nbsp; The provisions of such
statutes vary between jurisdictions, but they have in common an
arrangement for the issuance of a certificate of title or similar
instrument which, it is intended, shall show who is the owner of the
vehicle. 54&nbsp;&nbsp; Such statutes are to be interpreted in
accordance with the general purpose sought to be effectuated by them,
55&nbsp; which is to afford the public a means of proper determination
of ownership and encumbrance of motor vehicles and to protect innocent
purchasers 56&nbsp; and the public against fraud and imposition in
transactions involving the titles of motor vehicles, and to discourage
larceny and unlawful disposition of such vehicles. 57 &nbsp;<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&#776; Observation: Such statutes have no
extraterritorial effect. 58 <br>
<br>
The effect of a certificate of title as proof of the title to, or
ownership of, a motor vehicle depends upon the terms of the statute
involved and the construction thereof in the particular
jurisdiction.&nbsp; In most jurisdictions, in accordance with the
applicable statute, the certificate of title is considered to be only
prima facie evidence of ownership. 59&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not the
exclusive method of proving ownership, 60&nbsp; nor does it necessarily
provide conclusive evidence of ownership; 61&nbsp;&nbsp; it merely
provides some evidence of ownership. 62&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In many jurisdictions, a certificate of title is presumptive evidence
of ownership. 63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some jurisdictions this
presumption may only be rebutted by evidence of fraud, coercion, theft,
forgery, or misrepresentation. 64&nbsp;&nbsp; Other jurisdictions
require clear and convincing proof of actual ownership in order to
rebut the presumption of ownership created by the certificate of title.
65&nbsp;&nbsp; Many jurisdictions find that the presumption may be
rebutted by competent evidence of actual ownership 66&nbsp;&nbsp;
arising from the particular facts and circumstances of the case.
67&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it has been held in some jurisdictions that
where a person has both possession of the automobile and a certificate
of title in his or her name there is irrebuttable evidence of
ownership. 68 <br>
<br>
&#776; Observation: In an action to recover for damages to a motor vehicle,
a certificate of title may be the only acceptable proof of title to the
damaged vehicle under the terms of the statute in a particular
jurisdiction. 69&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not mean however that the
parties may not stipulate as to the ownership of the motor vehicle,
rendering proof unnecessary. 70 <br>
<br>
One who purchases a motor vehicle and has the certificate of title
issued in the name of another, and who wishes to establish a resulting
trust, has the burden of establishing such trust by clear, convincing,
and satisfactory evidence. 71&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the statute provides
that evidence is not admissible to dispute the title of one to whom a
certificate of title to a motor vehicle has been issued pursuant to
statute, except evidence to establish fraud which would cause such
certificate to be voidable, a resulting trust with respect to a motor
vehicle cannot be created in the absence of proof of fraud. 72 <br>

HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A number of jurisdictions have
recognized that, since statutes relating to the registration of motor
vehicles are police or revenue measures, 74&nbsp;&nbsp; neither
compliance nor noncompliance with their terms, although persuasive, is
conclusive of the question of title. 75&nbsp; It is sometimes stated,
in this regard, that the registration of a motor vehicle creates a
presumption or prima facie showing of ownership of a motor vehicle in
the party in whose name the vehicle is registered, 76&nbsp; and that
the presence of one's license plates upon a motor vehicle creates a
presumption or prima facie showing that he or she is the owner of the
vehicle. 77&nbsp;&nbsp; And although there is some authority for the
contrary view, 78&nbsp; the presumptions arising from facts related to
registration or licensing of a motor vehicle are generally not deemed
conclusive but are considered to be rebuttable by the introduction of
evidence to the contrary, 79&nbsp; which evidence must be undisputed,
clear, and convincing. 80&nbsp;&nbsp; When there is competent and
sufficient rebuttal evidence, ownership becomes a question of fact for
the jury. 81&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">In some jurisdictions statutes have
been enacted which require the execution of bills of sale in connection
with the sale or transfer of motor vehicles. 82&nbsp;&nbsp; Since such
statutes are police measures and regulatory in character, 83&nbsp;
neither compliance nor noncompliance with their terms, although
persuasive, 84&nbsp; is regarded as conclusive of the question of
title. 85&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Where there is no statutory requirement that a bill of sale be executed
in connection with the transfer of title to a motor vehicle, the
absence of a bill of sale does not constitute evidence of nonownership.

[7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This discussion is concerned primarily
with provisions of law which relate solely to the sale, transfer, or
encumbrance of motor vehicles as distinguished from those provisions of
law which relate to the sale, transfer, or encumbrance of personal
property generally. 87&nbsp; Also discussed elsewhere are the liens of
garagemen and others for repairs 88&nbsp;&nbsp; and accessions to motor
vehicles. 89 &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The sale of motor vehicles is a lawful business which any person has a
right to pursue, subject only to reasonable regulation.
90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The regulation of the business of selling motor
vehicles, under the state police power, for the purpose of preventing
fraud and promoting the general welfare of the public, is a proper
subject for legislative action. 91&nbsp; In adopting such regulations,
the legislature may properly differentiate between dealers in new
vehicles and dealers in used vehicles. 92&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to such
power, the legislature may adopt regulations imposing license fees and
taxes upon persons in the business of selling motor vehicles,
93&nbsp;&nbsp; and may regulate the sales prices of motor vehicles.
94&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Inasmuch as a contract of purchase and sale, or the encumbrance, of a
motor vehicle is not ordinarily different from a contract relating to
any other kind of personal property, any statute which limits or
prescribes a different form of contract, or a different procedure, is
in derogation of common right and of the freedom of contract, and for
that reason the statute is subject to the rule of strict construction.

certificates of title</span>&nbsp; [7A Am Jur 2d AUTOMOBILES AND
HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">In many jurisdictions where provision
is made for the issuance of certificates of title to motor vehicles,
96&nbsp;&nbsp; the sale or transfer of a motor vehicle is consummated
by the assignment of the certificate of title to the purchaser or
transferee in the method prescribed by statute. 97&nbsp; In most of
these jurisdictions such statutory provisions are viewed as merely
police measures, regulatory in character, and are not meant to
establish an exclusive method of transfer of title to a motor vehicle.
98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other jurisdictions, however, the
statutory provisions as to the assignment of the certificate of title
to a motor vehicle upon the sale or transfer of the vehicle are viewed
as absolute and mandatory and are rigidly enforced by the courts, and
title does not pass without adherence to such provisions.
99&nbsp;&nbsp; In such jurisdictions the assignment of the certificate
of title in the manner provided by the statute is the exclusive and
only method of transferring title to a motor vehicle, whether the
transfer is made by the owner by way of sale or gift or is effected by
operation of law. 1 <br>

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Statutes in a number of states provide
that it is illegal for any person to operate a motor vehicle on state's
roads or highways unless the vehicle is registered. 97&nbsp; These
statutes also provide for certain penalties for failure to register,
such as police impoundment of vehicles that are improperly registered.
98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Violation of motor vehicle registration statutes
may also have other consequences.&nbsp; For example, where a statute
requires a vehicle seller to forward applications for registration of
certificates of title to the county treasurer within a certain time
after the vehicle is sold, failure to forward those documents
constitutes negligence per se. 99 <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">&sect; 71&nbsp; Nature of license fee
or tax; distinction from property tax</span>&nbsp; [7A Am Jur 2d
AUTOMOBILES AND HIGHWAY TRAFFIC]<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Although motor vehicles may be taxed as
property, 86&nbsp;&nbsp; the charge made in connection with the
licensing and registration of motor vehicles is generally deemed to be
a license fee or tax for the privilege of using the public highways,
rather than a property tax, even where it is based on the vehicle's
value, 87&nbsp; or where the fees go into a general fund, but are
earmarked for use to maintain and improve local roads. 88&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because they are not property taxes, such charges are not affected by
constitutional provisions governing ad valorem taxes.
89&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The charge is designated as an excise, 90&nbsp; a
license, 91&nbsp; or a privilege 92&nbsp; tax or fee, or as a service
charge. 93&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a tax or fee has sometimes been said to be
in the nature of a toll for using the highways. 94&nbsp;&nbsp; In some
instances, the provisions of particular statutes imposing a charge in
connection with the licensing or registration of motor vehicles have
been held to impose a property tax, 95&nbsp;&nbsp; or a combination
privilege 96&nbsp; or license 97&nbsp;&nbsp; and property tax.<br>
<br>
While the intent of the legislature as to whether a fee exacted in
connection with the licensing or registration of a motor vehicle
constitutes an exercise of the state's police power or the state's
taxation power is not absolutely controlling, 98&nbsp;&nbsp; it is an
important factor in determining the nature of the fee.
99&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, for example, where the legislation creating
a charge assessed for the privilege of operating overweight or over
dimensional vehicles on state highways designates the charge as a
license fee, it has been considered to be a license fee, which cannot
be excessive in relation to the cost of administering the permit
program, rather than a tax. 1 &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The police power, rather than the taxing power, is exercised in
licensing the use of vehicles where the primary purpose is to regulate
or restrict their use; and this is true even though some revenue arises
from the fees collected, and although such revenue is applied to the
repair of the streets. 2&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that revenue is
incidentally derived from the license or registration fee does not
invalidate a law as a police regulation if the revenue is not so
disproportionate as to make the fee charged unreasonable. 3&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, if the fee exacted exceeds the amount necessary for the
administration of the law, it is an exercise of the power of taxation,
or, to express it in other words, a revenue measure. 4 &nbsp;<br>
<br>
&#776; Observation: Even requirements imposed primarily under the police
power may have the secondary purpose of raising revenue. 5&nbsp; In
other words, the police power and the taxing power may be exercised
jointly in the enactment of a valid licensing statute. 6&nbsp; <br>
