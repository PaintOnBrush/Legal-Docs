      <P><FONT size=-1 face=Verdana,Arial,Helvetica>Story,</FONT> Circuit 
      Justice. This is a libel brought in the district court upon a policy of 
      insurance, alleging it to be a maritime contract, of which that court, as 
      a court of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, has cognizance. There is a 
      plea to the jurisdiction, and the present question rests solely on the 
      general sufficiency of that plea as a declinatory bar. It has been argued, 
      and now stands for judgment. I shall make no apology for the length of 
      this opinion. The vast importance and novelty of the questions, which are 
      involved in this suit, render it impossible to come to a correct decision 
      without a thorough examination of the whole jurisdiction of the admiralty. 
      I shall, therefore, consider, in the first place, what is the true nature 
      and extent of the ancient jurisdiction of the admiralty; in the next 
      place, how far it has been abridged or altered by statutes, or by common 
      law decisions; and in the last place, what causes are included in the 
      delegation by the constitution to the judicial power of the United States 
      of "all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction."</P>
      <P align=center>. . . . .</P>
      <P>On the whole, the result of this examination may be summed up in the 
      following propositions. 1. That the jurisdiction of the admiralty, until 
      the statutes of Richard II., extended to all maritime contracts, whether 
      executed at home or abroad, and to all torts, injuries, and offences, on 
      the high seas, and in ports, and havens, as far as the ebb and flow of the 
      tide. 2. That the common law interpretation of these statutes abridges 
      this jurisdiction to things wholly and exclusively done upon the sea. 3. 
      That this interpretation is indefensible, upon principle, and the 
      decisions founded upon it are inconsistent and contradictory. 4. That the 
      interpretation of the same statutes by the admiralty does not abridge any 
      of its ancient jurisdiction, but leaves to it cognizance of all maritime 
      contracts, and all torts, injuries and offences, upon the high sea, and in 
      ports as far the tide ebbs and flows. 5. That this is the true limit, 
      which upon principle would seem to belong to the admiralty; that it is 
      consistent with the language and intent of the statutes; and is supported 
      by analogous reasoning, and public convenience, and a very considerable 
      weight of<!--[Volume 4, Page 302]--> authority. 6. That under all the 
      circumstances, the courts of law and of admiralty in England are not so 
      tied down by a uniformity of decisions, that they are not at liberty to 
      entertain the question anew, and to settle the doctrines upon their true 
      principles; and that this opinion is supported by some of the best 
      elementary writers in that kingdom.</P>
      <P>But whatever may in England be the binding authority of the common law 
      decisions upon this subject, in the United States we are at liberty to 
      re-examine the doctrines, and to construe the jurisdiction of the 
      admiralty upon enlarged and liberal principles. The constitution has 
      delegated to the judicial power of the United States cognizance "of all 
      cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;" and the act of congress 
      (Sept. 24, 1789, c. 20, § 9) has given to the district court "cognizance 
      of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, including all 
      seizures under laws of impost, navigation or trade, of the United States, 
      where the seizures are made on waters navigable from the sea by vessels of 
      ten or more tons burthen; with their respective districts, as well as upon 
      the high seas."</P>
      <P>What is the true interpretation of the clause "all cases of admiralty 
      and maritime jurisdiction?" If we examine the etymology, or received use, 
      of the words "admiralty" and "maritime jurisdiction," we shall find, that 
      they include jurisdiction of all things done upon and relating to the sea, 
      or, in other words, all transactions and proceedings relative to commerce 
      and navigation, and to damages or injuries upon the sea. Cowell, 
      Interpreter, voce "Admiral;" Spel. Gloss. voce "Admiral," sub finem; 
      Godolph. Jur. c. 1; 1 Valin, Comm. 1; Seld. De Dom. Mar. lib. 2, c. 16, p. 
      160; Stypman, Jus. Marit. par. 1, c. 6, pp. 76, 77; Id. par. 5, c. 1, p. 
      602; Loccenius, Jus. Marit. lib. 2, c. 2. In all the great maritime 
      nations of Europe, the terms "admiralty jurisdiction" are uniformly 
      applied to the courts exercising jurisdiction over maritime contracts and 
      concerns. We shall find the terms just as familiarly known among the 
      jurists of Scotland, France, Holland and Spain, as of England, and applied 
      to their own courts, possessing substantially the same jurisdiction, as 
      the English admiralty in the reign of Edward the Third. If we pass from 
      the etymology and use of these terms (i. e. "admiralty jurisdiction") in 
      foreign countries, the only expositions of them, that seem to present 
      themselves, are, that they refer, 1. To the jurisdiction of the admiralty 
      as acknowledged in England at the American Revolution; or, 2. At the 
      emigration of our ancestors; or 3. As acknowledged and exercised in the 
      United States at the American Revolution; or, 4. To the ancient and 
      original jurisdiction, inherent in the admiralty of England by virtue of 
      its general organization.</P>
      <P>As to the first exposition, it is difficult to perceive upon what 
      ground it can be reasonably maintained, for it would enlarge and limit the 
      jurisdiction by the provisions of statutes, which have been enacted for 
      the government and regulation of the high court of admiralty, and which 
      proprio vigore do not extend to the colonies. It would further involve 
      qualifications of the jurisdiction, which are perfectly arbitrary in 
      themselves, inapplicable to our situation, and contradictory to the 
      commissions and practice of the vice admiralty colonial courts. Even if 
      this exposition were to be adopted, are we to be governed by the doctrines 
      of the common law, or of the admiralty? I am not aware of any superior 
      sanctity in the decisions at common law upon the subject of the 
      jurisdiction of other courts (to which at least they bore no good will), 
      which should entitle them to outweigh the very able and learned decisions 
      of the great civilians of the admiralty. And where could we so properly 
      search for information on this subject, as in the works of those jurists, 
      who have adorned the maritime courts from age to age, and made its 
      jurisdiction the pride and study of their lives?</P>
      <P>The second exposition is liable to the same objections; for it is 
      clear, that the statutes of Richard do not extend in terms to the 
      colonies, and it is quite certain, that they were not included in any 
      supposed mischiefs, for they then had no existence. Besides, it is a very 
      material consideration, that, at the emigration of our ancestors, the 
      contest between the courts of common law and the admiralty was at its 
      height; and very soon after (in 1632) it was, by the agreement of the 
      twelve judges, decided in favor of the admiralty. And here again it may be 
      asked, whose doctrines are to be adopted, those of the common law or of 
      the admiralty?</P>
      <P>The third exposition requires an examination of the authority and 
      powers of the vice admiralty courts in the United States under the 
      colonial government. In some of the states, and probably in all, the crown 
      established, or reserved to itself the right to establish, admiralty 
      courts; and the nature and the extent of their jurisdictions depended upon 
      the commission of the crown, and upon acts of Parliament conferring 
      additional authorities. The commissions of the crown gave the courts, 
      which were established, a most ample jurisdiction over all maritime 
      contracts, and over torts and injuries, as well in ports as upon the high 
      seas. And acts of parliament enlarged, or rather recognised, this 
      jurisdiction by giving or confirming cognizance of all seizures for 
      contraventions of the revenue laws. The Fabius, 2 C. Rob. Adm. 245. 
      Tested, therefore, by this exposition, the admiralty jurisdiction of the 
      United States would be as large, as its most strenuous advocates ever 
      contended for.</P>
      <P>The clause however of the constitution not only confers admiralty 
      jurisdiction, but the word "maritime" is superadded, seemingly ex 
      industria, to remove every latent doubt. "Cases of maritime jurisdiction" 
      must include all maritime contracts, torts and injuries, which are in the 
      understanding of the common law, as well as of the admiralty, "causae 
      civiles et maritimae." In this view there is a peculiar property in the 
      incorporation of the term "maritime" into the constitution. The disputes 
      and discussions, respecting what the admiralty jurisdiction was, could not 
      but be well known to the framers of that instrument. Montgomery v. Henry, 
      1 Dall. [1 U. S.] 149; Talbot v. Commanders and Owners of Three Brigs, Id. 
      95. One party sought to limit it by locality; another by the subject 
      matter. It was wise, therefore, to dissipate all question by giving 
      cognizance of all "cases of maritime jurisdiction," or, what is precisely 
      equivalent, of all maritime cases. Upon any other construction, the word 
      "maritime" would be mere tautology; but in this sense it has a peculiar 
and<!--[Volume 4, Page 303]--> appropriate force. And Mr. Justice 
      Winchester (speaking with reference to contracts) has very correctly 
      observed, that "neither the judicial act nor the constitution, which it 
      follows, limit the admiralty jurisdiction of the district court in any 
      respect to place. It is bounded only by the nature of the cause, over 
      which it is to decide." Stevens v. The Sandwich [Case No. 13,409]. The 
      language of the constitution will therefore warrant the most liberal 
      interpretation; and it may not be unfit to hold, that it had reference to 
      that maritime jurisdiction, which commercial convenience, public policy, 
      and national rights, have contributed to establish, with slight local 
      differences, over all Europe; that jurisdiction, which, under the name of 
      consular courts, first established itself upon the shores of the 
      Mediterranean, and, from the general equity and simplicity of its 
      proceedings, soon commended itself to all the maritime states; that 
      jurisdiction, in short, which, collecting the wisdom of the civil law, and 
      combining it with the customs and usages of the sea, produced the 
      venerable Consolato del Mare, and still continues in its decisions to 
      regulate the commerce, the intercourse, and the warfare of mankind. Zouch, 
      c. 1, p. 87, etc.; Seld. ad Fletam, c. 8, § 5; Rob. Collect. Marit. 105, 
      note; Le Guidon, c. 3; 1 Emer. 21. Of this great system of maritime law it 
      may be truly said, "Non erit alia lex Romae, alia Athenis, alia nunc, alia 
      post-hac; sed et omnes gentes, et omni tempore, una lex et sempiterna et 
      immortalis, continebit." Cic. Frag. de Repub. lib. 3 (Editio Bost. 1817, 
      tom. 17, p. 186).</P>
      <P>At all events, there is no solid reason for construing the terms of the 
      constitution in a narrow and limited sense, or for ingrafting upon them 
      the restrictions of English statutes, or decisions at common law founded 
      on those statutes, which were sometimes dictated by jealousy, and 
      sometimes by misapprehension, which are often contradictory, and rarely 
      supported by any consistent principle. The advantages resulting to the 
      commerce and navigation of the United States, from a uniformity of rules 
      and decisions in all maritime questions, authorize us to believe that 
      national policy, as well as juridical logic, require the clause of the 
      constitution to be so construed, as to embrace all maritime contracts, 
      torts and injuries, or, in other words, to embrace all those causes, which 
      originally and inherently belonged to the admiralty, before any statutable 
      restriction. And most cordially do I subscribe to the opinion of the 
      learned Mr. Justice Winchester, in the case already cited (Stevens v. The 
      Sandwich [Case No. 13,409]), "that the statutes of Richard II. have 
      received in England a construction, which must at all times prohibit their 
      extension to this country," and "that no principles can be extracted from 
      the adjudged cases in England, which will explain or support the admiralty 
      jurisdiction, independent of the statutes or the works of jurists, who 
      have written on the general subject." Indeed the doctrine that would 
      extend the statutes of Richard to the present judicial power of the United 
      States seems little short of an absurdity. It is incorporating into the 
      text of the constitution an exception, not only unauthorized by its terms, 
      but wholly inappropriate in phraseology to any other realm than England. 
      We have not as yet any "admirals or their deputies;" we do not refer their 
      jurisdiction to the reign of "the most noble King Edward the Third;" much 
      less would an American citizen dream, that the constitution authorized the 
      admiralty "to arrest ships in the great flotes for the great voyages of 
      the king and of the realm;" and "to have jurisdiction upon the said flotes 
      during the said voyages only," and "saving always to the king all manner 
      of forfeitures and profits thereof coming," and "to the lords, cities and 
      boroughs their liberties and franchises."</P>
      <P>There are moreover decisions of the courts of the United States, which 
      completely establish the proposition, that the statutes of Richard, and 
      the common law construction of them, do not attach to this clause of the 
      constitution. We have already seen, that the courts of common law, after 
      these statutes, held, that the admiralty had no jurisdiction of things 
      done within the ebb and flow of the tide, in ports, creeks, and havens. It 
      has, notwithstanding, been repeatedly and solemnly held by the supreme 
      court, that all seizures under laws of impost, navigation and trade, on 
      waters navigable from the sea by vessels of ten or more tons burthen, as 
      well within ports and districts of the United States, as upon the high 
      seas, are causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. U. S. v. La 
      Vengeance, 3 Dall. [3 U. S.] 297; Same v. The Sally, 2 Cranch [6 U. S.] 
      406; Same v. The Betsey and Charlotte, 4 Cranch [8 U. S.] 443. This 
      limitation, as to the place of seizure, is prescribed by an act of 
      congress (Act Sept. 24, 1789, c. 20, § 9 [1 Stat. 76]), but it is 
      perfectly clear, that congress have no authority to include cases within 
      the admiralty jurisdiction, which the terms of the constitution did not 
      warrant. And the ground is made stronger by the consideration, that the 
      right of trial by jury is preserved by the constitution in all suits at 
      common law, where the value in controversy exceeds twenty dollars; and by 
      the statute, this right is excluded in all cases of admiralty and maritime 
      jurisdiction. It is therefore utterly impossible to reconcile these 
      decisions which in my humble judgment are founded in the most accurate and 
      just conceptions of the admiralty jurisdiction, with the narrow and 
      perplexed doctrines of the common law. The argument then, that attempts to 
      engraft them upon the constitution, is wholly untenable.</P>
      <P>On the whole, I am, without the slightest hesitation, ready to 
      pronounce, that the delegation of cognizance of "all civil cases of 
      admiralty and maritime jurisdiction" to the courts of the United States 
      comprehends all maritime contracts, torts, and injuries. The latter branch 
      is necessarily bounded by locality; the former extends over all contracts, 
      (wheresoever they may be made or executed, or whatsoever may be the form 
      of the stipulations,) which relate to the navigation, business or commerce 
      of the sea.</P>
      <P>The next inquiry is, what are properly to be deemed "maritime 
      contracts." Happily in this particular there is little room for 
      controversy. All civilians and jurists agree, that in this appellation are 
      included, among other things, charter parties, affreightments, marine 
      hypothecations, contracts for maritime service in the building, repairing, 
      supplying, and navigating ships; contracts between part owners of ships; 
      contracts and quasi contracts respecting averages, contributions and 
      jettisons; and, what is more material to our present purpose, policies of 
      insurance. S. P. Johnson, J., in Croudson v. Leonard, 4 Cranch [8 U. S.]<!--[Volume 4, Page 304]--> 434; Cleirac, Le Guidon, c. 1, p. 109; Id. 
      c. 3, p. 124; Id. Jurisd. de la Marine, p. 191; 1 Valin, Comm. 112, 120, 
      etc., 127, etc.; 2 Emer. 319; Godolph. 43; Zouch, 90, 92; Eaton, 69, etc., 
      295, etc.; Malyne, Lex Merc., 303; Id., Collection of Sea Laws, c. 2, p. 
      47; Consol. del Mare, c. 22; 2 Brown, Adm. c. 4, p. 71; 4 Bl. Comm. 67; 
      Stevens v. The Sandwich [supra]; Targa, Reflex. c. 1. And in point of fact 
      the admiralty courts of other foreign countries have exercised 
      jurisdiction over policies of insurance, as maritime contracts; and a 
      similar claim has been uniformly asserted on the part of the admiralty of 
      England. 2 Boucher, Consol. del Mare, p. 730; 1 Valin, Comm. 120; 2 Emer. 
      319; Roccus de Assec. note 80; 2 Brown, Adm. 80; Zouch. 92, 102; Molloy, 
      bk. 2, c. 7, § 18. There is no more reason why the admiralty should have 
      cognizance of bottomry instruments, as maritime contracts, than of 
      policies of insurance. Both are executed on land, and both intrinsically 
      respect maritime risks, injuries and losses.</P>
      <P>My judgment accordingly is, that policies of insurance are within 
      (though not exclusively within) the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of 
      the United States. I therefore overrule the plea to the jurisdiction, and 
      assign the respondent to answer peremptorily upon the merits.</P>
      <P>In making this decree, I am fully aware, that from its novelty it is 
      likely to be put to the question with more than usual zeal; nor can I 
      pretend to conjecture, how far a superior tribunal may deem it fit to 
      entertain the principles, which I have felt it my solemn duty to avow and 
      support. Whatever may be the event of this judgment, I shall console 
      myself with the memorable words of Lord Nottingham, in the great case of 
      the Duke of Norfolk, 3 Ch. Cas. 52: "I have made several decrees, since I 
      have had the honor to sit in this place, which have been reversed in 
      another place; and I was not ashamed to make them, nor sorry when they 
      were reversed by others."</P>
