<H2>MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF COMPLAINT</H2><IMG width="605" height="8" src="Carl's%20Corner,%20Lesson%20%231,%20Item%20%232_files/flagline.gif"> 
</CENTER>
<P>NOW COMES, THE PLAINTIFF/COMPLAINANT, JOHN Q. PUBLIC, IN PROPRIA PERSONA on 
his own behalf before this Honorable Court and brings this his just reason and 
cause of lawful authorities in support of his just complaint as follows:</P>
<P>Firstly, that the UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION IS THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND 
AND ALL COURTS ARE DUTY BOUND ON OATH TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND THAT UNITED STATES 
CONSTITUTION AS WELL AS THE STATE WHEREIN THEY RESIDE WHICH IS IN FULL AGREEMENT 
WITH THAT UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. This argument can be supported as follows; 
Please see Article VI section 2;</P>
<P>"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in 
Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the 
Authority of the United States, SHALL BE THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND; and the 
Judges in every State shall be bound thereby; any Thing in The Constitution or 
Laws of any State to the Contrary NOTWITHSTANDING."</P>
<P>Obviously, that NOTWITHSTANDING means what it says and means!! That is 
NO'IWITHSTANDING IN LAW!!! Now over the last TWO HUNDRED plus years there has 
been many a debate as to the validity of this Supremacy Doctrine and in most 
cases the famous Chief Judge John Marshall gave the deciding opinion in the 
matter of MARBURY vs. MADISON, 5 US 137, (1803) case were in the esteemed 
Justice John Marshall one of the most knowledgeable jurists in the whole history 
of the US Supreme Court made this decision; ALSO PLEASE SEE SHEPHERDS NOTATIONS, 
THIS CASE HAS NEVER BEEN OVERTURNED!!</P>
<P>Anything in Conflict or Repugnancy to the United States Constitution is NULL 
AND VOID OF LAW. It bears no power to enforce nor any obligation to obey such an 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL STATUTE, for it was UNCONSTITUTIONAL FROM IT'S VERY INCEPTION 
AND NOT MERELY FROM THE DATE SO BRANDING IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL. NO COURTS ARE 
BOUND TO UPHOLD IT AND NO CITIZENS ARE BOUND TO OBEY IT. SUCH A LAW OPERATES AS 
A MERE NULLITY AND HAS NO FORCE OF LAW. It is said of it that IT IS A FICTION OF 
LAW.</P>
<P>It clearly follows, that the original forefathers clearly meant for the 
Constitution to operate for all time in the best interest and protection of the 
Rights of the People, and as such wanted this TRUST administered by the 
Government operating in the best interest of each and every citizen for now and 
for all time. It follows that the Government was the TRUSTEE/FIDUCIARY, which 
means the one promising to follow the rules of the trust in the best interest of 
the BENEFICIARY and the BENEFICIARY WAS TO BE THE CITIZENS, each and everyone of 
them to the extent that each was a KING or QUEEN in their own right as long as 
they each respected their fellow citizens right to the same equal treatment. 
Unfortunately some Citizens are more equal than others!!! So my Rights 
officially end at my fellow citizens nose and as long as I am willing to respect 
that premise I am a sovereign FREEMAN in full possession of my Constitutional 
Rights as long as I am willing to timely defend them. It follows that first I 
must understand those Constitutional Rights and use them wisely with 
responsibility toward my fellow neighbor citizen. In other words I have a 
Constitutional Right to FREE SPEECH, but I can NOT yell fire in a crowded 
theater. Hence I have Rights as long as I recognize the fact that my neighbor 
also a Citizen has his/her Rights and for all of us to be equal and whole as to 
possession of those Constitutional Rights we must be willing to respect each 
Citizens Right TO BE SOVEREIGN AND FREE. The very famous Professor Albert 
Einstein said the actual value of "A CONSTITUTION" is the value each Citizen 
places in, That Constitution, protecting basic Rights, and their willingness TO 
DEFEND THAT CONSTITUTION!! Unfortunately, over a long period of LACK OF 
INTEREST, the Constitution has suffered a great deal of APATHY AND IGNORANCE 
thereby putting the principals in serious decline due to that LACK OF INTEREST. 
We desperately need to change this fact, because PUBLIC POLICY is more and more 
replacing our great heritage and the Constitutional Rights are literally going 
into infamy just on the extra judicial whim of some executive or potentate 
claiming Lawful authority to otherwise ignore the Constitution, and the basic 
Rights protected by that Constitution. Obviously this is what we hope to change 
for our better future!!! Now we further see that ALL OFFICERS OF GOVERNMENT are 
SWORN ON SACRED OATH to move timely to protect the Constitution from all enemies 
both FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC and to perform their DUTY to the best of their ability 
so help them GOD but no religious test is required to hold office. Please see 
Article VI para 3 Federal Constitution and Article II para 1 in the Michigan 
State Constitution. So we have established the DUTY TO TIMELY UPHOLD THE 
Constitution and the principles outlined under the Constitutions both FEDERAL 
AND STATE. This DUTY MAY NOT BE IGNORED!!! Please see BOYD vs. UNITED STATES, 
116 U S 616, " THE COURT HAS A DUTY TO PROTECT AGAINST ANY ENCROACHMENT OF 
CONSTITUTIONALLY SECURED LIBERTY." Further see WILLIAM BUTLER vs. UNITED STATES, 
297 US 1-88, " The Court has a DUTY TO UPHOLD THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION and 
the Rights protected UNDER THAT CONSTITUTION AND THE COURT IS NOT AT LIBERTY TO 
GIVE A MEANING THAT IS NOT WRITTEN IN THE CONSTITUTION NOR IS IT AT LIBERTY TO 
ADD A MEANING THAT IS NOT PHYSICALLY WRITTEN, NOR CAN THE COURT TURN ITS EYES 
FROM WHAT ALL OTHERS CAN SEE AND KNOW. Clearly, the Court is to decide and WHAT 
CAN NOT BE DONE OVERTLY MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED COVERTLY UNDER THE GUISE OF COLOR OF 
LAW." Clearly, THE DUTY TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION AND THE RIGHTS PROTECTED IS 
ESTABLISHED UNDER THE LAW AND THE STARE DECISIS ESTABLISHED BY THE UNITED STATES 
SUPREME COURT. Clearly, there is no latitude to do ANY THING other than ones 
sacred DUTY AND VIOLATION OF THAT DUTY IS A CAPITOL FELONY!!! Please see Title 
18 US Code section 2381, 2382, 2383, 2384, and 1621. Clearly our forefathers 
kind of wanted this DUTY TO BE HONORED AND MADE THE DISHONOR OF THAT DUTY A 
FELONY TREASON AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND GO OF THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!!! 
FACT!!! IT IS A SERIOUS MATTER TO BE SURE!!! "BUT I HAVE IMMUNITY," YOU HERE ALL 
THE TIME!!! THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FOR A CRIMINAL ACT OR TRESPASS ON SOMEONE'S 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS!!! YOU HOLD YOUR OFFICE DURING GOOD BEHAVIOR ONLY, AND IF 
YOU ARE A FELON YOU ARE NOT IN GOOD BEHAVIOR AND OBVIOUSLY NO IMMUNITY EXISTS TO 
BREAK THE LAW FOR ANYONE LET ALONE AN OFFICER OF THE LAW!!! FACT!!! The 
Constitution is OBVIOUSLY THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND AND NO AUTHORITY EXISTS TO 
IGNORE THE MANDATES OF THAT CONSTITUTION!!!! FACT!!!!</P>
<P>Next we need to understand how the Constitution is to be interpreted. By LAW 
THE CONSTITUTION IS SUPPOSE TO BE INTERPRETED IN FAVOR OF THE CLEARLY INTENDED 
BENEFICIARY THE CITIZEN FOR THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS AND PROPERTY. Please see 
BYARS vs. UNITED STATES 273 US 28 and 16th American Jurisprudence 2nd 
Constitutional Section 97, which clearly established that THE CONSTITUTION is to 
be interpreted to include the words, phrases, punctuation, and to include the 
INTENT of the FRAMER MADISON, HAMILTON, AND JAY, PUBLISHED IN THE FEDERALIST 
PAPERS by MADISON, HAMILTON, AND JAY who were the authors of the UNITED STATES 
CONSTITUTION, Please see COHEN vs. VIRGINIA 6 WHEAT 2, (1821) which upheld this 
book THE FEDERALIST PAPERS AS THE EXACT HISTORICAL RECORD OF THE INTENT OF THE 
FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION, and after figuring ALL THAT, THE CONSTITUTION IS TO 
BE INTERPRETED IN FAVOR OF THE CLEARLY INTENDED AND EXPRESSLY DESIGNATED 
BENEFICIARIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS AND PROPERTY. So we have more than 
substantiated that THE CONSTITUTION IS THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND AND THE 
COURTS ARE BOUND BY DUTY TO UPHOLD IT AS SUCH, and we have further determined 
that THE CONSTITUTION IS TO BE INTERPRETED IN FAVOR OF THE BENEFICIARIES THE 
CITIZEN SO I DO HAVE A RIGHT IF I CAN ARTICULATE THAT RIGHT AND THE LAW HAS A 
DUTY TO UPHOLD THAT RIGHT, AND IF I TIMELY ASSERT THAT RIGHT THE COURT MUST 
UPHOLD THAT RIGHT UNDER ITS OATH OF OFFICE AND THE DUTY CREATED UNDER THAT OATH 
AND OFFICE THERE IS NO LATITUDE TO DO ANY OTHER ACT!!! FACT!!!!</P>
<P>Next, let us examine the 4th AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.</P>
<P>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and 
effects, against UNREASONABLE searches and seizures, SHALL NOT BE VIOLATED, AND 
NO WARRANTS SHALL ISSUE, but upon PROBABLE CAUSE, supported by OATH OR 
AFFIRMATION, and particularity describing the place to be searched, and the 
persons or things to be seized. </P>
<P>I do not think it gets ANY CLEARER THAN THAT!!! THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO BE 
SECURE IN THEIR PERSONS, WALKING OR DRIVING DOWN THE STREET, HOUSES, THEIR HOMES 
BACKYARDS OR MOTEL ROOMS, PAPERS, RELATING TO THEIR BUSINESS MATTERS AND 
PERSONAL PRIVACY AND EFFECTS, WELL A CAR IS AN EFFECT, AGAINST UNREASONABLE 
SEARCHES OR SEIZURES, WHEN ARE WE UNREASONABLE, WHEN THERE IS NO WARRANT 
SUPPORTED BY OATH OR AFFIRMATION DESCRIBING IN DETAIL THE PLACE, PERSONS AND OR 
PROPERTY TO BE SEARCHED AND OR SEIZED. Obviously our FOREFATHERS HAD SEEN SOME 
VARIETY OF CHECK LANES IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL LIVES AND THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT TO 
MENTION IT FOURTH ON THE LIST OF BILL OF RIGHTS AND HEY, HISTORY HAS COME FULL 
CIRCLE AGAIN!!! DE JEVUE, I DON'T THINK SO!!! The RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE, the 
United States Supreme Court says, means the RIGHT OF ALL THE PEOPLE EACH AND 
EVERYONE OF THEM IN THEIR OWN RIGHT TO POSSESS THE RIGHT WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, 
COLOR, RELIGION OR ETHNIC BACKGROUND AND THAT RIGHT SHALL NOT BE 
VIOLATED!!!!!!!!! HOW COME THE CITY OF DETROIT IS GOING TO VIOLATE IT BY 
IMPLEMENTING BROAD SWEEPING CHECK LANES TO OPENLY STOP INNOCENT PARTIES WITHOUT 
A WARRANT OR PROBABLE CAUSE, TO DO SO AND JUST VIOLATE THERE PERSON, PAPERS AND 
EFFECTS FOR NO JUST OR LAWFUL REASON?????? WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A CLEAR CONFLICT 
WITH THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION!!!! FACT!!!! 
Please see the case NORTON vs. SHELBY COUNTY, 188 US 425, "AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
ACT IS NOT LAW; it confers no rights; it IMPOSES no duties; affords no 
protection; it creates no office; it is in legal contemplation, as an 
inoperative as though it had never been passed. It is a mere nullity." Further, 
anyone who operates under such a LAW OR COLOR OF A LAW DOES SO AT HIS OWN 
PERIL!!!!! There is NO IMMUNITY FOR A CRIMINAL TRESPASS OR ANY CRIMINAL ACT FOR 
THAT MATTER. Please see Exhibit "A" attached hereto the record. Also see OWENS 
vs. CITY OF INDEPENDENCE Mo. 100 S.Ct. 1398, (1982) case and MANE vs. THIBITOUT, 
100 S.Ct. 2502, (1982) case and these cases holding that there is NO IMMUNITY 
FOR VIOLATION OF A CITIZENS CONSTITUTIONALLY RIGHTS and that Officers are deemed 
to be expert on the LAW and to advise to the LAW and give example of the LAW and 
could hardly claim ignorance of the LAW for a citizen may not use ignorance of 
the LAW as an excuse and it makes the LAW look incompetent for a duly sworn 
OFFICER to claim ignorance of the LAW, SO NO JUDICIAL IMMUNITY EXISTS FOR 
VIOLATION OF A CITIZENS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. Further, Article 3 clause 1 very 
clearly states " JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT AND INFERIOR COURTS HOLD THEIR 
OFFICE DURING GOOD BEHAVIOR, and PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS NO STIPULATION FOR 
HOLDING THEIR Office during BAD BEHAVIOR, so obviously, officers do NOT HOLD 
THEIR Office during bad behavior, and as such can claim no immunity from such 
unlawful act. SO CLEARLY, THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FOR IGNORING A CITIZENS 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, AND YOU PROCEED AT YOUR OWN PERIL IF YOU FOLLOW AN 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACT OR LAW UNDER COLOR OF LAW. ERGO, YOU HAVE NO DEFENSE TO THE 
COMPLAINT IN A SUIT FOR INJURY!!!! Also THE CLAIM AND EXERCISE OF A 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT CAN NOT BE CONVERTED INTO A CRIME!!! Please see MILLER vs. 
UNITED STATES, 230 F2d 486. The Constitution must be interpreted in favor of the 
citizen beneficiary and the Constitution is the SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND!!!! Are 
we starting to get the full picture here????? JUST DON'T START CRYING FOWL WHEN 
YOU GET SUED!!! YOU WERE Warned!!!! THE NEW POLICE CHECK LANE POLICY IS TOTALLY 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!! FACT!!!! YOU KEEP PLAYING AROUND AND YOU ARE GOING TO GET 
SUED BIG TIME!!!! Now add to this SHAPERIRO vs. THOMPSON, 394 US 618, All 
Citizens must be free to travel throughout the United States uninhibited by 
statutes, rules or regulations and that it is a basic concomitant of a free 
society to be able to travel throughout unencumbered, says the US SUPREME COURT 
and further HURTADO vs. CALIFORNIA, 110 US 516, "THE STATE CAN NOT DIMINISH THE 
RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE!!!" Oh I know you got POLICE POWERS AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING 
FOR THE COMMON GOOD AND WELFARE, AND TO CURB CRIME, AND YOU ALWAYS FORGET ---- 
WITHIN CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS SEE THE 10th AMENDMENT!!! You people always 
forget that punch line within CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS!!! ARE THERE ANY 
LIMITATIONS???? OH YEAH!!!! YOU WERE JUST NOT LOOKING VERY HARD!!!</P>
<P>You see the 4th FOURTH AMENDMENT IS A LIMITATION AND IT VERY CLEARLY LAYS OUT 
EXACTLY WHAT MUST BE DONE, AND IT VERY CLEARLY SAYS THAT RIGHT SHALL NOT BE 
VIOLATED!!!!! YOU ARE VIOLATING BY PASSING A LAW THAT TOTALLY AVOIDS THE 
REQUIREMENTS OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION!!! 
FACT!!!! On top of that you are passing a LAW which takes away other rights 
which are retained by the UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION IN THE (4th) FOURTH 
AMENDMENT WHICH IS A VIOLATION OF THE (9th)NINTH AMENDMENT!!! LAST TIME I WENT 
TO SCHOOL 9 comes before 10th so ANOTHER LIMITATION HAS BEEN VIOLATED!!!! 
FACT!!! Now getting back to the (10th) TENTH AMENDMENT POLICE POWERS as one can 
readily see you have exceeded your lawful authority and gone outside the 
LIMITATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY!!! FACT!!! Next, we go to the (14th) 
FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AND I ask you can a state deprive ANY CITIZEN of his 
RIGHTS, PRIVILEGES OR IMMUNITIES AND ESPECIALLY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW???? 
NO, YOU CAN'T, I AND I DON'T CARE HOW HIGH A COMMISSIONER OR MAYOR OR JUDGE YOU 
ARE IT CAN NOT BE DONE LAWFULLY!!!!! FACT!!! Can you see how some hot shot 
LAWYER is going to rip you a new tail feather if you continue on this ill fated 
course of POLICE CHECK LANES. YOU DO NOT EVEN HAVE A DEFENSE BY LAW AND 
IGNORANCE IS NO EXCUSE AND NO IMMUNITY EXISTS FOR VIOLATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL 
RIGHTS AND THE CONSTITUTION IS SUPPOSED TO BE INTERPRETED IN FAVOR OF THE 
CITIZEN BENEFICIARY AND CAN THE TRUSTEE EVER INJURE THE BENEFICIARY???? HELL 
NO!!!! REMEMBER YOU ARE A TRUSTEE!!! Please see PEOPLE Ex REL vs. GOVERNOR, 29 
MICHIGAN 327, " THE TRUTH IS, NO OFFICER, NO MATTER HOW HIGH, IS ABOVE THE 
LAW!!!!" Clearly, we have a serious problem if you choose to go forward with 
this POLICE CHECK LANE SCENARIO!!!! YOU PROCEED AT YOUR OWN PERIL AND YOU ARE 
LIABLE AND CAN BE SUED AND CRIMINALLY CHARGED UNDER 18 US Code section 241 and 
242 Criminally and Title 42 US Code section 1983, 1985, and 1986 civilly and all 
I have to do to substantiate a case is verify that on such and such date IT 
HAPPENED and hell the Court file will verify that and then it is just a matter 
of getting the ACTORS OR PLAYERS NAMES and hey your names will be in the paper 
and on the approval of the ordinance and how you voted for or against. Next, I 
need a sworn complaint of the facts and available witnesses and hey IT IS A DONE 
DEAL!!!! DO YOU STILL WANT TO PLAY WITH THE CITIZENRY ON THIS RIDICULOUS POLICE 
CHECK LANE IDEA???? I should tell you the US Supreme Court has ruled that check 
lanes are UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!! FACT!!!! I will save that case for you and let 
you do a little home work on your own!!!! YOU SAY IT WILL NEVER FLY , HEY, DON'T 
B. S. A KIDDER!!! YOU PEOPLE GAVE THE MALICE GREEN FAMILY AROUND 15 million OUT 
OF COURT NO QUESTIONS and you had a better case that time than you will have 
with this check lane program. YOU DO NOT HAVE A DEFENSE!!!! COUNSEL WILL OVER 
AND OVER STATE CLEARLY YOU KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THIS WAS 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THE SUPREME COURT SAID IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!! WHAT THE 
HELL WERE YOU THINKING OF WHEN YOU CONCOCTED THIS CHECK LANE IDEA! YOU ARE GOING 
TO GET THE THRASHING OF YOUR LIFE, BUT HEY, DON'T LET ME INFLUENCE YOU!!! 
WARNING, WARNING, DANGER, DANGER, WHERE HAVE YOU HEARD THAT BEFORE?????</P>
<P>You keep playing with fire and you will get your butt burned!!! FACT!!! Now 
let us take a good look at some of the most recent cases in STARE DECISIS AND 
GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHERE YOU ARE AT, JUST IN CASE, YOU ARE STILL NOT CONVINCED 
OF YOUR PERILOUS TACT WITH THESE CHECK LANES. " For an arrest to be valid under 
the FOURTH AMENDMENT US CONSTITUTION, PROBABLE CAUSE MUST FIRST EXIST!!!!", 
Please see FUNAWAY vs. NEW YORK, 445 US 573 (1980) case. "Courts MUST be 
especially cautious when the evidence that is alleged to establish PROBABLE 
CAUSE is entirely consistent with innocent behavior." Please see REID vs. 
GEORGIA, 448 US 438, (1980) case. You have no PROBABLE CAUSE and you can not get 
any more innocent that going to the grocery store on a sunny after noon or a 
movie theater or to K MARTS or GOD KNOWS HOW MANY ANY OTHER INNOCENT BEHAVIORS 
COULD BE COMPARED!!! You are not looking at that defense, I hope!!!! IT IS NO 
DEFENSE!!! FACT!!! On top of this PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO REFUSE TO PROVIDE 
INFORMATION TO POLICE. please see MOYA vs. US 761 F2d 322, 7th Circuit (1985), 
BROWN vs. TEXAS, 443 US 47 (1979) case. " The Constitution protects individuals 
against invasion of their privacy by the Government." RIMIE vs. CITY OF HEDWIG 
VILLAGE, TEXAS, 765 F2d 490 (1985) case, WHALEN vs. ROE, 429 US 589 (1977) case. 
YOU ARE INVADING THE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY OF EACH DRIVER WITHOUT PROBABLE 
CAUSE AND YOU ARE ON VERY DANGEROUS GROUND WITHOUT A NET. KEEP DANCING OUT THERE 
ON THAT LIMB LIKE HUMPTY DUMPTY AND YOU WILL GET YOUR GREAT FALL!!! Absent some 
SPECIAL EXCEPTION, ALL CONTAINERS AND PACKAGES WILL RECEIVE THE FULL PROTECTION 
OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT DURING A POLICE SEARCH. US vs. BONITZ, 826 F2d 954 
(1987) case. Warrantless search of a grocery bag which provided probable cause 
for arrest, held not justified incident to arrest. US vs. MOST, 876 F2d 191 
(1989) case. If you can NOT even search a grocery bag or a purse or any closed 
container, how are you going to randomly search twenty or thirty cars at a 
time????? Even if Police have a warrant, A fact that a person is in the company 
of person for whom a warrant has been issued does not constitute probable cause 
for search of that person. US vs. PRIETO-VILLA, 910 F2d 601 (1990) case. You do 
not even have a warrant, can you see the difficulty here???? Absent exigent 
circumstances or CONSENT, Officer is NOT to search locked suitcase without a 
search warrant. see FLORIDA vs. WELLS, 495 US 1 (1990) case. YOU GOT NO CONSENT 
NOR A WARRANT, HOW DO YOU LAWFULLY SEARCH A COUPLE DOZEN CARS AT A TIME???? 
Unless exigent circumstances exist, WARRANTLESS SEARCHES ARE IMPERMISSIBLE!!!! 
FACT!!!! US vs. Almonte, 952 F2d 20 (1991) case. As long as the police do not 
convey a message that compliance with their requests is required they can ask 
questions, request to search, and request ID for you always have a right to shut 
up and walk away. US vs. Childs, 944 F2d 491 (1991) case. Search warrants MUST 
describe both the place to be searched and things to be seized with 
particularity. US vs. BROWN 984 F2d 1074 (1993) case. YOU HAVE NO WARRANT FOR 
YOUR POLICE CHECK LANES FOLLOWING THIS MANDATE!!!! FACT!!! Exercise of right to 
refuse consent to search can NOT alone be basis of reasonable suspicion 
supporting detention of suspect. US vs. MANUEL, 992 F2d 272 (1993) case. 
Excessive force during arrest violates a persons FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHT AGAINST 
UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES. SWOBODA vs. DUBACH, 992 F2d 286 (1993) case. 
Can you see a MALICE GREEN CASE HERE????? IF YOU GET ONE YOU LOSE!!!! YOU GOT NO 
WARRANT TO SEARCH, BECAUSE YOU GOT NO PROBABLE CAUSE AND YOU DID NOT GO GET THE  
WARRANT ERGO YOU LOSE!!!! AGAIN UNREASONABLE SEARCH!!!! FACT!!! You see NO 
WARRANT AND IT IS AN UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND IN VIOLATION!!!! FACT!!! YOU 
LOSE!!!! Probable cause to arrest does not automatically provide probable cause 
to search. US vs. JONES, 994 F2d 1051, (1993) case. Without evidence or exigent 
circumstances or consent Police may not search without a warrant. US vs. Parra, 
2 F3d 1058 (1993) case, PEYTON vs. NEW YORK, 445 US 573 (1980) case. Obviously 
POLICE MUST HAVE A WARRANT TO SEARCH OTHERWISE IT IS UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND ALL 
EVIDENCE GLEANED IS FRUIT OF THE POISON TREE DOCTRINE AND ABSOLUTELY 
INADMISSIBLE FOR ANY PRACTICABLE PURPOSE!!! YOU LOSE AGAIN AND YOU NEVER GOT 
WARRANTS ANYWAY YOU WANTED TO PULL OVER THREE DOZEN AT A TIME AND OBVIOUSLY 
THERE JUST WAS NO TIME FOR ALL THOSE WARRANTS. FINE, YOU GOT NO EVIDENCE EVEN IF 
YOU FIND SOMETHING FOR ANY LAWYER WORTH HIS SALT WILL IMMEDIATELY MOVE TO STRIKE 
SUCH EVIDENCE AS FRUIT OF THE POISON TREE DOCTRINE!!! NOW WHAT HOLDS YOUR CASE 
TOGETHER???? NAHDA!!!! FACT!!! YOU LOSE AND GET SUED!!!! DUMB HUH!!!! FOURTH 
AMENDMENT PROTECTS EXPECTATIONS OF PRIVACY IN MOVABLE CLOSED CONTAINERS, AND 
THAT INCLUDES AUTOMOBILES UNLESS YOU GOT A WARRANT!!! YOU GOT A WARRANT???? NO!! 
TO BAD!!!, US vs. GOOCH 6 F3d 673 (1993) case. Exigent circumstance justifies 
warrantless entry only where there is probable cause to enter and search. US vs. 
JOHNSON, 9 F3d 506 (1993) case. Police themselves can NOT create exigent 
circumstance such that warrant requirements will be suspended under exigent 
circumstance exception. US vs. HALLIMAN, 923 F2d 873 (1991) case. This is 
exactly what you are doing wrong on a POLICE CHECK LANE!!!! FACT!!! YOU ARE 
CREATING EXIGENCY ON THE WHIM OF THE OFFICER TO SEARCH ON SOME SUPPOSED PROBABLE 
CAUSE AND THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS TREND WE DO NOT want to test!!!! FACT!!! THAT 
IS HOW MALICE GREEN CASES GET GOING!!!! Government has the burden of proof 
CONSENT to search by a preponderance of the evidence. US vs. HODGE, 19 F3d 51 
(1994) case. YOU GOT NO CONSENT AND YOU GOT NO WARRANT SO WHAT AUTHORITY DO YOU 
GOT TO STOP AND SEARCH EVERY CAR!!! YOU GOT NAHDA!!! YOU LOSE!!! PAY THE 
PLAINTIFF TO INCLUDE PUNITIVE DAMAGES FOR ABUSE!!!! Because interrogation and 
search were direct result of  ILLEGAL TRAFFIC STOP, ALL EVIDENCE HAD TO BE 
STRICKEN OR SUPPRESSED. US vs. MILIAN, 36 F3d 886 (1994) case. DID YOU HEAR 
THAT???? ALL EVIDENCE HAD TO BE STRICKEN!!!! THAT MEANS THE CASE YOU THOUGHT YOU 
HAD YOU JUST LOST AND NOW YOU GET COUNTER SUED FOR THE DAMAGES!!!! Fourth 
Amendment FORBIDS UNWARRANTED INTRUSION OR TRESPASS. US vs. HALL 47 F3d 
1091(1995) case. A search by Government agents is presumptively UNREASONABLE 
under the FOURTH AMENDMENT UNLESS CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO WARRANT ISSUED BY 
JUDICIAL OFFICER UPON FINDING OF PROBABLE CAUSE. BINGO!!! US vs. WARREN, 42 F3d 
647 (1994) case. YOU GOT WARRANTS FOR EVERY CAR OUT THERE???? RIDICULOUS ISN'T 
IT???? YOU LOSE JUDGMENT FOR THE PLAINTIFF!!!! Suspicion is not such " 
REASONABLE SUSPICION" as will justify investigatory stop if IT IS NO MORE THAN 
INCHOATE AND UNPARTICULARIZED OR "HUNCH". US vs. GARCIA, 23 F3d 1331 (1994) 
case. DID YOU HEAR THAT????? A HUNCH WILL NOT DO!!!! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK 
THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF THE CHECK LANE IS DOING OUT THERE ON A HUNCH THIS 
STREET OR THAT STREET WILL PRODUCE BETTER RESULTS OR NON RESULTS!!! MAN CAN YOU 
SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING???? STRAIGHT TO HELL IN A HAND CART!!! One of the 
leading cases in Supreme Court history, TERRY vs. OHIO, 392 US 1 (1968) case and 
it says "FOR AN INVESTIGATIVE STOP TO BE VALID THERE MUST BE ARITICUABLE 
SUSPICION BEFORE YOU MAY STOP AND SEARCH." Now tell me you got REASONABLE 
ARITICUABLE SUSPICION FOR EVERY CAR COMING DOWN SAY WOODWARD AVE. ON A CROWDED 
MONDAY MORNING AND I will tell you what you can do with your case!!!! YOU 
LOSE!!! NO JURY IN THE WORLD WILL BUY THAT APPLE 'CAUSE THEY SEEN TOP COPS AND 
WE KNOW WHAT GOES ON OUT THERE ON THE STREET!!!! CHECK MATE!!! YOU LOSE PAY THE 
PLAINTIFF ALL REASONABLE REAL AND PERSONALLY COMPENSATORY DAMAGES PLUS PUNITIVE 
DAMAGES FOR ABUSE OF PROCESS!!!! CLEARLY YOU KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT THE 
HELL YOU WERE DOING OUT WHEN YOU VIOLATED THAT GOOD CITIZEN AND CLEARLY YOU OR 
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN A WARRANT TO SEARCH WAS INDEED REQUIRED. OH, YOU SAY, "YOU 
SCREWED UP!!!" BINGO!!! I KNEW THAT FROM THE GET GO!!! Now, Passenger has 
standing to challenge constitutionality of vehicle stop given that stop results 
in seizure of passenger. JACKSON vs. VANNOY 49 F3d 175 (1995) case. You see even 
the passenger has standing to SUE YOU FOR THE ILLEGAL STOP!!!! Government bears 
entirely burden of proving by preponderance of evidence that consent to search 
was freely and voluntarily given. US vs. SAADEH 61 F3d 510 (1995). you will love 
the next one!!! FOURTH AMENDMENT DOES NOT ALLOW RANDOM SEARCHES OF PERSONS 
TRAVELING THE NATIONS HIGHWAYS. PLEASE SEE KARNES vs. SKRUTSKI 62 F3d 485 (1995) 
case. I think that really capped the ice on the whole matter. Can you understand 
why the TAX PAYERS MAY NOT TO BACK YOUR PLAY ON THIS GAMBLE???? You are going to 
LOSE IF IT GET TO COURT WITH A GUTSY ATTORNEY AND A CLIENT WHO WILL NOT QUIT!!!! 
YOU WILL NOT HAVE ONE HONEST DEFENSE, NOT ONE!!!! FACT!!!! Consent encounters 
and searches are valid only if suspect's consent was freely and voluntarily 
given. US vs. NOBELS, 69 F3d 172 (1995) case. Warrant MUST be gotten and MUST 
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBE THE PLACE, THE PERSON TO BE SEARCHED AND THE PERSON OR 
THING TO BE SEIZED TO BE VALID. US vs. LAYNE 43 F3d 127 (1995) case. Again no 
warrant. AGAIN YOU LOSE THE SEARCH IS UNREASONABLE AND YOU HAVE NO CONSENT OR 
PROBABLE CAUSE. Absent exigent circumstances, POLICE OFFICERS MAY NOT UNDERTAKE 
WARRANTLESS SEARCH. US vs. BIGGS, 70 F3d 913 (1995) case . Scope of consent 
search is limited by the breadth of consent given. US vs. WAKER 72 F3d 1453 
(1995) case. UNLAWFUL SEARCH CAN NEVER BE JUSTIFIED BY ITS FRUITS. PARKHURST vs. 
TRAPP 77 F3d 707 (1996) case. FOURTH AMENDMENT PROHIBITS POLICE FROM MAKING 
WARRANTLESS NONCONSENSUAL ENTRY OR SEARCHES. US vs. COTNAM 88 F3d 487 (1996). 
Now I trust you can see the precarious position you are placing yourselves in by 
playing this ridiculous CHECK LANE SCENARIO. IT IS BAD FOR OUR CITY ALL AROUND 
AND contrary to popular belief it benefits the police posture in the community 
not even a little. It creates all manner of hostilities between the citizens and 
the Police which in the long run actually hurt Police community relations and 
further hamstring the Officers when they have to go out into the community and 
seek assistance on some special case. The officers are literally spit on and 
lets face it, a lot of officers do one hell of a job, also contrary to popular 
belief. There are a few bad apples, but I believe they are the exception rather 
than the rule. I am totally against the tearing down of the Officers or the 
Constitutional Rights of the Citizens and this check lane plan can only work to 
do ALL PARTIES IRREPARABLE HARM. I URGE YOU TO DO THE RIGHT AND INTELLIGENT 
THING. VOTE DOWN THIS CHECK LANE IDEA AS OLD GARBAGE, WE TRIED IT, AND WE 
SCRAPPED IT, IN 1967. Let us now move THE GREAT CITY OF DETROIT ON TO BIGGER AND 
BIGGER and forget about looking backwards to a time when burn baby burn was the 
hue and cry. Tell these PUBLIC POLICY IDIOTS FROM THE CHICAGO THINK TANK TO GO 
FLY A KITE!!! THEY ARE ALL MORONS ANYWAY AND LET THEM TRY IT IN CHICAGO, WE 
ALREADY TRIED IT HERE, AND IT SUCKED BIG TIME. TELL THEM TO PUT AN EGG IN THEIR 
SHOE AND BEAT IT OUT OF OUR FAIR TOWN AND GO BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM. </P>
<P>IN SUMMATION: I think you have seen enough to sink a battleship but to simply 
review. The Constitution is the SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND. THE US SUPREME COURT 
HAS HELD IT AS SUCH AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO!!! FACT!! The RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE 
ARE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE EACH AND NOT JUST FOR A MINORITY FEW. THE RIGHTS ARE 
SUPPOSED TO BE UPHELD IN FAVOR OF THE CITIZEN SO HE/SHE HAS A HONEST RIGHT TO 
THEIR VIEW OF THEIR RIGHTS AND THE COURT MUST MOVE TIMELY TO PROTECT THEIR 
RIGHTS. THE FORTH AMENDMENT CLEARLY FORBIDS THE POLICE CHECK LANES AS BEING 
UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND SEIZURE AND YOU HAVE ENOUGH COURT CASES TO SINK THE 
U.S.S. ALABAMA. YOU WILL HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO LAWFUL DEFENSE IF YOU CHOOSE TO 
IMPLEMENT THESE POLICE CHECK LANES IF SOMEONE DECIDES TO SUE YOU, AND YOU ARE 
PROCEEDING AT YOUR VERY PERIL IF YOU GO FORWARD. I WOULD GRACIOUSLY SUGGEST, YOU 
NOT GO FORWARD, WITH THIS ILL-ADVISED POLICE CHECK LANE POLICY. OBVIOUSLY IT IS 
A FREE COUNTRY, BUT CONSIDER WISELY. Remember you are free but there are 
responsibilities to your neighbor citizens. Lets not return to knuckle dragging 
Neanderthal days of S.T.R.E.S.S., WE HAVE COME TO FAR. You saw haw bad we got 
beat up by the NEWS MEDIA ON THAT MALICE GREEN THING,  WELL WELCOME TO MANY 
POSSIBLE MALICE GREEN SCENARIOS. THIS IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CITY OF 
DETROIT OR ITS CITIZENRY!!!!! FACT!!!! WE NEED TO TAKE CAREFUL COUNCIL, AND 
CHOOSE WISELY FOR OUR FUTURE, AND THE NEW DETROIT WE HOPE TO ONE DAY BRING 
ABOUT. WE DO NOT NEED A POLICE GESTAPO MENTALITY RUNNING AROUND YELLING FOR YOUR 
PAPERS PLEASE. ACHTUNG!!! ACHTUNG!!! YOUR PAPERS PLEASE!!! I think you have a 
grasp of the problem, and I only hope you take to heart a just and serious 
solution, and not reflex react to some tiny minds who have no hope for the 
future, and I honestly believe, wish to cap our progress to date. I thank you 
for your valuable time in regards this matter, I and look forward to hearing 
that you tabled this subject permanently in the file 13, WHERE IT TRULY 
BELONGS!!!!</P>
<P>THANK YOU AGAIN AND I REMAIN MOST RESPECTFULLY YOURS:</P>
<P>AMICUS CURAE</P>
